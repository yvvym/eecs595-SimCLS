homarus gammarus , known as the european lobster or common lobster , is a species of < unk > lobster from the eastern atlantic ocean , mediterranean sea and parts of the black sea . it is closely related to the american lobster , h . americanus . it may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . in life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking . mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into < unk > larvae . homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the british isles .

homarus gammarus is a large < unk > , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @ . @ 7 – 2 @ . @ 2 kg ( 1 @ . @ 5 – 4 @ . @ 9 lb ) . like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard < unk > which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called < unk > ( < unk > ) . this may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals .
the first pair of < unk > is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . the larger one is the " < unk > " , and has rounded < unk > used for crushing prey ; the other is the " cutter " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . usually , the left claw is the < unk > , and the right is the cutter .
the < unk > is generally blue above , with spots that < unk > , and yellow below . the red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . this occurs because , in life , the red pigment < unk > is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment .
the closest relative of h . gammarus is the american lobster , homarus americanus . the two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . the two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics :
the < unk > of h . americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in h . gammarus .
the spines on the claws of h . americanus are red or red @ - @ tipped , while those of h . gammarus are white or white @ - @ tipped .
the underside of the claw of h . americanus is orange or red , while that of h . gammarus is creamy white or very pale red .
= = life cycle = =
female h . gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @ . @ 1 – 3 @ . @ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . mating typically occurs in summer between a recently < unk > female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @ - @ shelled male . the female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her < unk > . females carrying eggs are said to be " < unk > " and can be found throughout the year .
the eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on < unk > . this stage involves three < unk > and lasts for 15 – 35 days . after the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a < unk > lifestyle . the juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . it is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @ , @ 000 survives to the < unk > phase . when they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @ . @ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives .
= = distribution = =
homarus gammarus is found across the north @ - @ eastern atlantic ocean from northern norway to the azores and morocco , not including the baltic sea . it is also present in most of the mediterranean sea , only missing from the section east of crete , and along only the north @ - @ west coast of the black sea . the < unk > populations are found in the norwegian < unk > < unk > and < unk > , inside the arctic circle .
the species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . the first of these is the population of lobsters from northern norway , which have been referred to as the " midnight @ - @ sun lobster " . the populations in the mediterranean sea are distinct from those in the atlantic ocean . the last distinct population is found in the netherlands : samples from the < unk > were distinct from those collected in the north sea or english channel .
attempts have been made to introduce h . gammarus to new zealand , alongside other european species such as the edible crab , cancer < unk > . between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from < unk > in < unk > , but the species did not become established there .
= = ecology = =
adult h . gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – < unk > ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . they prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed .
the diet of h . gammarus mostly consists of other < unk > invertebrates . these include crabs , molluscs , sea < unk > , < unk > and polychaete worms .
the three < unk > lobster species homarus gammarus , h . americanus and < unk > < unk > are hosts to the three known species of the animal < unk > < unk > ; the species on h . gammarus has not been described .
homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease < unk > , caused by the < unk > < unk > < unk > . although it is frequently found in american lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive h . gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by h . americanus could not be ruled out .
= = human consumption = =
homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " as a < unk > and was mentioned in " the < unk > " a seventeenth century english folk song . it may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . both the claws and the abdomen of h . gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . the exceptions are the < unk > mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) . the price of h . gammarus is up to three times higher than that of h . americanus , and the european species is considered to have a better flavour .
< unk > are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines < unk > with < unk > or < unk > sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . in 2008 , 4 @ , @ 386 t of h . gammarus were caught across europe and north africa , of which 3 @ , @ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the british isles ( including the channel islands ) . the minimum landing size for h . gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @ . @ 4 in ) .
< unk > systems for h . gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low .
= = < unk > history = =
homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by carl linnaeus in the tenth edition of his systema < unk > , published in 1758 . that name was cancer gammarus , since linnaeus ' concept of the genus cancer at that time included all large crustaceans .
h . gammarus is the type species of the genus homarus weber , 1795 , as determined by direction 51 of the international commission on zoological nomenclature . prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including < unk > < unk > < unk > , 1775 and homarus vulgaris h . milne @ - @ edwards , 1837 , and also because friedrich weber ' s description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by mary < unk > , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for homarus h . milne @ - @ edwards , 1837 ) invalid for homarus weber , 1795 .
the type specimen of homarus gammarus was a < unk > selected by < unk > < unk > in 1974 . it came from 57 ° 53 ′ n 11 ° 32 ′ e , near < unk > , sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of gothenburg ) , but both it and the < unk > have since been lost .
the common name for h . gammarus preferred by the food and agriculture organization is " european lobster " , but the species is also widely known as the " common lobster " .

= = history = =
previously inhabited by the < unk > native americans , the area now called meridian was obtained by the united states under the terms of the treaty of dancing < unk > creek in 1830 during the period of indian < unk > . after the treaty was ratified , european @ - @ american settlers began to move into the area .
after receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @ , @ 000 acres ( < unk > ha ) , richard < unk > , the first settler of meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . most of < unk > ' s land was bought in 1853 by lewis a . < unk > , a lawyer from alabama . john t . ball , a merchant from < unk > county , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 @ . @ 32 km2 ) . < unk > and ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections .
there was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name " meridian , " believing the term to be synonymous with " junction " ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred " < unk > " ( meaning " mad river " in a native american language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and < unk > proposed " < unk > city . " ball erected a station house on the mobile and ohio railroad – the sign on which would alternate between " meridian " and " < unk > " each day . eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left " meridian " on the station permanently . the town was officially incorporated as meridian on february 10 , 1860 .
meridian was a small village at the start of the american civil war in 1861 . its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . during the battle of meridian in 1864 , general william < unk > sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense < unk > ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . sherman is reported to have said afterwards , " meridian , with its depots , store @ - @ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and < unk > no longer exists . " despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle . race relations remained tense during the reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses .
the town < unk > in the aftermath of the civil war , and experienced its " golden age " from 1880 to 1910 . the railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . as the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . between 1890 and 1930 , meridian was the largest city in mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the south . many of the city ' s historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the grand opera house in 1890 , the < unk > school in 1894 , two carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the < unk > building , meridian ' s tallest skyscraper , in 1929 .
the city continued to grow thanks to a commission government ' s efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following great depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . with < unk > becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the depression , the s . h . kress & co . building , built to " provide luxury to the common man , " opened in downtown meridian , as did the temple theater , which was used as a movie house . the federal < unk > was built in 1933 as a < unk > project .
after a brief < unk > of the economy at the end of the depression , the country entered world war ii , which renewed the importance of railroads . the rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so meridian became the region ' s rail center again . this renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and interstate highway system became more popular than passenger rails . the decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas .
during the american civil rights movement in the 1960s , meridian was home to a council of < unk > < unk > ( < unk > ) office and several other activist organizations . james < unk > and other local residents , along with michael < unk > , his wife rita , and andrew goodman , volunteers from the north , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare african americans in the area to regain the power to vote . whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . in june 1964 , < unk > , < unk > , and goodman went to < unk > county , mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . the three disappeared that night on their way back to meridian . following a massive fbi investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam .
seven < unk > , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal < unk > in meridian of " < unk > the victims of their civil rights " and three were acquitted in the mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . it was the first time that a white jury had convicted " a white official in a civil rights killing . " in 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time . edgar ray < unk > was convicted of < unk > and sentenced to 60 years in prison . meridian later honored < unk > by renaming a portion of 49th avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service .
starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made < unk > easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . after strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city . the meridian historic < unk > and landmarks commission was created in 1979 , and the meridian main street program was founded in 1985 .
meridian main street organized several projects to < unk > downtown , including the construction of a new amtrak station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during meridian ' s golden age ; it had been demolished . other projects included the renovation of the < unk > building in 2001 and < unk > ' s restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . meridian main street , along with the riley foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic grand opera house in 2006 for use as the " mississippi state university riley center for education and the performing arts . "
after ownership of the meridian main street was transferred to the alliance for downtown meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the meridian downtown association , spearheaded the downtown < unk > effort . the alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . plans were underway to renovate the < unk > building , but newly elected mayor < unk > barry killed the plans in early 2010 . today , the alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . the meridian downtown association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the meridian main street program supports existing businesses downtown .

given meridian ' s site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . even before meridian reached its " golden age , " several large hotels , including the great southern and the grand avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . with the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original union station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . the < unk > hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the terminal hotel was constructed in 1910 . hotel meridian was constructed in 1907 , and union hotel was built in 1908 . union hotel was listed on the national register of historic places in 1979 , and both hotel meridian and grand avenue hotel were listed as contributing properties to the meridian urban center historic district .
as the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @ - @ story skyscraper lamar hotel built in 1927 . listed on the national register of historic places in 1979 , the lamar hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building . in 1988 it was listed as a mississippi landmark .
the < unk > young hotel was built in 1931 . a staple in the african @ - @ american business district that developed west of the city ' s core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling african american could find a room .
as the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . < unk > of the riley center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel . the < unk > building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations . the < unk > preservation society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building ' s renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events .

papa < unk > is one of the shetland islands in scotland , with a population of under twenty people , some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s . located to the west of mainland shetland and with an area of < unk > hectares ( 3 @ . @ 2 square miles ) , papa < unk > is the eighth largest island in shetland . < unk > of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , < unk > , arches , < unk > , and cliffs . the island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife . the west side of the island is a site of special scientific interest and the seas around the island are a special area of conservation .
the island has several neolithic burial chamber sites , as well as the remains of duke < unk > ' s 13th @ - @ century house dating from the norse occupation of the island . the population reached 380 or more in the nineteenth century , when a fishing station was opened at < unk > in west < unk > . subsequently there was a steady decline in population , although the numbers have increased from a low of 16 in the 1970s .
today the main settlement on the island is < unk > , just to the east of which is < unk > < unk > from where the < unk > ferry arrives from its base at west < unk > on the shetland < unk > . < unk > , especially sheep rearing , is the mainstay of island life .

the island is composed of a variety of volcanic and < unk > rock formations from the devonian period . at that time the scottish < unk > formed part of the old red < unk > continent and lay some 10 @ - @ 25 degrees south of the equator . the < unk > of old red < unk > , laid down from < unk > to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier < unk > rocks , < unk > by the formation of < unk > , eroded and then were deposited into river < unk > . the freshwater lake < unk > existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from shetland to the southern moray firth . the structure of papa < unk > is largely made up of ashes and < unk > from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and < unk > ( < unk > ) , but there is also a devonian fish bed at < unk > banks . there are numerous large boulders deposited by pleistocene < unk > .
< unk > of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , < unk > , arches , < unk > , cliffs , < unk > and < unk > that are amongst the finest in britain . the ' holl o < unk > ' is a cave that passes right through the north @ - @ west tip of the island . it is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . < unk > ( or christie ' s ) hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 . yet another is ' < unk > ' s hole ' close to < unk > < unk > in the west . this was the favourite of john tudor who wrote of the island in his victorian memoirs and described the cave as :

human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 bc and there are remains of several neolithic burial chambers known as ' heel @ - @ shaped < unk > ' . little is known of the pre @ - @ celtic and celtic eras , but when the norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from < unk > < unk > meaning " big island of the < unk > " ( celtic monks ) , in distinction to papa little some 12 kilometres ( 7 @ . @ 5 mi ) to the west .

papa < unk > is the subject of a < unk > manuscript written in old norse , which is the oldest surviving document from shetland . it deals with a dramatic incident in the house of duke < unk > < unk > , who was later to become king < unk > v of norway . there is a circle of stones near the beach at < unk > < unk > , which are the remains of a ' < unk > ' , or local assembly . this was the scene of a duel , fought and won by lord < unk > < unk > , who was accused of corruption in the < unk > document and was later called ‘ < unk > de < unk > ’ .

in < unk > shetland came under nominal scottish control , although the norse ' < unk > of norway ' kept their papa < unk > estates until the 17th century . in the 16th century merchants from < unk > and hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . by the 18th century , two scottish < unk > , thomas < unk > of < unk > , and arthur < unk > of < unk > , owned the island . they maintained a prosperous < unk > ( old norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @ - @ < unk > boats known as < unk > .
in addition to the < unk > colony on < unk > < unk > there may have been another at < unk > < unk > overlooking < unk > < unk > . a recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony .
the island church , which < unk > kirk sand in the bay of fore < unk > , was founded in 1806 . 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of < unk > or < unk > on the headland between the west end of kirk sand and the bay of < unk > . it is called the ' < unk > < unk > ' by locals and referred to by the ordnance survey as " the site of a < unk > chapel belonging to about the twelfth century " . there is a tradition that the work there was < unk > with by supernatural powers and that each day ' s work on the building was destroyed during the night . eventually the < unk > were moved overnight by these < unk > agencies to the present site of the church and work was re @ - @ commenced there successfully . excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of < unk > and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it .
in the 19th century the < unk > fishing station in west < unk > was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more . however , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam < unk > saw a fall in population from the 1870s on . at this time another duel entered the history of papa < unk > . edwin lindsay , an indian army officer and the son of the 6th earl of < unk > , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . he spent 26 years as a prisoner before the quaker preacher catherine watson arranged for his release in 1835 . lindsay ' s well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe .
there are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as norse or < unk > mills , around dutch loch . originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @ - @ stone was sited . inside the building there was a fixed lower < unk > , and a rotating upper < unk > driven by the water falling onto the < unk > below . some were still in use on papa < unk > in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the burn of < unk > , at < unk > in the south < unk > of shetland .

in common with many small scottish islands , papa < unk > ' s population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e . g . < unk > ) . by 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in exchange and mart reversed the decline . a < unk > and five sheep were offered free of charge to < unk > which brought a flood of applicants . by 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 . however , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious < unk > between < unk > led to several court cases . a number of people left the island and the school closed . by early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . the 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @ - @ 11 scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @ , @ 702 .

" angel of death " is the opening track on the american thrash metal band slayer ' s 1986 album reign in blood . the lyrics and music were written by slayer guitarist , jeff hanneman and are based on nazi physician < unk > < unk > , who conducted human experiments at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii . " angel of death " led to the band facing accusations of nazi < unk > and racism throughout their career .
despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of reign in blood , " angel of death " is featured on all of slayer ' s live albums and dvds and has appeared in several movies . the song was well received by critics ; steve huey of allmusic described it as a " classic " .

slayer guitarist jeff hanneman wrote " angel of death " after reading books about nazi physician < unk > < unk > while on tour with the band : " i remember stopping < unk > where i bought two books on < unk > . i thought , ' this has gotta be some sick shit . ' so when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that ' s where the lyrics to ' angel of death ' came from . "
the lyrics detail < unk > ' s surgical experiments on patients at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii . < unk > ' s < unk > were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations . among the tests he performed that are mentioned in " angel of death " are experimental < unk > performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , < unk > , < unk > with lethal < unk > , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and < unk > .
" < unk > together , joining heads . just a matter of time ' < unk > you rip < unk > apart " , a line from the penultimate verse , is a reference to the allegation < unk > < unk > together twins , one of them deformed ; " the < unk > was < unk > to the other child , back to back , their wrists back to back too . " this claim was first made by auschwitz survivor < unk > alexander at the 1961 trial of ss @ - @ < unk > adolf < unk > the " architect of the holocaust " , where it was asserted that < unk > " < unk > the veins together " and turned " them into < unk > twins .

the lyrical content of " angel of death " contributed to the delay of the release of slayer ' s 1986 album reign in blood . the band were signed to def jam records whose distributor , columbia records , refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns , deeming the artwork " too graphic " . reign in blood was eventually distributed by geffen records on october 7 , 1986 . however , due to the controversy , reign in blood did not appear on geffen records official release schedule .
" angel of death " caused outrage among survivors of the holocaust , as well as their families and the general public . the controversy led to accusations of nazi < unk > which have followed slayer throughout their career . people took hanneman ' s interest in nazi history and his collection of nazi medals as evidence of < unk > – his most prized item being a german knight ' s cross . hanneman < unk > asserting :
" i know why people < unk > it – it ' s because they get this knee – < unk > reaction to it . when they read the lyrics , there ' s nothing i put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me – well , isn ' t that obvious ? i shouldn ' t have to tell you that . "
according to guitarist kerry king : " yeah , ' slayer are nazis , fascists , communists ' — all that fun shit . and of course we got the most < unk > for it in germany . i was always like , ' read the lyrics and tell me what ' s offensive about it . can you see it as a documentary , or do you think slayer ' s preaching fucking world war ii ? ' people get this thought in their heads — especially in europe — and you ' ll never talk them out of it . "
the song drew accusations of racism , which the band has denied . the band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews , and have stated numerous times that they do not < unk > racism and are merely interested in the subject .
in 2006 , the song " < unk > " from slayer ' s 2006 album christ illusion drew comparison to " angel of death " . " < unk > " deals with the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , and tells the story from a terrorist ' s perspective . < unk > araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of " angel of death " , although it did not < unk > , in part , he believes , due to peoples ' view that the song is " just slayer being slayer " .

" the < unk > blues " is a blues song by american folk and blues musician , lead < unk > . it was written in june 1937 in response to the discrimination and segregation that lead < unk > faced during a visit to washington , dc to record for alan < unk > . it rails against racism , the jim crow laws , and the conditions of contemporary african americans in the southern united states .
the song was recorded in december 1938 for the library of congress and re @ - @ recorded in 1939 for commercial release . it has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including pete seeger , < unk > < unk > , hans < unk > , and billy bragg .

most music historians date the writing of " the < unk > blues " to lead < unk > ' s june 1937 trip to washington , dc , when he was invited by the < unk > alan < unk > to record for the library of congress ' s folk music collection . on the first night lead < unk > and his wife martha spent in the city , they encountered racially < unk > jim crow laws similar to those found in their native louisiana : most hotels refused to rent rooms to african americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man ( < unk > ) . < unk > , in some versions of the story described as an unnamed " white friend " , offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the supreme court building . the next morning , lead < unk > < unk > to < unk > arguing with his < unk > about the presence of a black man , with the < unk > threatening to call the police .
while in washington , lead < unk > encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the < unk > of the song . for instance , when lead < unk > , < unk > , and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together , they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them . lead < unk > was told that if he returned later without < unk > , he would be served .
in response to one of these incidents , a friend of lead < unk > ' s , variously identified as either < unk > or mary elizabeth < unk > joked that washington was a " < unk > town . " though lead < unk > did not know what the word " < unk > " meant , he was fascinated by the sound of it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip . the song came together quickly ; one account claims that it only took a few hours for lead < unk > to write it . < unk > liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment .

" the < unk > blues " is a blues @ - @ style protest song that criticizes the culture of washington , dc . it protests against both the city ' s jim crow laws and the racism of its white population . its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to " spread the news all around " about the racial issues < unk > the city . the song , particularly in the refrain , < unk > race and economics by referring to < unk > as " < unk > " .
the first two verses speak of the segregation that lead < unk > encountered in washington dc : the first recounts the fact that during the trip , lead < unk > was " turned down " wherever he tried to get served due to his race , while the second recounts the argument between < unk > and his < unk > over lead < unk > staying in his apartment . the third verse < unk > cites " the home of the brave , the land of the free " , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in washington , dc . the fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song ' s end , which suggests that african americans boycott buying homes in the district .
the song ' s tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters ; despite this , by " spreading the news " of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern african americans and northern whites that the status < unk > is deeply flawed and that something needs to change .
" the < unk > blues " follows a traditional twelve @ - @ bar blues format . it is written in 44 time but < unk > to note that the song < unk > should swing at medium < unk > . the song was written in b ♭ . it uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating , followed by the final two verses and a < unk > .

the song has been covered and < unk > by a variety of artists including pete seeger and hans < unk > . seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums . in australia , the song was reworked as " canberra blues " by the < unk > < unk > , an r & b band . the lyrics speak of the problems faced by young australians in the australian capital territory in the 1960s . < unk > adapted the song to his style of european blues for the album journey on in 1997 .
in 2006 , billy bragg reworked the song as " bush war blues " . bragg ' s cover is a topical protest song about the iraq war . in one verse , bragg claims that the iraq war was not for democracy but instead was to " make the world safe for < unk > " . in another , he takes on the christian right , asking where the < unk > are . finally , bragg < unk > the united states government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war .

" the < unk > blues " is one of lead < unk > ' s most famous songs and is remembered as his most " heartfelt protest song " . there is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance . robert < unk > claims that the song is " peripheral " to the wider study of the blues , while lawson points to it as a watershed in the way african americans see themselves in the fabric of the united states . there is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics . after its release , it became popular with left @ - @ wing political groups . lead < unk > was invited to perform at camp unity , the communist party usa ' s summer retreat , and the fbi subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s . this led to the accusations that the communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform . the party claims , to the contrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform .
jeff todd < unk > and several other writers have suggested that lead < unk > had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song . this theory stems from the idea that lead < unk > did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by < unk > . since the music that < unk > recorded was sold to < unk > sympathetic to civil rights , it has been suggested that < unk > helped him write a song attractive to a white audience . lead < unk > admitted that the term " < unk > " was unfamiliar to him , and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work .

" < unk > " was one of the first tracks developed for confessions on a dance < unk > , along with " < unk > up " and " future lovers " . it was also the one which took the most time to finish because madonna " thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right . " the songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind . madonna commented that , " whenever i make records , i often like the remixes better than the original ones . [ . . . ] so i thought , screw that . i ' m going to start from that perspective " . she promoted the album at the dance party " < unk > " held at luke & < unk > ' s nightclub in greenwich village , invited by junior < unk > to take over the dj booth where she mixed " < unk > up " with " < unk > " . musically , " < unk > " is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus . it is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of 132 beats per minute . < unk > in the key of c minor , madonna ' s vocal range spans from < unk > to < unk > . it follows the chord progression of e ♭ – < unk > – a ♭ – b ♭ during the spoken introduction . it then changes to < unk > – < unk > @ - @ < unk > in the chorus , while continuing in a ♭ – < unk > – a ♭ – < unk > in the intermediate verses , ultimately ending in repeated lines of " i ' ve heard it all before " .
lyrically the song has < unk > of different languages including french , spanish , italian , dutch , hebrew , hindi , polish and japanese . the song talks about personal < unk > and self @ - @ < unk > , denoting a shift in focus of madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like " everybody " ( 1982 ) , " vogue " ( 1990 ) or " music " ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself . among the various remixes , the pet shop boys remix incorporated whitney houston ' s " i wanna dance with somebody ( who loves me ) " with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction . pet shop boys and madonna had always mutually admired each other , from the time they wrote the song " heart " ( 1988 ) for madonna but never delivered it . the remix had added lyrics sung by band member neil tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album < unk > four . madonna ' s voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook . a breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends , leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends .

= high five interchange =
the high five interchange is one of the first five @ - @ level stack interchanges built in dallas , texas . located at the junction of the lyndon b . johnson freeway ( interstate 635 , i @ - @ 635 ) and the central expressway ( us highway 75 , us 75 ) , it replaces an < unk > partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the 1960s .
the $ 261 million project was started in 2002 and completed in december 2005 . it was designed by the < unk > corporation and built by < unk > construction corporation .
the interchange is considered by popular < unk > to be one of " the world ' s 18 < unk > < unk > " because of its height ( as high as a 12 @ - @ story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features . in 2006 , the american public works association named the high five interchange as " public works < unk > of the year " .
= = description = =
the high five interchange , north of downtown in dallas , texas , is a massive five @ - @ level freeway interchange . it is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the lyndon b . johnson freeway ( interstate 635 ) and the central expressway ( us 75 ) , and is the first five @ - @ level stack interchange to be built in the city .
it replaces the < unk > three @ - @ level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing us 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways . the looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic . left @ - @ hand exits contributed to the congestion . further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult .
< unk > to the celebratory gesture , the " high five " name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @ - @ turn movements that tower over the landscape . the interchange is as high as a 12 @ - @ story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the " high five " ) , 710 support tiers , and 60 miles of additional highway . the highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground . the lanes of us 75 , which are on the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top as part of the project , i @ - @ 635 was widened to include four dedicated high @ - @ occupancy vehicle lanes ( < unk > lanes ) that are barrier @ - @ separated and < unk > .
the roads on the five levels are :
level i : us 75 , an eight lane highway , four lanes going each way
level ii : the junction of the two six @ - @ lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left @ - @ turn lanes and < unk > , and easy access to us 75 and i @ - @ 635
level iii : i @ - @ 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four < unk > lanes ( two going each way ) separated by barriers
level iv and v : direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf
the interchange , with its decorative < unk > on < unk > concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the texas department of transportation ( < unk > ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art . the high five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the < unk > trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange . the section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the high five project by < unk > .
the interchange is considered by popular < unk > as one of " the world ' s 18 < unk > < unk > " , calling it a " labyrinth of lanes " and a " five @ - @ level < unk > of engineering " because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features .
= = history = =
the high five interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , < unk > interchange that accommodated 500 @ , @ 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in dallas . it was a collaborative project between the < unk > , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , < unk > construction . an essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible .
reasons for upgrading the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access .
< unk > construction corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by < unk > , the largest ever by that agency . the construction contract for the high five interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts . for example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete ' s strength ( the first time < unk > had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a < unk > scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years . also built into the construction contract was a provision that < unk > was charged for " lane rentals " by < unk > for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on < unk > assessments and the time of day the lane was closed . the fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @ , @ 000 for rush hours . in order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and < unk > so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished .
to save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed : the original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct @ - @ connect roads ) to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @ - @ in @ - @ place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans . however , < unk > decided to use < unk > concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by deal < unk > of italy and costing about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place .
during the construction , 2 @ . @ 2 million cubic yards of < unk > was used , 350 @ , @ 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 300 @ , @ 000 square feet of retaining walls were built . additionally , 40 @ , @ 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 @ , @ 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed . in addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in 2 @ . @ 3 million square feet of bridge deck .
the project was designed by the < unk > corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun in 2002 and was completed in december 2005 , more than 13 months sooner than planned .
= = awards = =
in 2006 , the american public works association named the high five " public works project of the year " for its massive size , its innovative design , the complexity and < unk > of its construction and the need it fulfilled for the community . < unk > as the managing agency , < unk > construction corporation as the primary contractor , and < unk > corporation as the primary consultant received the award in recognition of their cooperative alliance in completing the project .

the secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days . at the time , punch stated that richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident , though it is unlikely that richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months . ten days after his death , on august 23 , the richmond family held a press conference to reveal that richmond died from complications from aids , which he acquired from an unknown woman . richmond ' s physician , dr . david dodson , said : " there ' s no way of knowing who that woman was . tim was a celebrity with a lot of < unk > , a handsome guy . he naturally attracted a lot of women . " punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent hiv testing in the wake of richmond ' s death .

the < unk > creek mountains are a remote , semi @ - @ arid great basin mountain range mostly in southeastern oregon and partially in northern nevada in the united states . the range ' s highest point is < unk > view < unk > , 8 @ , @ < unk > feet ( 2 @ , @ 593 m ) above sea level , in nevada . disaster peak , elevation 7 @ , @ < unk > feet ( 2 @ , @ 372 m ) , is another prominent summit in the nevada portion of the mountains .
the mountains are characteristic of the great basin ' s topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys . < unk > generally north to south , the < unk > creek mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other < unk > , on top of older < unk > rocks . the southern end of the range , however , features many < unk > < unk > . as a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by < unk > and canyons .
most of the range is public land administered by the federal bureau of land management . there is very little human development in the remote region — cattle grazing and < unk > are the primary human uses — but former mines at the < unk > < unk > produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in north america in the 20th century . public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited . < unk > includes large < unk > of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands . sage grouse and mountain < unk > are two bird species native to the range , and common mammals include < unk > and jackrabbits .
despite the area ' s dry climate , a few year @ - @ round streams provide habitat for the rare < unk > < unk > trout . fish populations in the < unk > creek mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century . in the 1980s , the effects of grazing < unk > on riparian zones and the fish led to land @ - @ use conflict . the < unk > creek mountain working group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties . the < unk > met and agreed on changes to land @ - @ use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover .

the < unk > creek mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern oregon and northern nevada , in harney and humboldt counties . the nearest human settlements are the < unk > ranch , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) directly north from the middle of the mountains ; fields , oregon , about 23 miles ( 37 km ) to the northwest ; < unk > , nevada , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the west ; and < unk > , nevada – oregon , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the east . the mountains are about 150 miles ( 240 km ) directly southwest of boise , idaho , and about 190 miles ( 310 km ) northeast of < unk > , nevada .
the range and surrounding non @ - @ mountainous areas cover an area of < unk > square miles ( 2 @ , @ 100 km2 ) . the mountains run 51 miles ( 82 km ) north to south and 36 miles ( 58 km ) east to west . more of the range is in oregon ( 78 % ) than in nevada ( 22 % ) . the highest point in the range is < unk > view < unk > , which is 8 @ , @ < unk > feet ( 2 @ , @ 593 m ) above sea level and is located in nevada about one mile south of the oregon border . about two miles southeast of < unk > view is disaster peak , " a large , symmetrical < unk > that is visible throughout the region . " at 7 @ , @ < unk > feet ( 2 @ , @ 372 m ) , disaster peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub @ - @ range called the < unk > .
the oregon canyon mountains border the < unk > creek mountains on the east along the harney – < unk > county line ( according to the united states geological survey ' s definitions ) , while the < unk > mountains are the next range west of the < unk > creek mountains . the < unk > creek mountains in both oregon and nevada border the < unk > creek mountains on the southwest ; the two ranges are separated by < unk > cabin creek and south fork < unk > creek . south of the < unk > creek mountains is the kings river valley , which separates the < unk > creek mountains on the west from the montana mountains on the east .
the terrain in the < unk > creek mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock < unk > cut by deep canyons . the canyons have steep walls with loose < unk > slopes at the < unk > . there are meadows around springs in the mountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year @ - @ round . major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include ( from west to east ) < unk > creek , < unk > creek , < unk > creek , and < unk > creek . these streams all flow into < unk > basins in harney county , oregon . < unk > creek and < unk > creek are the largest of the four . the kings river and < unk > creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the < unk > creek mountains . the kings river begins in the < unk > and flows south into nevada , where it meets the quinn river , which < unk > in the black rock desert . < unk > creek begins in oregon a few miles north of the < unk > and flows generally east , crossing the oregon – nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the quinn river valley south of < unk > .

the mountains lie within the basin and range province or great basin of the western united states , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north – south mountain ranges separated by wide , high @ - @ desert valleys . the < unk > creek mountains are < unk > and < unk > blocks with steep < unk > along the southern and eastern sides of the range . the southern area of the range , known as the < unk > , has numerous < unk > of cretaceous age granite . these granite < unk > are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic < unk > .
the < unk > creek mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where < unk > mountain is today . < unk > thinning and the yellowstone < unk > , which was then beneath southeastern oregon , induced eruptions from < unk > and nearby < unk > about 17 million years ago , in the miocene . the < unk > produced a series of < unk > flows that spread across the land now known as the < unk > creek mountains . < unk > from the < unk > volcano lasted for about one million years , and at least 70 separate < unk > flows occurred . under the resulting basalt rock lie much older < unk > rocks that may be related to some of the < unk > age formations of the blue mountains in northeastern oregon . within these < unk > rocks are < unk > and < unk > < unk > bodies which were presumably < unk > during the cretaceous period .
the broad < unk > < unk > is a prominent geologic feature in the < unk > creek mountains . the oval @ - @ shaped < unk > is a collapsed < unk > dome that < unk > the oregon – nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the oregon canyon mountains . it is about 28 miles ( 45 km ) long and 22 miles ( 35 km ) wide . the < unk > dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early miocene . a total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large < unk > dome structure . the < unk > formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago . the < unk > contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the < unk > . other areas in the < unk > were mined for ores of antimony , < unk > , and lithium .
= = climate = =
the < unk > creek mountains are semi @ - @ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west . when moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward over the oregon and california coastal ranges and the cascade range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the < unk > creek mountains . as a result , the average annual precipitation in the < unk > creek mountains is only 8 to 26 inches ( 200 to 660 mm ) per year , with most areas receiving between 8 and 12 inches ( 200 and 300 mm ) annually . much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of march and the end of june . most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months . < unk > at elevations below 6 @ , @ 000 feet ( 1 @ , @ 800 m ) usually < unk > by april ; however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid @ - @ june . local flooding often occurs in the spring as the < unk > < unk > .
the prevailing winds are from the west @ - @ southwest , and they are normally strongest in march and april . < unk > , intense thunderstorms are common between april and october . < unk > in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes .

< unk > in the < unk > creek mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses . other common shrubs include < unk > , snowberry , and < unk > . there are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas . common grass species include idaho < unk > , bluebunch wheatgrass , < unk > , western < unk > , < unk > ' s < unk > , < unk > ' s < unk > , and < unk > < unk > , as well as basin < unk > in some well @ - @ drained areas .
less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian < unk > ( vegetation along stream banks ) . however , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem . the meadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping < unk > or in stream < unk > , and range in size from about 1 to 5 acres ( 0 @ . @ 40 to 2 @ . @ 02 ha ) . < unk > riparian < unk > follow the year @ - @ round streams . many < unk > areas have < unk > < unk > and < unk > groves . < unk > and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is < unk > and stream channels are wider . < unk > and rushes are also native to these stream < unk > . years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young < unk > and < unk > trees . restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s . however , large < unk > in southeastern oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range ' s vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle .

the bureau of land management ( < unk > ) administers most land in the < unk > creek mountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area . the private lands are mainly used for < unk > along mountain streams , while the < unk > lands include large grazing < unk > for local ranchers ' cattle . at least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892 , some of which were staked for gold exploration . commercial mining has occurred in some areas , mostly near the < unk > < unk > , where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted . < unk > in what was called the < unk > < unk > district produced 270 @ , @ 000 < unk > of mercury — " the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere " — from < unk > extracted from the < unk > in the 20th century . the two leading mercury @ - @ producing mines in north america were the < unk > and < unk > mines on the edge of the < unk > in nevada . together , they operated from 1933 to 1989 . the < unk > mine , the last mercury mine in the united states , closed three years later , in 1992 . however , mineral exploration has continued at the < unk > mine in the 21st century , and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of < unk > as part of a u . s . environmental protection agency < unk > project .
the entire mountain range is very remote ; as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness @ - @ like experience . < unk > , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities . the only developed recreation site nearby is at < unk > creek hot springs , just south of the < unk > ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four @ - @ wheel off @ - @ road vehicles . hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , < unk > , < unk > , and rabbits . < unk > on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch @ - @ and @ - @ release basis . the mountains are also suitable for hiking cross @ - @ country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek < unk > . there are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by northern < unk > people as long as 7 @ , @ 000 years ago .
< unk > grazing in the < unk > creek mountains began in the late 19th century , and the < unk > currently < unk > grazing < unk > in the area . < unk > can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months . the effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s .
= = land @ - @ management compromise = =
by the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the < unk > creek mountains and elsewhere in the great basin . as a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . < unk > populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures . these conditions put the rare < unk > < unk > trout population at risk . since the < unk > was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the < unk > creek mountains .
beginning in the early 1970s , the bureau of land management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas . approximately 20 @ , @ 000 < unk > trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing . next , the agency sought to reform land @ - @ use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project .
as environmentalists pressed the < unk > to close much of the < unk > creek mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the < unk > rebellion seeking to protect their grazing < unk > . initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades . however , in 1988 , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the < unk > creek mountain working group . the group ' s goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land ' s ecological health and ranchers ' economic needs .
initial members of the < unk > creek mountain working group included :
over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers . meetings were all open to the public .
the group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well @ - @ being of ranchers . in 1989 , the < unk > ranch agreed to rest two grazing < unk > totaling 50 @ , @ 000 acres ( 20 @ , @ 000 ha ) to restore critical stream < unk > and mountain pastures . the < unk > ' s < unk > on fifteen mile creek was rested for three years , and its < unk > creek pasture received a five @ - @ year rest before grazing was resumed . in addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the < unk > areas was reduced from 3 @ , @ 800 to 2 @ , @ 200 . finally , sensitive areas were < unk > to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams . other < unk > also agreed to rest specific pastures including the < unk > creek , < unk > creek , and < unk > < unk > < unk > .
in 1991 , the bureau of land management approved a new grazing < unk > management plan . it was based on the agreements made by the < unk > creek mountain working group , and it took effect in 1992 . since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the < unk > creek mountains has recovered , and studies by the united states fish and wildlife service have found that the < unk > < unk > trout population , still listed as threatened , is also recovering .

it contains a 16th @ - @ century side chapel with a vault beneath , used as a burial chamber . it is a grade ii listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because it is " a substantially 12th @ - @ century structure " with the " unusual 16th @ - @ century vaulted south chapel " .

the walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century , and the upper parts of the walls date from this time . a chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century . a vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family , the pierce < unk > . in 1999 , the vault was used to record some " atmospheres " for the album " you have just been < unk > by the < unk > " by the < unk > , a collective of welsh musicians including members of echo and the < unk > , super < unk > animals and < unk > that was described by one journalist as " possibly the < unk > pop group of all time " .
for a time , capel < unk > was used as a private place of worship for < unk > house , a " venerable mansion " once owned by the lloyd family which came into the possession of william < unk > , 1st baron boston , in the 18th century . after the early part of the 18th century , however , the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair . the walls remain to gable level , with some traces of render on the inside , but the roof has gone .

capel < unk > has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a grade ii listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . it was given this status on 2 september 1952 and has been listed because it is " important as a substantially 12th @ - @ century structure , with some architectural details surviving from this early period " , even though it is now in a " ruinous condition " . cadw ( which is responsible for the inclusion of welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the " unusual 16th @ - @ century vaulted south chapel " .
the 19th @ - @ century antiquarian < unk > < unk > mentioned the church in her history of anglesey . she said that the architecture was of " the < unk > kind , [ which ] bears testimony to its great antiquity . " she recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins , and when it was dug out , the vault was discovered , " containing several human skeletons , which < unk > into dust , when exposed to the air " . she added that further exploration of the vault then revealed " a large mass of human bones , several feet in depth " .
a 1990 book about abandoned churches in wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of anglesey , and calls capel < unk > a " medieval gesture of christian power in a land so obviously < unk > with the spirit of a pagan past " . it notes that " the wheel has turned full circle and capel < unk > today is just another ruined relic of a former age . " the authors describe the chapel as a " simple , square building " with a " small and < unk > austere south chapel " , adding that the stone slabs over the vault are " almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape .

< unk > < unk > b ( abbreviated < unk > < unk > b , < unk > and b ) , occasionally designated < unk > < unk > < unk > ( to distinguish it from the red dwarf < unk > < unk > b ) , also named < unk > , is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light @ - @ years away from the sun in the constellation of < unk > . the planet orbits the solar twin star , < unk > < unk > a , approximately every five days . discovered in june 1996 by geoffrey < unk > and r . paul butler , it was one of the first hot jupiters to be discovered . it is also one of the first non @ - @ resolved planets to be detected directly . < unk > < unk > b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system .
in july 2014 the international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . the process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . in december 2015 , the iau announced the winning name was < unk > for this planet . the winning name was submitted by the vega < unk > club of morocco and honours the 11th century astronomer ibn al @ - @ < unk > of muslim spain .
= = discovery = =
like the majority of known extrasolar planets , < unk > < unk > b was detected by the variations in its star ' s radial velocity caused by the planet ' s gravity . the variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the < unk > shift of < unk > < unk > ' s spectrum . the planet ' s existence was announced in january 1997 , together with 55 < unk > b and the planet orbiting < unk > < unk > .
like 51 < unk > b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , < unk > < unk > b orbits very close to its star , closer than mercury does to our sun . the planet takes 4 @ . @ < unk > days to complete an orbit , with a < unk > axis of 0 @ . @ < unk > au .
a limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect < unk > < unk > b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found . in the case of < unk > < unk > b , this lower limit is 68 @ . @ 7 % of the mass of jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater . however , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 ° and the true mass may be about 1 @ . @ 4 mj . < unk > is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees .

given the planet ' s high mass , it is likely that < unk > < unk > b is a gas giant with no solid surface .
the < unk > space telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the two sides of < unk > < unk > b of about 1 @ , @ 400 degrees < unk > , ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1 @ , @ 400 to 1 @ , @ 650 degrees < unk > . the temperature difference has led to speculation that < unk > < unk > b is < unk > locked with the same side always facing < unk > < unk > a .
< unk > had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted < unk > < unk > b to have reflective clouds of < unk > and iron in its upper atmosphere . the cloud deck instead absorbs the sun ' s radiation ; between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a < unk > of cooler gas . the outer shell of dark , < unk > , hot cloud is assumed to consist of < unk > and < unk > oxides ( " < unk > planets " ) , but other compounds like < unk > cannot be ruled out yet .
the planet is unlikely to have large moons , since < unk > forces would either < unk > them from orbit or destroy them on short < unk > compared to the age of the system .
the planet ( with 51 < unk > b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by < unk > . preliminary results from < unk > studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is 1 @ . @ 36 times as large and 0 @ . @ 74 times as massive as jupiter , meaning that the mean density is < unk > / cm3 . it has a < unk > albedo of 0 @ . @ 35 in visible light .

< unk > < unk > b appears to be responsible for increased < unk > activity on its parent star . observations suggest that there is a " hot spot " on the star around 169 ° away from the sub @ - @ planetary point . this may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star . the mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of < unk > < unk > < unk > variable stars , or the interaction between jupiter and its moon io .

= = history = =
the current route was originally legislated in 1911 as part of the delaware river drive , a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the delaware river from < unk > to the new york border in < unk > township . route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from < unk > to newark . the original route ran from downtown < unk > along state street and < unk > drive . from there , it followed its current alignment to < unk > , where it followed present @ - @ day route 179 to < unk > to present @ - @ day county route < unk > , which it followed to woods tavern . the route turned north on u . s . route 206 ( also designated route 31 ) and followed that route to < unk > , where it followed u . s . route 22 to newark . the current alignment of route 29 from < unk > to route 12 in frenchtown was designated route < unk > in 1927 .
the alignment of route 29 between < unk > and < unk > was eventually shifted to follow present @ - @ day u . s . route 202 , which was also route 30 ( now route 31 ) between < unk > and flemington and route 12 between flemington and < unk > . in 1938 , route < unk > was planned as an extension of route < unk > from frenchtown to route 28 ( now route 122 ) in alpha . while this road was never built , much of the alignment north of milford is served by county route < unk > . in 1948 , a spur route , route < unk > , was created , running along u . s . route 202 ( bridge street ) in < unk > to the new hope @ - @ < unk > bridge . in the 1953 new jersey state highway renumbering , route 29 was < unk > to continue north from < unk > to frenchtown on route < unk > , and the route 29 designation between < unk > and newark was removed in favor of u . s . route 202 between < unk > and < unk > and u . s . route 22 between < unk > and newark . the section of former route 29 between route < unk > and route < unk > became route 165 .
plans for a limited @ - @ access route along the route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway was proposed along the delaware river between < unk > and < unk > ; this proposal never materialized . plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the john fitch parkway , that was to run from hamilton township to interstate 95 in ewing township . this road was built between 1954 and 1957 from south warren street in < unk > to present @ - @ day interstate 95 in ewing township . construction of this portion john fitch parkway took up much of < unk > ’ s available waterfront along the delaware river . the former alignment of route 29 in the northern part of < unk > and in ewing township became route 175 .
between 1990 and 1995 , the route 29 freeway was built between the interstate 195 / interstate 295 interchange and route 129 in hamilton township . a two @ - @ lane street , < unk > road , connected the two freeway sections . plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in < unk > . construction began in 1997 on the route 29 freeway between route 129 and the < unk > @ - @ < unk > railroad bridge . the road was to include two traffic lights at cass street and south warren street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the delaware river . the tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the army corps of engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel . the roof was put in place in october 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on march 2 , 2002 . a restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in november 2002 .
by the 2000s , the state gave the part of route 29 ( south main street ) between route 165 and route 179 in < unk > to the city , and route 29 was rerouted to use all of route 165 and one block of route 179 . prior to this , south main street had been turned one @ - @ way southbound . route 165 , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with route 29 .

the arrival of the mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the < unk > as the mongols were intent on finishing off the song . for the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from china to burma and india . the mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by < unk > @ - @ speaking muslims from central asia , in 37 circuits of the former < unk > kingdom .
= = = decline of pagan = = =
by then , the pagan empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century . the continuous growth of tax @ - @ free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom . the crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges . although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in < unk > – 60 in south < unk > and < unk > ( < unk > ) , the decline continued . on the eve of the < unk > invasions , between one and two @ - @ thirds of upper burma ' s < unk > land had been donated to religion . the crown ' s ability to < unk > defenses was in serious jeopardy .

the period of calm for pagan ended in the early < unk > . by then , the song were on the ropes , and emperor < unk > khan , who officially founded the yuan dynasty on 18 december 1271 , sought to cut off the retreat of song refugees in all directions . in pagan ' s case , he had ordered the < unk > governor of < unk > to < unk > control of the < unk > , and in january 1271 to send a mission to pagan to demand tribute . the tribute he demanded was nominal . given his higher priority < unk > elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at pagan . at the border , the ruler of the < unk > and < unk > regions submitted to the mongols .
when the < unk > envoys led by < unk > < unk > showed up , the pagan court led by chief minister < unk > < unk > was well aware of the military power of the mongols and advised king < unk > to use diplomacy . the king was furious at the demand and kept the < unk > envoys waiting for weeks . the court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king . < unk > them was a < unk > envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the < unk > king ' s wish to one day worship a buddha tooth at beijing . the king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious < unk > regions in april < unk > . the rebel leader a @ - @ < unk > ( < unk > ) was brought back to pagan . < unk > relayed the news to beijing but did not carry out any military action .
= = = second < unk > mission ( < unk > ) = = =
at beijing , < unk > khan , who was preparing an invasion of japan , decided against a war with pagan — for the time being . on 3 march < unk > , he sent a 4 @ - @ member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the first secretary to the board < unk > , to pagan . the delegation carried a letter from the emperor . the letter says :
" if you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the all @ - @ highest , send one of your brothers or senior ministers , to show men that all the world is linked with us , and enter into a perpetual alliance . this will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests ; for if it comes to war , who will be the victor ? < unk > well , o king , our words . "
this time , the < unk > king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit . ( the < unk > chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed . but both < unk > < unk > evidence and yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed . ) at any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to < unk > in due time . the newly formed < unk > government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route .

meanwhile , in < unk > , the former < unk > kingdom was officially reorganized as the province of < unk > , with < unk > < unk > < unk > al @ - @ din omar as governor . in may 1275 , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned ; that the < unk > evidently had no intention of submitting ; and that war was the only way forward .
but the emperor rejected an outright invasion . just coming off a disastrous japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair . he was now focused on delivering the final blow against the song ; the emperor ordered the < unk > provincial army to secure the < unk > in order to block the escape path of the song refugees . he also sanctioned a limited border war if pagan contested the takeover . as planned , the < unk > army proceeded to consolidate the < unk > in 1275 – 76 . ( elsewhere , the main < unk > armies had captured most of the song territory by < unk > . )
by < unk > , at least one < unk > vassal state named " gold < unk > " ( modern < unk > ) had submitted to the mongols . like in < unk > , the < unk > government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state ; but unlike in < unk > , the mongols had posted a sizable garrison there . though it was ultimately under < unk > command , many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were < unk > @ - @ speaking peoples or people from the further west : turks from < unk > , < unk > , < unk > and < unk > , but also captive soldiers from the persian < unk > empire , the < unk > , and even < unk > from the lower < unk > .

what followed was a border war in < unk > – 78 . it was reported mainly in the yuan dynasty chronicle and the < unk > of marco polo . although the < unk > chronicles have no record of the border war , a < unk > < unk > inscription mentions the army ' s defeat at < unk > . the < unk > accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate .

according to the yuan dynasty chronicle and marco polo ' s accounts , a < unk > army " invaded " the < unk > territory of gold < unk > , and was defeated by the < unk > army in april < unk > . the battle took place either at the < unk > valley ( in present @ - @ day < unk > prefecture ) or 110 km southwest at < unk > ( present @ - @ day < unk > , < unk > prefecture ) , which the < unk > called < unk > .
the yuan chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a < unk > army of 40 @ , @ 000 to 50 @ , @ 000 with 10 @ , @ 000 horses and 800 < unk > . it also reports only one < unk > was killed , in trying to catch an elephant . according to marco polo , the < unk > army consisted of 12 @ , @ 000 mounted < unk > , and the < unk > army numbered 60 @ , @ 000 men with 2000 < unk > , " on each of which was set a tower of timber , well @ - @ framed and strong , and carrying from 12 to 16 well @ - @ armed fighting men .

according to marco polo ' s account , in the early stages of the battle , the turkish and < unk > horsemen " took such < unk > at the sight of the < unk > that they would not be got to face the < unk > , but always < unk > and turned back , " while the < unk > forces pressed on . but the < unk > commander < unk > did not panic ; he ordered his troops to < unk > , and from the cover of the nearby < unk > , aim their bows directly at the advancing < unk > . the < unk > < unk > ' arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled .

despite the < unk > military success , the control of the < unk > remained contested . pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions , and the < unk > , apparently taking advantage of < unk > < unk > elsewhere , rebuilt their forts at < unk > and < unk > later in < unk > , posting permanent garrisons commanded by < unk > < unk > . but their control was short @ - @ lived . the great khan ' s attention turned to southeast asia once more in 1281 . he had had mixed success : his < unk > forces had finished off the last of the song in 1279 but had again failed to take japan in 1281 . that year , the < unk > emperor sent another mission to pagan , demanding tribute yet again . the < unk > king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor ' s court . ( with < unk > , the emperor summoned the king of < unk > himself to beijing . )
at pagan , < unk > < unk > with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit . the < unk > court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern burma . ( he also ordered an invasion of < unk > , whose king too had refused to submit . ) the < unk > king ' s troubles did not go < unk > elsewhere in the kingdom . in the same year , a < unk > named < unk > seized the southern port city of < unk > ( < unk > ) by killing its pagan @ - @ appointed governor . although the king ' s three sons were < unk > of the nearby lower burma cities ( in < unk > ( < unk > ) , < unk > ( < unk > ) , and < unk > ) , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not ( or could not ) take any action on < unk > .
throughout < unk > , the < unk > command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of < unk > and northern burma . the objective of the burma campaign was to take over northern burma but no further ; the emperor did not < unk > an attack on pagan itself . at least one army consisted of 14 @ , @ 000 men of the < unk > persian < unk > empire under the command of < unk > < unk > was sent to < unk > to reinforce the burma invasion force , which again was made up of turks and other central < unk > . on the < unk > side , the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals , he probably could not have raised a large one . by mid @ - @ < unk > , a < unk > army led by generals < unk > < unk > and < unk > < unk > was deployed at a fort at < unk > .

the defeat at < unk > broke the back of < unk > defenses . the < unk > army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders . < unk > , the next fort < unk > , fell just six days later on 9 december < unk > . the < unk > sources say that the < unk > lost 10 @ , @ 000 men at < unk > . the < unk > armies pushed farther south into the < unk > valley . they took the ancient < unk > capital of < unk > , about 380 km north of pagan on 5 february < unk > . there , the invaders paused their advance . they found the heat of the searing < unk > valley excessive , and evacuated < unk > , allowing the < unk > to return to < unk > on 10 may < unk > . but the < unk > army renewed their offensive in the following dry season . they retook < unk > , and defeated another < unk > stand south of < unk > , probably near < unk > , on 26 january < unk > , opening the way to pagan , about 270 km south . after the defeat , the king < unk > , and fled to lower burma . the evacuation proved premature . the < unk > forces did not advance on pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan .
the country fell into chaos . in lower burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack . although his sons ruled the key lower burma ports ( < unk > , < unk > and < unk > ) , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at < unk > , west of < unk > . without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one . the governor of < unk > < unk > that same year . the king managed to send two small expeditions to < unk > but they both failed . now , the entire eastern half of lower burma ( < unk > and < unk > ) was in open revolt .

given his precarious position , < unk > decided to buy time , and sue for peace with the mongols . in november / december < unk > , the king ordered his generals < unk > < unk > and < unk > bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations . the < unk > commanders at < unk > , who had organized northern burma as a protectorate named < unk > ( chinese : < unk > ; wade – giles : < unk > @ - @ < unk > ) , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission . they repeated their 1281 demand that the < unk > king send a formal delegation to the emperor . the two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 march < unk > , which calls for a full submission of the pagan empire , and central burma to be organized as the province of < unk > ( chinese : < unk > ; wade – giles : < unk > @ - @ chung ) . after a long < unk > , the king agreed to submit but wanted the < unk > troops to withdraw . in june < unk > , he sent an embassy led by shin < unk > < unk > , a learned monk , to the emperor ' s court .

in january < unk > , the embassy arrived at beijing , and was received by the yuan emperor . the < unk > delegation formally acknowledged < unk > < unk > of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country . ( indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal . ) in exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops . for the emperor , the burma campaign was the only bright spot ; his other southeast asian expeditions had gone badly . he did not want to invest more troops < unk > the rest of the kingdom . he preferred a vassal ruler . the < unk > embassy arrived back at < unk > in may < unk > , and reported the terms to the king .

but the agreement broke down a month later . in late june , the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for pagan . but on 1 july < unk > , the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son < unk > , the viceroy of < unk > . anarchy ensued . each region in the country which had not < unk > broke away . no successor to < unk > , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of beijing , emerged . indeed , a king would not emerge until may < unk > .

given the chaos , the governor of < unk > ignored the imperial orders of evacuation . the < unk > army commanded by prince < unk > @ - @ sin < unk > , a grandson of the emperor , marched south toward pagan . according to mainstream traditional ( british colonial era ) scholarship , the < unk > army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to pagan with the loss of 7000 men ; occupied the city ; and sent out < unk > to receive homage , one of which reached south of < unk > . but not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary < unk > / chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of pagan or the temporary < unk > of the conquest .
recent research shows that the < unk > forces most probably never reached pagan . they were held at bay by the < unk > defenses led by commanders < unk > , < unk > and < unk > , and probably never got closer than 160 km north of pagan . ( an inscription dated 16 february < unk > by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the < unk > army . ) even if the mongols did reach pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . at any rate , the < unk > army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to < unk > . they remained there as the treaty was now void .
= = aftermath = =
the disintegration of the pagan empire was now complete . but the mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created . they would send no more expeditions to restore order . the emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to < unk > the fragmented country . indeed , his real aim all along may have been " to keep the entire region of southeast asia broken and fragmented . " it would be another two years until one of < unk > ' s sons , < unk > , emerged as king of pagan in may < unk > . but the new " king " controlled just a small area around the capital , and had no real army . the real power in central burma now rested with the three commander brothers .
the uneasy arrangement would persist until < unk > . the mongols continued to occupy northern burma to < unk > as the province of < unk > ( < unk > @ - @ < unk > ) but ended the fictional central burma province of < unk > on 18 august < unk > . meanwhile , the power struggle in central burma continued with the three brothers < unk > consolidating support . to check their rising power , < unk > submitted to the mongols in january < unk > , and was recognized by the yuan emperor < unk > khan as king of pagan on 20 march < unk > . the emperor also gave chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of < unk > . the brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power . on 17 december < unk > , the three brothers < unk > < unk > , and founded the < unk > kingdom . the < unk > forced the < unk > government to intervene again , leading to the second < unk > invasion of burma ( 1300 – 01 ) . the invasion failed . two years later , on 4 april < unk > , the mongols abolished the province of < unk > ( < unk > @ - @ < unk > ) , evacuated < unk > , and returned to < unk > .

the immediate result of the war was the collapse of the pagan empire . however , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it . pagan ' s disintegration was " in fact more prolonged and < unk > . " the kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century . had pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country “ could have risen again ” . but the dynasty could not recover , and because the mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath . as a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century . it was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the < unk > basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy . the vast region surrounding the < unk > valley would continue to be made up of several small tai @ - @ shan states well into the 16th century .

perhaps the most enduring legacy of the < unk > invasions was the emergence of tai @ - @ shan states in mainland southeast asia . the tai @ - @ shan people who came down with the < unk > invasions stayed . by the early 14th century , several tai @ - @ shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present @ - @ day < unk > to northern and eastern < unk > to northern and central thailand and laos . their rise was encouraged by the mongols , who viewed the states as a useful < unk > between < unk > and the rest of southeast asia . the mongols , who were still trying to incorporate < unk > into the central administration , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of < unk > into the fold . ( the integration of < unk > itself into “ china < unk > ” was to take several more centuries , and continues to today . ) as such , from the newly formed tai @ - @ shan states in western and central southeast asia to dai viet and < unk > in eastern southeast asia , the mongols elected to receive nominal tribute . though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the yuan government , they were the native chieftains , “ who would have ruled there in any case , and they did as they pleased . ”

the battle of < unk > ' s ridge , also known as the battle of the bloody ridge , battle of raiders ridge , and battle of the ridge , was a land battle of the pacific campaign of world war ii between imperial japanese army and allied ( mainly united states marine corps ) ground forces . it took place from 12 – 14 september 1942 , on < unk > in the solomon islands , and was the second of three separate major japanese ground offensives during the < unk > campaign .
in the battle , u . s . marines , under the overall command of u . s . major general alexander < unk > , repulsed an attack by the japanese 35th infantry brigade , under the command of japanese major general < unk > < unk > . the marines were defending the < unk > perimeter that guarded henderson field on < unk > , which was captured from the japanese by the allies in landings on < unk > on 7 august 1942 . < unk > ' s unit was sent to < unk > in response to the allied landings with the mission of < unk > the airfield and driving the allied forces from the island .

because of the key participation by < unk > ' s unit in defending the ridge , the ridge was commonly referred to as " < unk > ' s " ridge in historical accounts of the battle in western sources . after < unk > ' s ridge , the japanese continued to send troops to < unk > for further attempts to retake henderson field , affecting japanese offensive operations in other areas of the south pacific .

on 7 august 1942 , allied forces ( primarily u . s . ) landed on < unk > , < unk > , and florida islands in the solomon islands . the landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the u . s . and australia . they were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major japanese base at rabaul and support the allied new guinea campaign . the landings initiated the six @ - @ month @ - @ long < unk > campaign .
taking the japanese by surprise , by nightfall on 8 august the allied landing forces had secured < unk > and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction at < unk > point ( 9 ° 25 ′ 45 ″ s 160 ° 3 ′ 4 ″ e ) on the north shore of the island of < unk > east of the present day capital of < unk > . < unk > placed his 11 @ , @ 000 troops of the 1st marine division on < unk > in a loose perimeter around the < unk > point area .
on 12 august , the airfield was named henderson field after major < unk > henderson , a marine < unk > who had been killed at the battle of midway . the allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of henderson field were called the " < unk > air force " after the allied code name for < unk > .
in response to the allied landings on < unk > , the japanese imperial general headquarters assigned the imperial japanese army ' s 17th army — a corps @ - @ sized command based at rabaul ( 4 ° 11 ′ 56 ″ s 152 ° 9 ′ 57 ″ e ) and under the command of lieutenant @ - @ general < unk > < unk > — with the task of retaking < unk > from allied forces . the 17th army — heavily involved with the japanese campaign in new guinea — had only a few units available to send to the southern < unk > area . of these units , the 35th infantry brigade — under major general < unk > < unk > — was at < unk > , the 4th ( < unk > ) infantry regiment was in the philippines and the 28th ( < unk > ) infantry regiment — under the command of colonel < unk > < unk > — was embarked on transport ships near guam . the different units began to move toward < unk > immediately ; < unk > ' s regiment — the closest — arrived first . the " first < unk > " of < unk > ' s unit — consisting of about < unk > soldiers — landed from destroyers at < unk > point ( 9 ° 24 ′ 38 ″ s 160 ° 20 ′ 56 ″ e ) , about 18 mi ( 29 km ) east of the < unk > perimeter , on august 19 .

by 23 august , < unk > ' s unit had reached < unk > and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to < unk > . because of the damage caused by allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the battle of the eastern < unk > , the japanese decided not to deliver < unk > ' s troops to < unk > by slow transport ship ; instead , the ships carrying < unk > ' s soldiers were sent to rabaul . from there , the japanese planned to deliver < unk > ' s men to < unk > by destroyers , staging through a japanese naval base in the < unk > islands . the japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down " the < unk > " to < unk > and back in a single night , < unk > their exposure to allied air attack . however , most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to < unk > with them . these high @ - @ speed destroyer runs to < unk > , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the " tokyo express " by allied forces and " rat transportation " by the japanese . the japanese controlled the seas around the solomon islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the allies . however , any japanese ship remaining within the 200 mi ( 320 km ) range of the aircraft at henderson field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks . this " curious tactical situation " held for several months .

on 28 august , 600 of < unk > ' s troops were loaded onto the destroyers < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , and < unk > , designated destroyer division 20 ( < unk > ) . because of a shortage of fuel , < unk > could not make the entire round trip to < unk > at high speed in one night , but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which < unk > fuel . at 18 : 05 that day , 11 u . s . dive bombers from < unk > @ - @ 232 under the command of lt . col . richard < unk > , flew from henderson field and located and attacked < unk > about 70 mi ( 110 km ) north of < unk > , sinking < unk > and heavily damaging < unk > and < unk > . < unk > took < unk > in tow and the three destroyers returned to the < unk > without completing their mission . the attack on < unk > killed 62 of < unk > ' s soldiers and 94 crew members .
subsequent " express " runs were more successful . between 29 august and 4 september , various japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost 5 @ , @ 000 troops at < unk > point , including all of the 35th infantry brigade , one battalion of the < unk > regiment , and the rest of < unk > ' s regiment . general < unk > , who landed at < unk > point on the 31 august express run , was placed in command of all the japanese troops on < unk > . on the night of 4 / 5 september , as three of the express destroyers — < unk > , < unk > , and < unk > — prepared to shell henderson field after landing their troops , they detected and sank two u . s . ships in the vicinity , the small , old destroyer transports ( called " < unk > " by the u . s . marines ) uss little and gregory that were used to < unk > allied troops around the < unk > / < unk > area .
in spite of the successes of the destroyer runs , < unk > insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to < unk > by slow barges . therefore , a convoy carrying 1 @ , @ 100 of < unk > ' s troops and heavy equipment in 61 barges , mainly from the 2nd battalion , < unk > infantry regiment under the command of colonel < unk > < unk > , departed the northern coast of santa isabel island on 2 september . on 4 – 5 september , aircraft from henderson field attacked the barge convoy , killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit ' s heavy equipment . most of the remaining 1 @ , @ 000 troops were able to land near < unk > ( 9 ° 15 ′ 32 ″ s 159 ° 40 ′ 18 ″ e ) , west of the < unk > perimeter over the next few days . by 7 september , < unk > had 5 @ , @ 200 troops at < unk > point and 1 @ , @ 000 west of the < unk > perimeter . < unk > was confident enough that he could defeat the allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces . < unk > believed that there were only about 2 @ , @ 000 u . s . marines on < unk > .
during this time , < unk > continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the < unk > perimeter . between 21 august and 3 september , he relocated three marine battalions — including the 1st < unk > battalion , under u . s . lieutenant colonel merritt a . < unk > ( < unk > ' s raiders ) , and the 1st parachute battalion — from < unk > and < unk > to < unk > . these units added about 1 @ , @ 500 troops to < unk > ' s original 11 @ , @ 000 men defending henderson field . the 1st parachute battalion , which had suffered heavy casualties in the battle of < unk > and < unk > @ - @ < unk > in august , was placed under < unk > ' s command .

< unk > set the date for his attack on the < unk > perimeter for 12 september and began marching his forces west from < unk > towards < unk > point on 5 september . he < unk > 17th army and requested that it carry out air strikes on henderson field beginning on 9 september , and that naval warships be stationed off < unk > point on september 12 to " destroy any americans who attempted to flee from the island . " on 7 september , < unk > issued his attack plan to " < unk > and < unk > the enemy in the vicinity of the < unk > island airfield . " < unk > ' s plan called for his forces to split into three , approach the < unk > perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack . < unk > ' s force would attack the perimeter from the west while < unk > ' s second < unk > — renamed the < unk > battalion — would attack from the east . the main attack would be by < unk > ' s " center body " , numbering 3 @ , @ 000 men in three battalions , from the south of the < unk > perimeter . by 7 september , most of < unk > ' s troops had started marching from < unk > towards < unk > point along the coastline . about 250 japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade ' s supply base at < unk > .
meanwhile , native island scouts — directed by british government official and officer in the british solomon islands < unk > defence force , martin < unk > — told the marines of japanese troops at < unk > , near the village of < unk > , about 17 mi ( 27 km ) east of < unk > . < unk > launched a raid against the japanese troops at < unk > . destroyer transports uss mckean and < unk > and two patrol boats took < unk > of < unk > ' s men to < unk > in two trips . < unk > and his first wave of < unk > troops landed at < unk > at 05 : 20 ( local time ) on 8 september . < unk > by aircraft from henderson field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , < unk > ' s men advanced towards < unk > village but were slowed by japanese resistance . at 11 : 00 , the rest of < unk > ' s men landed . with this reinforcement and more support from the henderson field aircraft , < unk > ' s force pushed into the village . the japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an allied supply ship convoy heading towards < unk > point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind 27 dead . two marines were killed .
in < unk > , < unk > ' s troops discovered the supply base for < unk > ' s forces , including large < unk > of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a < unk > radio . the marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the < unk > perimeter at 17 : 30 . the quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3 @ , @ 000 japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack .
< unk > and colonel gerald thomas , < unk > ' s operations officer , believed that the japanese attack would come at the < unk > ridge , a narrow , grassy , 1 @ , @ 000 m ( 1 @ , @ 100 yd ) long , coral ridge ( 9 ° 26 ′ 39 ″ s 160 ° 2 ′ 50 ″ e ) parallel to the < unk > river just south of henderson field . the ridge offered a natural < unk > of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended . < unk > and thomas tried to persuade < unk > to move forces to defend the ridge , but < unk > refused , believing that the japanese were more likely to attack along the coast . finally , thomas convinced < unk > that the ridge was a good location for < unk > ' s raiders to " rest " from their actions of the preceding month . on 11 september , the 840 men of < unk > ' s unit — including the 1st raiders and the < unk > — deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it .
< unk > ' s center body of troops was planning to attack the < unk > perimeter at the ridge , which they called " the < unk > " ( < unk > < unk > ) because of its shape . on 9 september , < unk > ' s troops left the coast at < unk > point . < unk > into four columns , they marched into the jungle towards their < unk > attack points south and southeast of the airfield . < unk > of good maps , at least one faulty < unk > , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the japanese columns to proceed slowly and < unk > , costing a lot of time . at the same time , < unk > ' s troops approached the < unk > perimeter from the west . < unk > had some intelligence on the marine defenses , extracted from a u . s . army pilot captured on 30 august .
during the day of 12 september , < unk > ' s troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night ' s attacks . < unk > wanted his three center body battalions in place by 14 : 00 , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22 : 00 . < unk > was also delayed in his advance towards the marine lines in the west . only the < unk > battalion reported that they were in place on time . despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions , < unk > was still confident in his attack plan because a captured u . s . pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the marine defenses . japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11 – 12 september , causing a few casualties , including two killed .

the americans knew of the approach of the japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack . the ridge around which < unk > deployed his men consisted of three distinct < unk > . at the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was hill 80 ( so named because it rose 80 ft ( 24 m ) above sea level ) . six hundred yards north was hill 123 ( 123 ft ( 37 m ) high ) , the dominant feature on the ridge . the < unk > < unk > was unnamed and about 60 ft ( 18 m ) high . < unk > placed the five companies from the < unk > battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from hill 80 back to hill 123 . two of the five < unk > companies , " b " and " c " , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy < unk > , and the < unk > river . machine @ - @ gun teams from " e " company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses . < unk > placed his command post on hill 123 .
at 21 : 30 on 12 september , the japanese cruiser < unk > and three destroyers shelled the < unk > perimeter for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a < unk > . japanese artillery began shelling the marine lines , but did little damage . at the same time , scattered groups of < unk > ' s troops began < unk > with marines around the ridge . < unk > ' s 1st battalion — led by major < unk > < unk > — attacked the < unk > ' s " c " company between the < unk > and the < unk > river , overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the marine company to fall back to the ridge . < unk > ' s unit became entangled with troops from < unk > ' s 3rd battalion under lieutenant colonel < unk > < unk > , who were still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the japanese attack on the ridge that night . < unk > , who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the u . s . marine lines as well as coordinating his troops ' attacks , later complained , " due to the < unk > jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control . in my whole life i have never felt so disappointed and helpless . " twelve u . s . marines were killed ; japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater . although both < unk > in the west and the < unk > unit in the east tried to attack the marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the marine lines at dawn .
at first light on 13 september , < unk > air force aircraft and marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge , forcing any japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle . the japanese suffered several casualties , including two officers from < unk > ' s battalion . at 05 : 50 , < unk > decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night .
= = = second night ' s action on the ridge = = =
< unk > the japanese to attack again that night , < unk > directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge . after a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the marine right flank lost to < unk > the night before , < unk > < unk > his forces . he pulled his front back about 400 yd ( 370 m ) to a line that stretched 1 @ , @ 800 yd ( 1 @ , @ 600 m ) , starting at the < unk > river and crossing the ridge about 150 yd ( 140 m ) south of hill 123 . around and behind hill 123 he placed five companies . any japanese attackers < unk > hill 80 would have to advance over 400 yd ( 370 m ) of open terrain to close with the marine positions at hill 123 . with only a few hours to prepare , the marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications . they were low on ammunition , with one or two grenades for each marine . < unk > ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd battalion , 5th marine regiment ( 2 / 5 ) to move into a position just to the rear of < unk > ' s troops . in addition , a battery of four < unk > howitzers from the 11th marine regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed with < unk > ' s front line units .
late in the afternoon , < unk > stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops , saying ,
you men have done a great job , and i have just one more thing to ask of you . < unk > out just one more night . i know we ' ve been without sleep a long time . but we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here . i have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning .
< unk > ' s speech " raised the spirits " of the raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead .
as the sun set on 13 september , < unk > faced < unk > ' s 830 marines with 3 @ , @ 000 troops of his brigade , plus an assortment of light artillery . the night was pitch black , with no moon . at 21 : 00 , seven japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge . < unk > ' s attack began just after nightfall , with < unk > ' s battalion assaulting < unk > company b on the marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge . the force of the assault caused company b to fall back to hill 123 . under marine artillery fire , < unk > reassembled his men and continued his attack . without < unk > to try to " roll @ - @ up " the other nearby marine units , whose flanks were now unprotected , < unk > ' s unit < unk > forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the < unk > river , heading for the airfield . < unk > ' s men came upon a pile of marine supplies and rations . not having eaten adequately for a couple of days , they paused to " < unk > themselves " on the " c " and " k " rations . < unk > ordered his men to continue the attack . at about 03 : 00 , he led them against the marine units around the northern portion of the ridge , just short of the airfield , as well as hill 123 . in the heavy fighting that followed , < unk > and around 100 of his men were killed , ending that attack .
meanwhile , < unk > ' s 2nd battalion , under major < unk > tamura , assembled for their planned assault against hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge . marine observers spotted tamura ' s preparations and called in artillery fire . at about 22 : 00 , a barrage from twelve 105 mm ( 4 @ . @ 1 in ) guns hit tamura ' s position . in response , two companies of tamura ' s troops — numbering about 320 men — charged up hill 80 with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades . tamura ' s attack hit company b of the marine parachute battalion and also < unk > company b , pushing the < unk > off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the < unk > . to protect the exposed < unk > company b , < unk > immediately ordered them to pull back onto hill 123 .
at the same time , a japanese company from < unk > ' s battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and parachute company c . < unk > that their positions were now < unk > , parachute companies b and c climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind hill 123 . in the darkness and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized . a few marines began < unk > that the japanese were attacking with poison gas , < unk > other marines who no longer possessed their gas masks . after arriving behind hill 123 , some of the marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word " withdraw " to anyone within < unk > . other marines began to follow them . just at the moment that it appeared that the marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a < unk > , < unk > , major kenneth d . bailey from < unk > ' s staff , and other marine officers appeared and , with " vivid " language , < unk > the marines back into defensive positions around hill 123 .
as the marines formed into a < unk > @ - @ shaped line around hill 123 , tamura ' s battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill , charging up the saddle from hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge . under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one japanese < unk > , the marines repulsed the first two attacks by tamura ' s men . tamura ' s troops < unk > a 75 mm ( 2 @ . @ 95 in ) " regimental " gun to the top of hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the marines . this gun , which " could have turned the tide in favor of the japanese , " however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin . at midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , < unk > ordered parachute companies b and c to advance from behind hill 123 to strengthen his left flank . with fixed bayonets , the < unk > swept forward , killing japanese soldiers who had overrun the marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill . marines from other units , as well as members of < unk > ' s command staff , including major bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the marines around hill 123 , who were running critically low . said marine participant captain william j . < unk > , " the japanese attack was almost constant , like a rain that < unk > for a moment and then < unk > the harder . . . when one wave was < unk > down - and i mean < unk > down - another followed it into death . "
the japanese hit < unk > ' s left flank just after the < unk > took position but were again stopped by marine rifle , machine @ - @ gun , mortar , and grenade fire . marine 105 mm and 75 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking japanese . a captured japanese soldier later said that his unit was " annihilated " by the marine artillery fire , which only 10 % of his company survived .
by 04 : 00 , after < unk > several more assaults , some of which resulted in hand @ - @ to @ - @ hand fighting , and severe sniper fire from all sides , < unk > ' s men were joined by troops from the 2nd battalion , 5th marine regiment , who helped repulse two more japanese attacks before dawn . throughout the night , as < unk > ' s men came close to overrunning the marine defenses , < unk > remained standing about 20 yd ( 18 m ) behind the marine firing line on hill 123 , < unk > his troops and directing their defensive efforts . said marine captain < unk > smith , who was in position to observe < unk > for most of the night , " i can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together , < unk > did it that night . he stood just behind the front lines – stood , when most of us < unk > the ground . "
during the heavy fighting , portions of three japanese companies , including two from tamura ' s and one from < unk > ' s battalions , < unk > the marine defenses on the ridge , while suffering heavy losses from marine gunfire , and reached the edge of " fighter one " , a secondary runway of henderson field . a counterattack by the marine engineers stopped one japanese company ' s advances and forced it to retreat . the other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield . when no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after < unk > . most of the rest of < unk > ' s battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night .
as the sun rose on 14 september , pockets of japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge . but with tamura ' s battalion shattered after losing < unk > of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , < unk > ' s assault on the ridge had effectively ended . about 100 japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of hill 80 , perhaps preparing for one more charge on hill 123 . at first light , three u . s . army aircraft from the 67th fighter squadron at henderson field , acting on a request personally delivered by bailey , < unk > the japanese near hill 80 and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle .
= = = < unk > and < unk > attacks = = =
as the battle on the ridge took place , < unk > ' s < unk > and < unk > units also attacked the marine defenses on the east and west sides of the < unk > perimeter . the < unk > battalion — led by major takeshi < unk > — attacked the southeastern sector of the < unk > perimeter , defended by marines of the 3rd battalion , 1st marine regiment ( 3 / 1 ) . < unk > ' s attack started around midnight , with one company attacking through marine artillery fire and engaging in hand @ - @ to @ - @ hand combat with the marine defenders before being thrown back . < unk > was killed in the attack . after < unk > , the marines , believing that the rest of < unk > ' s battalion was still in the area , sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the marine lines ; four japanese 37 mm ( 1 @ . @ 46 in ) anti @ - @ tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them . after abandoning their burning tanks , several of the disabled tanks ' < unk > were < unk > and killed by the japanese . one tank < unk > down an embankment into the < unk > river , drowning its crew .
at 23 : 00 on 14 september , the remnants of the < unk > battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the marine lines , but were repulsed . a final " weak " attack by the < unk > unit on the evening of 15 september was also defeated .
< unk > ' s unit of about 650 men attacked the marines at several locations on the west side of the < unk > perimeter . at about 04 : 00 on 14 september , two japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd battalion , 5th marine regiment ( 3 / 5 ) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses . another japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 september . the rest of < unk > ' s unit failed to find the marine lines and did not participate in the attack .

at 13 : 05 on 14 september , < unk > led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle , where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day . < unk > ' s units were then ordered to withdraw west to the < unk > river valley to join with < unk > ' s unit , a 6 mi ( 9 @ . @ 7 km ) march over difficult terrain . < unk > ' s troops began the march on the morning of 16 september . almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded . as the march progressed , the exhausted and hungry soldiers , who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal , began to < unk > their heavy equipment and then their rifles . by the time most of them reached < unk > ' s positions at < unk > five days later , only half still carried their weapons . the < unk > battalion ' s survivors , attempting to follow < unk > ' s center body forces , became lost , wandered for three weeks in the jungle , and almost < unk > to death before finally reaching < unk > ' s camp .
in total , < unk > ' s forces lost about 830 killed in the attack , including 350 in tamura ' s battalion , 200 in < unk > ' s battalion , 120 in < unk > ' s force , 100 in the < unk > battalion , and 60 in < unk > ' s battalion . an unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the < unk > . on and around the ridge , the marines counted 500 japanese dead , including 200 on the slopes of hill 123 . the marines suffered 80 killed between 12 and 14 september .
on 17 september , < unk > sent two companies from the 1st battalion , 1st marine regiment ( 1 / 1 ) to pursue the retreating japanese . the marines were ambushed by two japanese companies acting as rear @ - @ guards for the withdrawal , and one marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the marines retreated . the marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by < unk > . by nightfall , the japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon , killing 24 marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving . on 20 september , a patrol from < unk > ' s raiders encountered stragglers from < unk > ' s retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them .
as the japanese regrouped west of the < unk > , the u . s . forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their < unk > defenses . on 14 september , < unk > moved another battalion , the 3rd battalion , 2nd marine regiment ( 3 / 2 ) , from < unk > to < unk > . on 18 september , an allied naval convoy delivered 4 @ , @ 157 men from the 3rd provisional marine brigade ( the u . s . 7th marine regiment augmented by additional support units ) to < unk > . these reinforcements allowed < unk > — beginning on 19 september — to establish an unbroken line of defense around the < unk > perimeter . < unk > ' s forces ' next significant clashes with the japanese occurred along the < unk > river from 23 – 27 september and 6 – 9 october .

on 15 september , general < unk > at rabaul learned of < unk > ' s defeat , the imperial japanese army ' s first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war . the general < unk > the news to the imperial general headquarters in japan . in an emergency session , the top japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that , " < unk > might develop into the decisive battle of the war .

after delivering more forces during the next month the japanese mounted a major ground offensive on < unk > , led by < unk > , in late october 1942 at the battle for henderson field , but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the japanese . < unk > later stated that < unk > ' s assault on the ridge in september was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded , " we would have been in a pretty bad condition .

not far after route 49 , the road crosses the < unk > river into < unk > city , atlantic county . in < unk > city , it heads into residential areas , with cr < unk > < unk > to the west of the route . route 50 and cr < unk > continue northwest and intersect cr 648 , where the road turns north into more forested areas . at the junction with cr 645 , the route turns to the northeast and enters < unk > manor , becoming broad street . cr < unk > splits from route 50 by heading northwest on buena < unk > road and route 50 heads through some agricultural < unk > concurrent with cr < unk > truck , passing to the west of the < unk > wildlife area , which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds . the route intersects cr < unk > , turning to the northeast .
after passing some homes and stephen lake , the road turns to the north and passes to the west of < unk > manor county park . the route crosses the south river into < unk > township , passing the residential community of < unk > to the east and meeting cr < unk > . it soon enters hamilton township , where the name of the road becomes mill street and it comes to a junction with us 40 ( harding highway ) . cr < unk > truck heads to the west on us 40 at this point while route 50 heads east on us 40 , and cr < unk > continues north .
us 40 and < unk > 50 follow the harding highway , a two @ - @ lane undivided road , turning to the northeast and crossing the great < unk > harbor river . upon passing over the river , enters mays landing and turns north , encountering cr < unk > before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of mays landing . here , the road crosses cr < unk > , and us 40 splits from < unk > 50 by turning east along that road . meanwhile , route 50 continues north on cape may avenue , passing through developed areas . it leaves mays landing and heads into back into forests . the route turns to the northeast , passing near the < unk > leaf lakes residential development , before coming to an interchange with us 322 ( black horse pike ) .
past this interchange , route 50 < unk > to a four @ - @ lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the atlantic city expressway . the route becomes a two @ - @ lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas , crossing into galloway township , where there is an intersection with cr < unk > . a short distance later , the road crosses new jersey transit ’ s atlantic city line near the < unk > harbor city station and enters < unk > harbor city , turning into philadelphia avenue . a block after the railroad crossing , route 50 ends at an intersection with us 30 and cr < unk > ( white horse pike ) , with cr < unk > continuing north on philadelphia avenue at this point .

= air rhodesia flight < unk > =
air rhodesia flight < unk > was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the zimbabwe people ' s revolutionary army ( < unk > ) on 3 september 1978 , during the rhodesian bush war . the aircraft involved , a vickers viscount named the < unk > , was flying the last leg of air rhodesia ' s regular scheduled service from victoria falls to the capital salisbury , via the resort town of < unk > .
soon after flight < unk > took off , a group of < unk > guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a soviet @ - @ made < unk > 2 surface @ - @ to @ - @ air infrared < unk > missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing . an attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of < unk > was < unk > by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up . of the 52 passengers and four crew , 38 died in this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire . three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived .
< unk > leader joshua < unk > publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the < unk > in an interview with the bbc ' s today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground . the majority of < unk > , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism . a fierce white rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming < unk > < unk > and suspicious of blacks in general , even though few black < unk > supported attacks of this kind . reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments , much to the rhodesian government ' s < unk > .
< unk > between < unk > and prime minister ian smith , which had been progressing < unk > , were immediately suspended by the furious < unk > , with smith calling < unk > a " monster " . on 10 september , smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas . the rhodesian security forces launched several retaliatory strikes into zambia and mozambique over the following months , attacking both < unk > and its rival , the zimbabwe african national liberation army ( zanla ) . the attack on < unk > in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions . five months later , in february 1979 , < unk > shot down air rhodesia flight < unk > , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident .
= = background = =
a dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self @ - @ governing colony of rhodesia ( or southern rhodesia ) led the colonial government , headed by prime minister ian smith , to < unk > declare independence from the united kingdom on 11 november 1965 . the idea of " no independence before majority rule " had recently gained ground in britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and rhodesia ' s government was dominated by the country ' s white minority , so the unilateral declaration went < unk > internationally . britain and the united nations imposed economic sanctions on rhodesia .
two rival communist @ - @ backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the chinese @ - @ aligned zimbabwe african national union ( < unk > ) , mostly comprising < unk > , created the zimbabwe african national liberation army ( zanla ) and adopted aspects of < unk > doctrine , while the < unk > @ - @ dominated zimbabwe african people ' s union ( < unk > ) , aligned with soviet @ - @ style < unk > – < unk > and the warsaw pact , mobilised the zimbabwe people ' s revolutionary army ( < unk > ) . these guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the " second < unk > " against the rhodesian government and security forces . the resulting conflict , the rhodesian bush war , began in earnest in december 1972 , when zanla attacked < unk > and < unk > < unk > in north @ - @ eastern rhodesia .
after the security forces mounted a successful counter @ - @ insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 , developments overseas caused the conflict ' s momentum to shift in the insurgents ' favour . the leftist carnation revolution of april 1974 caused portugal to withdraw its key economic support for smith ' s administration , and led to mozambique ' s independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with < unk > . around the same time , rhodesia ' s other main < unk > , south africa , adopted a < unk > initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup . following the abortive victoria falls conference of august 1975 , smith and the < unk > leader joshua < unk > held unsuccessful talks between december 1975 and march 1976 . < unk > and < unk > announced in october 1976 , during the run @ - @ up to the unsuccessful geneva conference in december , that they would < unk > attend conferences as a joint " patriotic front " .
in march 1978 , smith and non @ - @ militant nationalist groups headed by bishop < unk > < unk > , the reverend < unk > < unk > and chief jeremiah < unk > agreed what became the " internal settlement " . this created a joint black – white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as zimbabwe rhodesia in june 1979 , pursuant to < unk > elections . < unk > and < unk > were invited to participate , but refused ; < unk > < unk > dubbed smith ' s black colleagues " the blacksmiths " . < unk > proclaimed 1978 to be " the year of the people " as the war continued . officials from < unk > ' s united african national council , sent to the provinces to explain the internal settlement to rural blacks , were killed by marxist – < unk > guerrillas . < unk > also began to target christian missionaries , < unk > in the killing of nine british missionaries and four children at < unk > mission near the mozambican border on 23 june .
the transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the internal settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control . no country recognised rhodesia ' s interim administration . smith again worked to bring < unk > into the government , hoping this would lend it some < unk > domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat zanla . starting on 14 august 1978 , he attended secret meetings with < unk > in < unk > , zambia ( where < unk > was based ) , doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation < unk > . attempts were made to also involve the < unk > leader robert < unk > , but < unk > would have no part in the talks . according to the south african military historian < unk > < unk > , negotiations between smith and < unk > progressed well and " seemed on the verge of success " by the start of september 1978 . on 2 september , smith and < unk > revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place .

air rhodesia was the country ' s national airline , established by the government on 1 september 1967 to succeed central african airways , which was dissolved at the end of that year . based at salisbury airport , air rhodesia ' s flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights , as well as international services to the south african cities of johannesburg and durban .
the flight < unk > aircraft was a vickers viscount < unk > , a british @ - @ made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing . it was named the < unk > after the river of the same name , which flowed between lake < unk > and the rhodesian capital salisbury .

of the 56 people on board , 38 , including hood and beaumont , died in the crash . eighteen survived , albeit with injuries , and climbed out of the wreckage . after briefly settling the others , one of the passengers , dr cecil < unk > , led four others — young < unk > robert and shannon < unk > , mrs sharon < unk > , and her four @ - @ year @ - @ old daughter tracey — off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water . the other 13 remained close to the wreckage . meanwhile , nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it at about 17 : 45 . three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching : rhodesian army < unk > anthony hill , 39 , took cover in the surrounding bush , while businessman hans hansen and his wife diana did the same . this left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage , including four women and two girls ( aged 11 and 4 ) .
the guerrillas , who were armed with ak @ - @ 47 rifles , presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water . they spoke in english , both to the survivors and among themselves . they told the passengers to < unk > around a point a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able @ - @ bodied men to carry the others . the passengers were assembled into an area of about 10 square metres ( 110 sq ft ) . standing roughly 15 metres ( 49 ft ) away , the cadres now raised their weapons . " you have taken our land , " one of them said . " please don ' t shoot us ! " one of the passengers cried , just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire .
having collected water from the nearby village , < unk > and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots . < unk > it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat , they continued on their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still alive . this alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors ; one of the guerrillas told < unk > ' s group to " come here " . the insurgents then opened fire on their general location , prompting < unk > and the others to flee . hill and the < unk > also ran ; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their < unk > , but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge . after hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19 : 45 . the guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the < unk > < unk > around the site , filled their arms with various passengers ' belongings , then left again .

the rhodesian attacks on zanla and < unk > bases did much to restore white morale following the viscount incident , though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns . < unk > and the < unk > president kenneth < unk > all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the soviets and the british respectively . martial law was quickly extended across rhodesia ' s rural areas , and covered three @ - @ quarters of the country by the end of 1978 . air rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti @ - @ < unk > shielding for its < unk > . before this work was completed , < unk > shot down a second viscount , air rhodesia flight < unk > , on 12 february 1979 . this time there were no survivors .

the closest large modern settlements are flores and santa < unk > , approximately 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) by road to the southwest . < unk > is approximately < unk > kilometres ( 188 mi ) north of guatemala city . it is 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south of the contemporary maya city of < unk > and 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northwest of < unk > . the city was located 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) southeast of its great classic period rival , < unk > , and 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) northwest of < unk > ' s ally < unk > , now in belize .
the city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than 16 square kilometres ( 6 @ . @ 2 sq mi ) that included about 3 @ , @ 000 structures . the topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands . the major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised < unk > spanning the swamps . the area around < unk > has been declared as the < unk > national park and the preserved area covers 570 square kilometres ( 220 sq mi ) .
the ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern guatemala that formed the < unk > of lowland maya civilization . the city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east – west trade route across the < unk > peninsula . < unk > trees at the < unk > park include gigantic < unk > ( < unk > < unk > ) the sacred tree of the maya ; tropical cedar ( < unk > < unk > ) , and honduras mahogany ( < unk > < unk > ) . regarding the fauna , < unk > , white @ - @ < unk > < unk > , gray foxes , < unk > ' s spider monkeys , < unk > monkeys , < unk > eagles , falcons , < unk > < unk > , < unk > , < unk > , green parrots and < unk > ants can be seen there regularly . < unk > , < unk > , and cougars are also said to < unk > in the park . for centuries this city was completely covered under jungle . the average annual rainfall at < unk > is 1 @ , @ < unk > millimetres ( 76 @ . @ 6 in ) .
one of the largest of the classic maya cities , < unk > had no water other than what was collected from < unk > and stored in ten reservoirs . archaeologists working in < unk > during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use .
the < unk > national park covers an area of 575 @ . @ 83 square kilometres ( 222 @ . @ 33 sq mi ) . it was created on 26 may 1955 under the auspices of the < unk > de < unk > e historia and was the first protected area in guatemala .

population estimates for < unk > vary from 10 @ , @ 000 to as high as 90 @ , @ 000 inhabitants , with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range .
the population of < unk > began a continuous curve of growth starting in the < unk > period ( approximately 2000 bc – ad 200 ) , with a peak in the late classic with the population growing rapidly from ad 700 through to 830 , followed by a sharp decline . for the 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the < unk > defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at < unk > per square kilometer ( < unk > per square mile ) . in an area within a 12 kilometres ( 7 @ . @ 5 mi ) radius of the site core , peak population is estimated at 120 @ , @ 000 ; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer ( < unk > per square mile ) . in a region within a 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at 425 @ , @ 000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer ( 515 per square mile ) . these population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive < unk > that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture . however , some archaeologists , such as david webster , believe these figures to be far too high .

there are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as 1000 bc , in the middle < unk > . a < unk > of < unk > ceramics dating from about 700 @ - @ 400 bc were found in a sealed < unk > , a subterranean bottle @ - @ shaped chamber .
major construction at < unk > was already taking place in the late < unk > period , first appearing around 400 – 300 bc , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still < unk > by sites further north such as el < unk > and < unk > . at this time , < unk > participated in the widespread < unk > culture that dominated the central and northern maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire < unk > peninsula including northern and eastern guatemala and all of belize .
two temples dating to late < unk > times had masonry @ - @ walled < unk > that may have been < unk > @ - @ vaulted , although this has not been proven . one of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a < unk > background , painted in yellow , black , pink and red .
in the 1st century ad rich burials first appeared and < unk > underwent a political and cultural < unk > as its giant northern neighbors declined . at the end of the late < unk > , the < unk > style art and architecture from the pacific coast began to influence < unk > , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the < unk > and early murals at the city .

< unk > rulership among the lowland maya is most deeply rooted at < unk > . according to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by < unk > @ - @ < unk > @ - @ < unk > , perhaps in the 3rd century ad . at the beginning of the early classic , power in the maya region was concentrated at < unk > and < unk > , in the core of the maya < unk > .
< unk > may have benefited from the collapse of the large < unk > states such as el < unk > . in the early classic < unk > rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the maya region , < unk > the development of other nearby maya cities .
the site , however , was often at war and inscriptions tell of < unk > and conflict with other maya states , including < unk > , < unk > , < unk > and < unk > . the site was defeated at the end of the early classic by < unk > , which rose to take < unk > ' s place as the paramount center in the southern maya lowlands . the earlier part of the early classic saw hostilities between < unk > and its neighbor < unk > , with < unk > recording the capture of prisoners from < unk > .
there appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by ad 317 , when lady < unk > < unk > conducted a < unk > @ - @ ending ceremony , apparently as queen of the city .
