By the end of this year, there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites.
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they're going to die.
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought, I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring.
What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller, who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer.
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died.
Here's what he wrote in starting that out.
"He said," "Here it is. I'm dead, and this is my last post to my blog."
"In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer, then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive." "Now, while as a journalist, Miller's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most, the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that's something completely different than anything that's been created by any previous generation."
Consider a few stats for a moment.
Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.
And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month.
So when you think about your parents or your grandparents, at best they may have created some photos or home videos, or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely, years after we're gone.
And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists.
Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist, so what I'd like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like.
Now we're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die.
One of them actually, fittingly enough, found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare.
(Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.
Death: Adam?
AO: Yeah.
Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime, even at the Organic.
AO: Who is this?
Death: Go to ifidie.net before it's too late.
(Laughter) Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?
So what that service does, quite simply, is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die.
Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories.
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones, complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die.
But what I think comes next is far more interesting.
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who, back in March, demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.
I think as machines' ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve, it's going to become possible to analyze an entire life's worth of content — the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts — that we're producing in such massive numbers.
And I think as that happens, it's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating and technology's ability to make sense of it all.
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.
One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter, to make some predictions as to what you might say next.
Well right now, as you can see, the results can be somewhat comical.
You can imagine what something like this might look like five, 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve.
Taking it a step further, MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans.
But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime?
Finally, think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States, where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper.
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive?
I think that's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we're producing and technology's ability to understand it both expand exponentially.
Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so, what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
Now I work in the solar technology industry.
And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.
It's just a quick video of what we do.
Huh. Hang on a moment.
It might take a moment to load.
(Laughter) We'll just — we can just skip — I'll just skip through the video instead... (Laughter)
No. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) This is not... (Laughter)
Okay. (Laughter)
Solar technology is...
Oh, that's all my time?
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority.
Unfortunately, the answer is yes.
Then, predictions can be made and tested.
So what do we know about complex systems?
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts.
Where are economic networks?
What we looked at in detail was ownership networks.
And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue.
How are they organized? Are they isolated?
These are companies that operate in more than one country, and we found 43,000.
Let me explain by giving you this analogy.
Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects, done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.
We call ourselves Pors and Rao, and we live and work in India.
"I'd like to begin with my very first object, which I call" "The Uncle Phone." "And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him, almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water, a pack of cigarettes."
And as I grew up, it became worse and worse, And I started to think of it as a form of control.
But of course, I could never say anything, because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family.
And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone.
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.
"And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle, I made him" "The Uncle Phone." "It's so long that it requires two people to use it."
It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.
But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college, I started missing his commands.
And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage, type his email or command and pull the paper out.
This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email.
So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital.
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.
And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism, the way my uncle likes it.
"The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call" "The Pygmies." "And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures."
So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall, and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.
And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.
And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.
And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.
So we had these panels on three walls of a room.
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.
So this is how it works.
This is a video prototype.
So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.
And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.
And they don't react to background sounds.
You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.
(Noise) But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.
(Whistling) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible.
So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche, mood swings, personalities and so on.
So this is a very early prototype.
Of course, it got much better after that.
And we made them react to people, but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.
"This is a video installation called" "The Missing Person." "And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility."
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?
So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance, and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us, using a camera that could look at people in the room, track them and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.
So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren, who's actually in the space.
And on the left side, you'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible.
Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.
It's a very early video, so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that, but that got refined pretty soon, later.
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space, and we had one monitor, one on each wall.
And as people walked into the room, they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference: one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room.
"So this is a work called" "The Sun Shadow." "And it was almost like a sheet of paper, like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun."
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust, and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it, thinking it was some crap laying around.
But as soon as they passed by, it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.
(Laughter) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man.
His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts, that it's sort of fallen into his hat, and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.
Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.
And it's kind of constrained by that circle.
Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even, it would start to wander about in the space.
And there's no wires.
So I'll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room, it activates this object.
And it very slowly, over a few minutes, sort of painfully goes up, and then it gains momentum and it looks like it's almost about to fall.
And this is an important moment, because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.
But it doesn't really need it, because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.
So this work was a real technical challenge for us, and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall, because if we made it in a way that it would topple over, then it would damage itself, and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism, or that sense of wanting to go and help it.
So I'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it's much faster.
That's my colleague. He's let it go.
Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.
But he doesn't need to, because it manages to lift itself up on its own.
So this is a work that we were very intrigued with, working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.
And it's at the scale of the night sky.
So we wrapped this around a blob-like form, which is in the shape of a teddy bear, which was hanging from the ceiling.
And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear, which is very comforting and intimate.
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space, and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.
"So this is the last work, and a work in progress, and it's called" "Space Filler." "Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room, and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume."
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something.
So we work with a lot of technology, but we don't really love technology, because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.
But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create.
And once a creature pops into our minds, it's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I love the Internet.
It's true.
Think about everything it has brought us.
Think about all the services we use, all the connectivity, all the entertainment, all the business, all the commerce.
And it's happening during our lifetimes.
I'm pretty sure that one day we'll be writing history books hundreds of years from now. This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online, the generation that built something really and truly global.
But yes, it's also true that the Internet has problems, very serious problems, problems with security and problems with privacy.
I've spent my career fighting these problems.
So let me show you something.
This here is Brain.
This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
It's the first virus we ever found for PC computers.
And we actually know where Brain came from.
We know because it says so inside the code.
Let's take a look.
All right.
"That's the boot sector of an infected floppy, and if we take a closer look inside, we'll see that right there, it says," "Welcome to the dungeon." "And then it continues, saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad."
And Basit and Amjad are first names, Pakistani first names.
In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.
(Laughter) Now, 1986.
Now it's 2011.
That's 25 years ago.
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.
So half a year ago, I decided to go to Pakistan myself.
So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.
This is from the city of Lahore, which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.
Here's a typical street view.
And here's the street or road leading to this building, which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.
And I knocked on the door.
(Laughter) You want to guess who opened the door?
Basit and Amjad; they are still there.
(Laughter) (Applause) So here standing up is Basit.
Sitting down is his brother Amjad.
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.
Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.
I asked them why.
I asked them how they feel about what they started.
And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years.
So there is some sort of justice in the world after all.
Now, the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more.
So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like.
What I'm running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer.
So let me just mount some drives. Go over there.
What we have here is a list of old viruses.
So let me just run some viruses on my computer.
For example, let's go with the Centipede virus first.
And you can see at the top of the screen, there's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one.
You know that you're infected because it actually shows up.
Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash, invented in Russia in 1992.
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.
(Siren noise) And the last example, guess what the Walker virus does?
Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected.
So it used to be fairly easy to know that you're infected by a virus, when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers.
Today, they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers.
Today, viruses are a global problem.
What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs, where we track virus infections worldwide.
So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere.
In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web, we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses, how many new examples of malware we find every single day.
Here's the latest virus we've found, in a file called Server.exe.
And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one, six seconds ago.
And if we just scroll around, it's just massive.
We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.
And that's the last 20 minutes of malware every single day.
So where are all these coming from then?
Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses.
It's gangs like — let's go to GangstaBucks.com.
This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers.
So if you are a virus writer and you're capable of infecting Windows computers, but you don't know what to do with them, you can sell those infected computers — somebody else's computers — to these guys.
And they'll actually pay you money for those computers.
So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers?
Well there's multiple different ways, such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking, or keyloggers.
Keyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view, and they record everything you type.
So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.
Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals.
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.
Same thing with every single password and so on.
But the thing that they're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store.
Because when you do purchases in online stores, you will be typing in your name, the delivery address, your credit card number and the credit card security codes.
And here's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.
That's the credit card number, that's the expiration date, that's the security code, and that's the name of the owner of the card.
Once you gain access to other people's credit card information, you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information.
And that, obviously, is a problem.
We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime.
One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations: we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons.
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden, and his partner in crime, also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages, Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain, a U.S. citizen.
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U., a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.
They are both right now on the run.
Nobody knows where they are.
U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago, froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant.
And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks.
We know that online criminals are hiring programmers, hiring testing people, testing their code, having back-end systems with SQL databases.
And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build.
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage.
I mean, the Internet is international.
That's why we call it the Internet.
And if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world, here's a video built by Clarified Networks, which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.
This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia, moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down.
So you just can't shut these guys down.
They will switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this.
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world.
Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us.
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals?
How do you actually track them down?
Let me give you an example.
What we have here is one exploit file.
Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file, which contains an exploit.
And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer, it actually takes over your computer and runs code.
Now, if you'll take a look at this image file — well there's the image header, and there the actual code of the attack starts.
And that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it.
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.
You just have to believe me, it is, it is.
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it.
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.
And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.
But just keep staring at it.
You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address: unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program.
And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.
But even more interestingly, if we continue decrypting, we'll find this mysterious string, which says O600KO78RUS.
That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature.
It's not used for anything.
And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.
So obviously I Googled for it.
I got zero hits; wasn't there.
So I spoke with the guys at the lab.
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs, and one of them mentioned, well, it ends in RUS like Russia.
And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg.
For example, you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that.
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg, and through a long road, we eventually found this one particular website.
Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website, and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.
And on this blog, he blogs about his life, about his life in St. Petersburg — he's in his early 20s — about his cat, about his girlfriend.
And he drives a very nice car.
In fact, this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower.
Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.
How do I know about this car?
Because he blogged about the car.
He actually had a car accident.
In downtown St. Petersburg, he actually crashed his car into another car.
And he put blogged images about the car accident — that's his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS.
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture, you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS.
"Now I'm not a lawyer, but if I would be, this is where I would say," "I rest my case." "(Laughter) So what happens when online criminals are caught?"
Well in most cases it never gets this far.
The vast majority of the online crime cases, we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.
And even if we are able to find online criminals, quite often there is no outcome.
The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence, or for some reason we can't take them down.
I wish it would be easier; unfortunately it isn't.
But things are also changing at a very rapid pace.
You've all heard about things like Stuxnet.
So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these.
That's a Siemens S7-400 PLC, programmable logic [controller].
And this is what runs our infrastructure.
This is what runs everything around us.
PLC's, these small boxes which have no display, no keyboard, which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.
For example, the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these.
And when Stuxnet infects one of these, that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about.
Because everything around us is being run by these.
I mean, we have critical infrastructure.
You go to any factory, any power plant, any chemical plant, any food processing plant, you look around — everything is being run by computers.
Everything is being run by computers.
Everything is reliant on these computers working.
We have become very reliant on Internet, on basic things like electricity, obviously, on computers working.
And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us.
We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail.
(Laughter) (Applause) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren't there.
It's actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity, thinking about backups, thinking about the things that actually matter.
Now I told you — (Laughter) I love the Internet. I do.
Think about all the services we have online.
Think about if they are taken away from you, if one day you don't actually have them for some reason or another.
I see beauty in the future of the Internet, but I'm worried that we might not see that.
I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime.
Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us.
(Laughter) I've spent my life defending the Net, and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime, we are running a risk of losing it all.
We have to do this globally, and we have to do it right now.
What we need is more global, international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks.
That's much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.
What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks, and even more importantly, we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime, but haven't yet done it.
We have to find the people with the skills, but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack, and all it requires of you is this: that you change your posture for two minutes.
But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body.
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter) I see you.
So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.
So, we're really fascinated with body language, and we're particularly interested in other people's body language.
You know, we're interested in, like, you know — (Laughter) — an awkward interaction, or a smile, or a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink, or maybe even something like a handshake.
Narrator: Here they are arriving at Number 10.
Even the BBC and The New York Times.
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior, or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it's language, so we think about communication.
When we think about communication, we think about interactions.
And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this.
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.
And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.
For example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University, shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions, their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued.
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
We are also influenced by our nonverbals, our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.
So what nonverbals am I talking about?
I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice, and I teach at a competitive business school, so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance.
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?
So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.
So you make yourself big, you stretch out, you take up space, you're basically opening up.
It's about opening up.
This expression, which is known as pride, Jessica Tracy has studied.
We make ourselves small.
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power.
So if someone is being really powerful with us, we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them.
So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom, and what do I notice?
When they sit down, they're sort of spread out.
You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in. As soon they come in, you see it.
I notice a couple of things about this.
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.
Women feel chronically less powerful than men, so this is not surprising.
And this is really important in the MBA classroom, because participation counts for half the grade.
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.
So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating.
There's some evidence that they do.
So, for example, we smile when we feel happy, but also, when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy.
So it goes both ways.
So the second question really was, you know, so we know that our minds change our bodies, but is it also true that our bodies change our minds?
And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about?
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like?
So powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly, more assertive and more confident, more optimistic.
They actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance.
So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks.
But really, power is also about how you react to stress.
So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant, high on testosterone, but really stress reactive?
Probably not, right?
So we have this evidence, both that the body can shape the mind, at least at the facial level, and also that role changes can shape the mind.
So what happens, okay, you take a role change, what happens if you do that at a really minimal level, like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention?
Here are a couple more.
So you can be standing or you can be sitting.
And here are the low-power poses.
So you're folding up, you're making yourself small.
When you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself.
So this is what happens.
That's it. That's the whole experiment.
Here's what we find on testosterone.
So again, two minutes, and you get these changes.
Here's what you get on cortisol.
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves, so it's not just others, but it's also ourselves.
Also, our bodies change our minds.
And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations, like social threat situations.
Again, this is not about you talking to other people.
It's you talking to yourself.
So that's what we want to test. Okay?
It's five minutes long. They are being recorded.
So for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.
People hate this.
We then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.
They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions.
It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.
These kinds of things.
So this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect.
So I said, fake it till you make it.
I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud.
I don't want to feel like an impostor.
When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.
I was thrown out of a car, rolled several times.
I was thrown from the car.
I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart, and I had been called gifted as a child.
So I'm taken out of college, I keep trying to go back.
"They say," "You're not going to finish college."
I am an impostor.
You're going to stay, and this is what you're going to do.
"Like, I have become this. I am actually doing this. '" "So that's what I did."
I don't feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.
Like, she can fake it, she can become it.
So she had changed.
And so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it.
Fake it till you become it.
Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize.
The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this.
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.
So, this is two minutes.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
That's what you want to do.
Get your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down.
Don't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.
Thank you.
Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.
Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.
Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom, make education seem like a bright idea.
(Laughter) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation, or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.
Great creativity can make politicians electable, or parties unelectable.
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips.
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze.
Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable, more magical. And now we need that magic.
This is a time of need.
Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well: to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.
To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps.
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener.
(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk.
Narrator: And so he walked, and as he walked he saw things.
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.
A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.
And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart.
Sure, she had aged a little.
In fact, she had aged a lot.
But he felt all his old passion for her return.
"" "Ford," "he called softly. For that was her name."
"" "Don't say another word, Gusty," "she said, for that was his name."
"" "I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here."
"Let's go there and make love. In the tent." "Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other."
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.
The earth moved for both of them.
And they lived together happily ever after.
And all because he decided to walk that day.
(Applause) Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate.
The moral imperative is on the table.
Great creativity is needed to take it all, make it simple and sharp.
To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.
So this is a call, a plea, to the incredibly talented TED community.
Let's get creative against climate change.
And let's do it soon. Thank you.
(Applause)
Beau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.
All you have to do is read what you see. Right?
So, I'm going to count to you, so we don't all do it together.
Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this?
BL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three.Audience: You are not reading this.
BL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter) If you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three.
Audience: What are you reading?
BL: What are you reading? There are no words there.
I said, read what you're seeing. Right?
"It literally says," "Wat ar ou rea in?" "(Laughter) Right?"
That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?
It's because perception is grounded in our experience.
Right? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it, which means we never see what's there, we never see information, we only ever see what was useful to see in the past.
All right? Which means, when it comes to perception, we're all like this frog.
(Laughter) Right? It's getting information. It's generating behavior that's useful. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause) BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way, we get a little bit annoyed, right?
But we're talking about perception here, right?
And perception underpins everything we think, we know, we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear, falling in love, everything begins with perception.
Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means we're only ever responding according to what we've done before.
But actually, it's a tremendous problem, because how can we ever see differently?
Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently, and all new perceptions begin in the same way.
They begin with a question.
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty.
Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.
Okay? (Laughter) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.
Right? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because it's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.
Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill.
"The question" "why?" "is one of the most dangerous things you can do, because it takes you into uncertainty."
And yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space.
So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately, evolution has given us an answer, right?
And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.
They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right?
It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin, or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space.
So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?
It's play.
Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being.
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.
Right? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility, and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding, and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means is that we play to play. Play is its own reward.
Now if you look at these five ways of being, these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist.
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper.
It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true for anything that is creative.
So if you add rules to play, you have a game.
That's actually what an experiment is.
So armed with these two ideas, that science is a way of being and experiments are play, we asked, can anyone become a scientist?
And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?
Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently, but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?
The first step was to ask a question.
Now, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn't make a useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it.
So we did it anyway. Right? Of course.
So, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right?
So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists.
Now here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right?
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study, and she's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage, will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right?
Now, science and asking questions is about courage.
Now she is the personification of courage, because she's going to stand up here and talk to you all.
So Amy, would you please come up? (Applause) (Applause) So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you the question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy.
Amy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think, because we look alike.
But we wondered if there's a possible link with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar, since they seem so different from us.
So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way.
Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions. So what if bees can think like us?
Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells.
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should, because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather, or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause) BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment, and so — well, game — and so, Amy, can you tell us what the game was, and the puzzle that you set the bees?
AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern.
They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue, or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.
Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?
What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.
It was completely new, and no one had done it before, including adults. (Laughter) BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.
It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing, because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was the collaborator on this project. Okay?
So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it, but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly.
(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do — Student: 5C.
Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here? Student: Yeah.
Dave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here?
"BL:" "Can you help me, Henry?" "What good scientist says that, right?"
Student: There's two up there.
And three in here.
BL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.
They do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc.
And now we want to share. That's the next step.
So we're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication. Right? So we have to write it up.
So we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter) The one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter) Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections: an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.
The introduction says, what's the question and why?
Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?
And the discussion is, who cares? Right?
That's a science paper, basically. (Laughter) So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative, which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.
"It's not written by me. It's written by Amy and the other students in the class. As a consequence, this science paper begins," "Once upon a time..." "(Laughter) The results section, it says:" "Training phase, the puzzle... duh duh duuuuuhhh." "Right? (Laughter) And the methods, it says," "Then we put the bees into the fridge (and made bee pie)," "smiley face. Right? (Laughter) This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published."
So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.
"The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because if it were ever referenced, it would be" "Blackawton et al," "and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal, and it says this. It said many things, but it said this."
"" "I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways." "(Laughter) In other words, it starts off" "once upon a time," "the figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter) So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves, who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world, and he says," "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" "— (Laughter) —" and it certainly deserves wide exposure. ""
"Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says," "The paper is magnificent."
"The work would be publishable if done by adults." "So what did we do? We send it back to the editor."
They say no.
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right, putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters.
And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees, and it was published. Okay? (Applause) (Applause) It took four months to do the science, two years to get it published. (Laughter) Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world.
What was the feedback like?
Well, it was published two days before Christmas, downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?
It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.
It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.
It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.
Last year, it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well.
And I'll just read one.
"" "I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now."
What you guys have done is real, true and amazing.
Curiosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science.
Who else can have these qualities more than children?
"Please congratulate your children's team from my side." "So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor."
Can I do it on you? (Laughter) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.
Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter) For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter) And you like technology, right?
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.
BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay.
Now... (Laughter) Okay. (Laughter) Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?
You have to close your eyes, and you have to point where you hear me clapping. All right?
(Clapping) (Clapping) Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three?
Audience: (Shouts) (Laughter) (Shouts) (Laughter) Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.
Everyone over there shout. (Shouts) Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) What's the point? The point is what science does for us.
Right? We normally walk through life responding, but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes, he was able to see the world in a new way.
That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?
Now, true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice, so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.
So, Amy?
AO: This project was really exciting for me, because it brought the process of discovery to life, and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone, has the potential to discover something new, and that a small question can lead into a big discovery.
Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person feels about change.
But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy. Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle, I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject, and that anyone can discover something new.
You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause)
The year is 1800.
A curious little invention is being talked about.
It's called a microscope.
What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye.
Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases.
Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup, not very far from here. This is from London.
Fast forward 200 years.
We still have this monster soup around, and it's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt.
Just for malaria itself, there are a million deaths a year, and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections.
Now it's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters.
You take a stain, like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa, and a microscope, and you look at them.
They all have faces.
Why is that so, that Alex in Kenya, Fatima in Bangladesh, Navjoot in Mumbai, and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick?
And that's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach.
And remember that number: one billion.
The problem lies with the microscope itself.
Even though the pinnacle of modern science, research microscopes are not designed for field testing.
Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all.
They are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain, and cost a lot of money.
Two of my students, Jim and James, traveled around India and Thailand, starting to think about this problem a lot.
We saw all kinds of donated equipment.
We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.
And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn't know how to even turn it on.
What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.
So what is a Foldscope?
A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope, a platform for fluorescence, bright-field, polarization, projection, all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper.
So, now you think, how is that possible?
I'm going to show you some examples here, and we will run through some of them.
It starts with a single sheet of paper.
What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope.
So, there are three stages: There is the optical stage, the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage.
And there are micro optics at the bottom that's actually embedded in the paper itself.
This paper has no instructions and no languages.
There is a code, a color code embedded, that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope.
When it's done, it looks something like this, has all the functionalities of a standard microscope, just like an XY stage, a place where a sample slide could go, for example right here.
So this is what changes, but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases.
You pop this in.
So what's really interesting about this object, and my students hate when I do this, but I'm going to do this anyway, is these are rugged devices.
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it.
And they last, even though they're designed from a very flexible material, like paper.
Another fun fact is, this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool, but here in this envelope I have 30 different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder.
And I'm going to pick one randomly.
This one, it turns out, is actually designed specifically for malaria, because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria.
So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this.
So up till now, you didn't actually see what I would see from one of these setups.
So what I would like to do is, if we could dim the lights, please, it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes.
I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project, and this way you will see exactly what I would see.
What you're looking at — (Applause) — This is a cross-section of a compound eye, and when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there, I am going through the z-axis.
You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern.
Another example, one of my favorite insects, I love to hate this one, is a mosquito, and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.
Right there.
All from the simple setup that I actually described.
You get to see the beam the way it's projected and bent.
Can we get the lights back on again?
So I'm quickly going to show you, since I'm running out of time, in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture, the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing, so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.
(Applause) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy, which we call use-and-throw microscopy.
Here is a sheet of paper.
This is when we were thinking about the idea.
This is an A4 sheet of paper.
These are the three stages that you actually see.
And the optical components, if you look at the inset up on the right, we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs, so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.
So that's where the lenses go.
There are some light sources.
And essentially, in the end, all the parts line up because of origami, because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment.
So here is another obvious thing that we would do, typically, if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust, is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself.
There it is, and it survives.
So for us, the next step actually is really finishing our field trials.
We are starting at the end of the summer.
We are at a stage where we'll be making thousands of microscopes.
We've started collecting data for malaria, Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.
And I want to leave you with this picture.
I had not anticipated this before, but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health.
What are the tools that we're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow?
Thank you.
(Applause)
So it's 1995, I'm in college, and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence, Rhode Island to Portland, Oregon.
And you know, we're young and unemployed, so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take.
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota, I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles.
"" What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road? ""
My friend looks at me totally blankly.
There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.
"(Laughter) And I'm like," "You know, all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them." "She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about."
And what I'm talking about is this.
(Laughter) Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area. (Laughter)
I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us, and how we behave when that happens, and what all of this can tell us about human nature.
In other words, as you heard Chris say, I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong.
This might strike you as a strange career move, but it actually has one great advantage: no job competition.
(Laughter) In fact, most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong, or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong.
We get it in the abstract.
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.
The human species, in general, is fallible — okay fine.
But when it comes down to me, right now, to all the beliefs I hold, here in the present tense, suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.
We go to meetings in the present tense; we go on family vacations in the present tense; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.
So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life, trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything.
I think this is a problem.
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.
So what I want to do today is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right.
And second, why it's such a problem.
And finally, I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.
So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right?
One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.
So let me ask you guys something — or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here: How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong?
Dreadful. Thumbs down.
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing — thank you, these are great answers, but they're answers to a different question.
You guys are answering the question: How does it feel to realize you're wrong?
(Laughter) Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake.
But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything.
I'll give you an analogy.
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon, there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff, which is fine — he's a bird, he can fly.
But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.
And what's funny — at least if you're six years old — is that the coyote's totally fine too.
He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air.
That's when he falls.
When we're wrong about something — not when we realize it, but before that — we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.
You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground.
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.
It does feel like something to be wrong; it feels like being right.
(Laughter) So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.
I call this error blindness.
Most of the time, we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something, until it's too late.
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural.
Think back for a moment to elementary school.
You're sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this.
This is not mine, by the way.
(Laughter) So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper.
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker, the one who never does his homework.
So by the time you are nine years old, you've already learned, first of all, that people who get stuff wrong are lazy, irresponsible dimwits — and second of all, that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes.
We learn these really bad lessons really well.
And a lot of us — and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over-achievers.
Right, Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?
(Laughter) You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.
Okay, so fine.
Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.
Because according to this, getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us.
So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe.
So let me tell you a story.
A couple of years ago, a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.
Beth Israel's in Boston.
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country.
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.
Everything seems to have gone fine.
"And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says," "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?" "Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one."
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident, he said something very interesting.
"He said," "For whatever reason, the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient." "(Laughter) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous."
This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world.
And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy.
So this is a huge practical problem.
But it's also a huge social problem.
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality.
And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you?
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way, by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant.
They don't have access to the same information that we do, and when we generously share that information with them, they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.
When that doesn't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots.
(Laughter) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.
And when that doesn't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes.
So this is a catastrophe.
This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly.
But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human.
It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds.
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing.
That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.
The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is.
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.
We can remember the past, and we can think about the future, and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place.
And we all do this a little differently, which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this.
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.
"1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about" "I think therefore I am," "this guy, St. Augustine, sat down and wrote" "Fallor ergo sum" "—" I err therefore I am. ""
Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up, it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system, something we can eradicate or overcome.
It's totally fundamental to who we are.
Because, unlike God, we don't really know what's going on out there.
And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.
To me, this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity.
Last year, for various reasons, I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life.
And so I'm listening and I'm listening, and at some point, I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong.
"And my first thought was," "I've lost it."
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.
"I just imagined it everywhere," "which has happened."
But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.
"And I mentioned this to him, and he was like," "No actually, that's true."
"In fact," "he says," "as a staff, we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme."
"And the crypto-theme is: 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is," "says Ira Glass," "we need this."
"We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work." "And for the rest of us, audience members, as listeners, as readers, we eat this stuff up."
We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings.
When it comes to our stories, we love being wrong.
But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this.
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead.
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq, find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction, liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.
And something else happened instead.
And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life, until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.
And something else happened instead.
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.
And something else happened instead.
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize.
And something else happened instead.
(Laughter) I mean, this is life.
For good and for ill, we generate these incredible stories about the world around us, and then the world turns around and astonishes us.
No offense, but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong.
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements?
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh.
(Laughter) Didn't really work out that way, did it? (Laughter)
Where's my jet pack, Chris? (Laughter)
(Applause) So here we are again.
And that's how it goes.
We come up with another idea.
We tell another story.
We hold another conference.
The theme of this one, as you guys have now heard seven million times, is the rediscovery of wonder.
"And to me, if you really want to rediscover wonder, you need to step outside of that tiny, terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say," "Wow, I don't know."
"Maybe I'm wrong." "Thank you."
(Applause) Thank you guys. (Applause)
Sustainability represents the what, the where and the how of what is caught.
The who and the why are what's important to me.
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.
I want to know how I impact them.
I want to know how they impact me.
I want to know why they fish.
I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living.
Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem.
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat.
So what do we call this?
I think we call it restorative seafood.
Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.
Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource, suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency.
It is a more hopeful, it is a more human, and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.
Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.
The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red, think twice about yellow.
But in my mind, it's really not enough to just eat green list.
We can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red.
But what if we eat only in the green list?
You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks.
Pole caught — no bycatch.
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.
But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.
What's the context of this meal?
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?
Do I do this three times a week?
I might still be in the green list, but I'm not doing myself, or you, or the oceans any favors.
The point is that we have to have a context, a gauge for our actions in all this.
Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy.
That's great! I love red wine!
I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.
Well, how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem?
Well folks, we have a protein problem.
We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food, and we are paying a cost.
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.
We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs.
Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman, but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.
Vegetables: they might yet save the oceans.
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.
Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue.
We must continue to eat the best seafood possible, if at all.
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.
The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.
It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy, grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake.
Whooo!
This is an easy sell.
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart.
Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat.
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat.
There's a pattern here.
Forget nuclear holocaust; it's the fork that we have to worry about.
We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.
And so I think it's time we change what we expect from our food.
Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.
So let's start there.
There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.
Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.
But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters.
Just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.
We have eco-friendly shrimp.
We can make them; we have that technology.
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.
It doesn't work.
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood.
While we try to manage declining marine populations, the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.
Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood.
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.
But it's not all about the seafood.
It's about the way that we look at our plates.
As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.
A couple things happened.
I made more money.
People started buying appetizers and salads, because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.
People spent more time engaging in their meals, engaging with each other over their meals.
People got, in short, more of what they came there for even though they got less protein.
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.
They got healthier. I made more money.
This is great.
Environmental consideration was served with every plate, but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time.
One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.
Shellfish, mussels, oysters, clams, tilapia, char — these were the common species.
We were directing tastes towards more resilience, more restorative options.
This is what we need to favor.
This is what the green list says.
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.
But what of those big predators, those fashionable species, that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean, so here we go.
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.
Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.
Put it on four plates.
Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have, light the candles and celebrate it.
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.
Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year, maybe.
I expect a lot from food.
I expect health and joy and family and community.
I expect that producing ingredients, preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests.
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.
And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents.
I remember well the meals of my childhood.
They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch, usually rice.
This is still how I largely eat today.
I get sick when I go to steakhouses.
I get the meat sweats.
It's like a hangover from protein.
It's disgusting.
But of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans, I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right.
Eat your vegetables.
It's pretty straightforward.
So what are we looking for in a meal?
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body.
For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.
For family, I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories.
For community though, we start at the very beginning.
There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact.
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it.
We've seen an image of our blue planet, our world bank.
But it is more than just a repository of our resources; it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner.
So if we all take only what we need, then we can begin to share the rest, we can begin to celebrate, we can begin to restore.
We need to savor vegetables.
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.
And we need to save dinner.
Thank you.
(Applause)
1986, much, much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues, I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure.
It's very complicated to test the new material for the building, but this is much stronger than I expected, and also it's very easy to waterproof, and also, because it's industrial material, it's also possible to fireproof.
Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.
So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes, recyclable paper.
My goal of the design is not when it's completed.
So that was the goal of my design.
Those are invisible.
So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture.
So that is why I started working in disaster areas.
1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.
Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.
Over two million people became refugees.
It just became big, heavy deforestation and an environmental problem.
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.
"And he said," "Oh God, are you crazy?"
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park.
So I proposed to rebuild. I raised — did fundraising.
2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.
It's still used, even after the current earthquake in China.
In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.
So I proposed to the mayor, I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.
After the earthquake and tsunami, people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.
But it's really necessary to do it.
Now I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.
Thank you very much.
What is going on in this baby's mind?
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago, most people, including psychologists, would have said that this baby was irrational, illogical, egocentric — that he couldn't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect.
In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture.
So in some ways, we think that this baby's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.
Let me give you just one example of this.
One thing that this baby could be thinking about, that could be going on in his mind, is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby.
After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.
Anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get.
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people.
Now the question is: How could we ask them?
Babies, after all, can't talk, and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks, what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that.
So how do we actually ask them the question?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.
What we did — Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food: one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley, like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.
(Laughter) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.
So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person.
"But half the time, what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go," "Mmmmm, broccoli."
"I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm." "And then she would take a little bit of the crackers, and she'd go," "Eww, yuck, crackers."
"I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck." "So she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted."
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.
"And then she would simply put her hand out and say," Can you give me some? ""
So the question is: What would the baby give her, what they liked or what she liked?
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies, just barely walking and talking, would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers, but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.
On the other hand, 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli, like they couldn't figure this out.
But then after they stared for a long time, they would just give her the crackers, what they thought everybody must like.
So there are two really remarkable things about this.
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature, that we don't always want the same thing.
And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted.
Even more remarkably though, the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep, profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old.
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought.
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that's actually demonstrated it.
The question you might ask though is: Why do children learn so much?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time?
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless.
And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless, because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive.
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies, it turns out that there's actually an answer.
If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates, but also including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are.
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.
On one side is a New Caledonian crow.
And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth, are incredibly smart birds.
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.
And this is a bird on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food.
On the other hand, we have our friend the domestic chicken.
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps.
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain, and they're not much good at doing anything else.
Well it turns out that the babies, the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.
They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years, which is a really long time in the life of a bird.
Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months.
So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot.
There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning.
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?
Well some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well.
So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment.
Other creatures, like the crows, aren't very good at doing anything in particular, but they're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments.
And of course, we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal.
We're smarter, we're more flexible, we can learn more, we survive in more different environments, we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species.
My son is 23.
(Laughter) And at least until they're 23, we're still popping those worms into those little open mouths.
All right, why would we see this correlation?
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage.
And that one big disadvantage is that, until you actually do all that learning, you're going to be helpless.
"So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself," A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better? ""
You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up.
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor.
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.
We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.
And then as adults, we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species.
So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas, and we're production and marketing.
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use.
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups, we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring, and we're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning, that's what they're for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.
And in fact, the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet.
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.
And there's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently.
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy, the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize, describe, the way that scientists find out about the world.
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.
They go out and test it against the evidence.
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.
Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth.
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.
And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now.
And some 10 years ago, I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.
So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes, I think it actually looks something like this.
This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they're revising to figure out how the world works.
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.
Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics, they look extremely stupid.
How could it be that children are doing statistics?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector.
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others.
And using this very simple machine, my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world.
Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.
If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector.
But actually, this detector works in a bit of a strange way.
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector, something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with, the detector will actually activate two out of three times.
Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector, it will only activate two out of six times.
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence.
It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.
So we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence, and we just asked them to make it go.
And sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector.
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.
The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.
They're just learning how to count.
But unconsciously, they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure.
And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world, that seems very unlikely to begin with.
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.
So in these circumstances, the children are using statistics to find out about the world, but after all, scientists also do experiments, and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.
"When children do experiments we call it" "getting into everything" "or else" "playing." "And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program."
Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.
And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't, and then she showed them an anomaly.
And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes.
(Video) Boy: How about this?
Same as the other side.
Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.
(Laughter) Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.
AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.
Boy: What's making this light up.
(Laughter) I don't know.
AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.
(Laughter) Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this, and this needs to be like this.
AG: Okay, hypothesis two.
Boy: That's why.
Oh.
(Laughter) AG: Now this is his next idea.
He told the experimenter to do this, to try putting it out onto the other location.
Not working either.
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here.
Oh, the bottom of this box has electricity in here, but this doesn't have electricity.
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.
Boy: It's lighting up.
So when you put four.
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up.
AG: Okay, there's his fifth hypothesis.
Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy, but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something, what they really do is do a series of experiments.
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes?
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers, a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all.
And I think just the opposite is true.
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.
And adults' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight.
So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important, we should pay attention to it.
Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid, and everything else sort of goes dark.
And we even know something about the way the brain does this.
So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains, sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible, more plastic, better at learning, and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains.
So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.
If we look at babies and young children, we see something very different.
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness.
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing.
But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once.
And if you actually look in their brains, you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity, and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention, what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.
So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important.
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness, that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn.
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new, or when we're in a new city for the first time.
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands, so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.
And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters.
So what's it like to be a baby?
It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double-espressos.
(Laughter) That's a fantastic way to be, but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning. (Laughter)
Now it's good to be a grownup.
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.
It's good to be a grownup.
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do.
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies, to have open-mindedness, open learning, imagination, creativity, innovation, maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children.
(Applause)
I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner.
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour, onstage, having the time of my life.
The next day, all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island, where he was going to give a conference to the world's press, standing in front of his former prison cell.
You can see the bars of the window there.
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
In that moment in time, Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation, a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims, the most vulnerable of all, were women and children.
This was a huge impact on my mind, because I am a woman and I am a mother, and I hadn't realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way.
"I have to serve." "And so, subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences, interviews, talking and using my platform as a musician, with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous, unbelievable work that he had done."
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela, everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.
I met him at a 46664 event.
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV, people who are living with HIV.
"And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt I say," "Yes, we can talk about this issue."
"It doesn't have to be in the closet." "I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization."
It's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women, most of whom are HIV-positive.
They work in the field.
They have education programs.
They bring out the issues of stigma.
It's quite extraordinary what they do.
So this is my SING Campaign.
SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me.
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries.
Here I am in Oslo in Norway, getting a nice, fat check; singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
This is in the Scottish Parliament.
And once again, in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus.
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach.
The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015.
It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will.
And here I am with a pregnant woman, who is HIV positive and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident, because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life.
It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic.
Now, I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile.
This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go.
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans.
Avelile's mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness.
Avelile had the virus, she was born with the virus.
And here she is at seven years old, weighing no more than a one year-old baby.
At this point in her life, she's suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia.
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child.
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her.
Five months later, we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again.
This is the transformation that took place.
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
So, I would like to say to you, each one in the audience, if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care, and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals, specifically five and six, should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up.
(Applause)
Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union, a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside.
With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space.
The rocket was huge.
And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside.
On October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.
"One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time:" "We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik."
In the olden days, explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.
Now we have the good fortune to open up space.
"And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy." "You're watching snippets from" "Sputnik," "my fifth documentary feature, which is just about completed."
It tells the story of Sputnik, and the story of what happened to America as a result.
For days after the launch, Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens, it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space.
But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday, the media and the politicians told us, and we believed, that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology, and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs, using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.
All hell broke loose.
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11.
It provoked the missile gap.
It exploded an arms race.
It began the space race.
Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases, and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000.
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.
For example, some here will remember this day, June 1958, the National Civil Defense Drill, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.
Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen, and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed.
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.
For example, some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik.
Support for engineering, math and science — education in general — boomed.
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA, and the Internet, and, of course, NASA.
My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media.
But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation, into something that was overall very good for America.
"" "Sputnik" "will soon be released."
In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors: longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.
And I'd like to thank you all.
(Applause).
Thank you, Chris.
Good morning. So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve, to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow.
As a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced.
You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.
It's new technology. You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data: names of places, monuments, buildings, maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street.
So these are my illusion glasses.
They're a little bigger. They're a prototype.
And when you look through them, you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist.
Let me show you what I mean.
All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.
Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again.
All right. Very significant mark.
And let's put it back into the deck, somewhere in the middle, and let's get started.
(Music) Voice: System ready. Acquiring image.
Marco Tempest: For those of you who don't play cards, a deck of cards is made up of four different suits: hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades.
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols, and have been interpreted in many different ways.
Now, some say that the four suits represent the four seasons.
There's spring, summer, autumn and â   Voice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too.
Winter is like magic. It's a time of change, when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow, and then it all disappears.
There are 13 cards in each suit. (Music) Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.
MT: So over here is low tide, and over here is high tide, and in the middle is the moon.
Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.
MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.
There is the color red and the color black, representing the constant change from day to night.
Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that. (Laughter) MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?
(Music) Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards, the result is 365.
MT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year, the number of days between each birthday.
Make a wish. (Blowing noise) Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.
MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards, and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls, men and women, husbands and wives, even kings and queens. (Applause) Voice: And who are these? MT: Ah, mischief-makers. Watch.
Wake up.
Joker: Whoa.MT: Are you ready for your party piece?
Joker: Ready! MT: Let me see what you've got.
Joker: Presenting my pogo stick.MT: Ah. Watch out.
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music) MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience.
I'm performing for you.
Voice: Signed card detected.MT: Well, sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job?
Of course not! You've got to practice 24 / 7.
I don't literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week.
24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration, but it does take practice. Now, some people will say, well, magic, that must be the work of some evil supernatural force. (Laughter) (Applause) (Music) Whoa.
Well, to this, I just say, no no.
Actually, in German, it's nein nein. (Laughter) Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you, though, if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this, don't play for money.
(Music) Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand.
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one.
MT: Yeah, but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds.
Voice: I think you got your birthday wish.MT: And that actually leaves me with the last, and most important card of all: the one with this very significant mark on it.
And unlike anything else we've just seen, virtual or not.Voice: Signed card detected.
Digital MT: This is without a question the real thing.
MT: Bye bye. (Music) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause)
So I would like to show you something I've been working on.
There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges.
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.
It's awful.
In fact, they're a ton of fun.
(Applause)
Hi. So today, I'd like to share some works in progress.
Since we are still realizing these works, we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery, still.
So I'm going to try and describe some of the experiences that we're looking for through each of the works.
So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes.
A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room, and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall.
Within seconds, as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer, they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry.
(Laughter) So this is the sketch of the two states.
One is total chaos. The other is absolute order.
And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state.
This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions.
One is the altar tablets of the 15th century, and the other is about 100 years ago, Malevich's abstract compositions.
So I'm just going to take you to a video.
To give you a sense of scale, the largest panel is about two meters high.
That's about this much. And the smallest one is an A4.
So a viewer enters the space, and they snap to attention.
And after a while, if the viewer continues to remain in the space, the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again, until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement, when they will again snap to attention.
(Laughter) So here it appears as if it's the viewer that's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels, but it could also be the other way around, that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant.
So this brings me to a quieter, small work called Handheld.
The viewer sees a piece of paper that's mounted on the far end of the wall, but when you go closer, you see that it's a blank A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper, that's held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood.
The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly, as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time, and somehow are not managing to.
So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera.
So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.
One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera.
And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view.
So we've just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel.
So here's a video.
You have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet.
But to us, we're sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper.
That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them.
The next work is Decoy.
This is a cardboard model, so the object is about as tall as I am.
It has a rounded body, two arms, and a very tall, head-like antenna, and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself.
So when a viewer passes by, it sort of tilts from side to side, and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer.
So here is the first test scenario.
You see the two movements integrated, and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation.
But the idea is that once it's got the person's attention, it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.
(Laughter) So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.
It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines.
Because we are always working from a very personal space, we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance, at least.
And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention, but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.
The next work is an object, that's also a kind of sound instrument.
In the shape of an amphitheater that's scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage.
So from where I'm standing, each of you appears to be this big, and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision.
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures.
They're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will.
This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap, how hard, for how long, how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others, and if they want to contribute to innovation.
So when the viewer steps in front of the audience, there will be a response.
It could be a few claps or a strong applause, and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage, and again the audience will respond.
It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience, or it could be a very loud ovation.
So to us, I think we're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it, an instrument.
So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied, nuanced musical or sound patterns, but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response.
So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved.
It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.
So here if you see we're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands.
So here's a small visual animation, as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension.
And here is a prototype.
So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.
Okay, this is the last work. It's called the Framerunners.
It comes out of the idea of a window.
This is an actual window in our studio, and as you can see, it's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections.
So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that's suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides.
This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.
They're also made up of three different sizes, as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain.
Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks.
So in contrast to this very tight grid, we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality, as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path.
So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they're oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content, until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall.
So to us, this work also presents its own contradiction.
These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid, which is like a prison, but also a fortress, because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world.
So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration, and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.
So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement.
So it's really quite small.
You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand.
So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio, and here it is.
(Laughter) Thank you.
(Applause)
And my initial conclusion was that they're just better people.
I can't simply instruct two people to cooperate, and they will.
So where does that feeling come from?
Nothing personal.
And when we felt safe amongst our own, the natural reaction was trust and cooperation.
It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger.
We have no control over these forces.
"I said," "Why do you have treat us like cattle?"
"Why can't you treat us like human beings?" "And this is exactly what she said to me."
It's because they don't fear their leaders.
It's not the numbers.
It's that they have violated the very definition of leadership.
They have violated this deep-seated social contract.
Great leaders would never sacrifice
"They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader's vision comes to life, and when we ask them," "Why would you do that?"
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations, at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.
"So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says," "Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?" "And I sat, and I was like," "Man, I would buy that, eh?" "So I went home, and I did a little research, and I found some very shocking statistics."
Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation.
Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa, and five million of them are in South Africa.
Various diseases thrive in this environment, the most drastic of which is called trachoma.
Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind.
The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year. The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma, all you have to do is wash your face: no medicine, no pills, no injections.
and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?
So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.
Now we need to get this thing into practice.
"Fast forward four years later, after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone, having written my patent on the cell phone, I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country, and — (" "No more bathing!" ") — I can't say any more than that. (Laughter) I had invented DryBath, the world's first bath-substituting lotion."
You literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe.
(Laughter) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had, I went to university, met a few people, got it into practice, and we have a fully functioning product that's ready to go to the market. It's actually available on the market.
So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available.
One of the things we learned was that poor communities don't buy products in bulk.
They buy products on demand. A person in Alex doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette each day, even though it's more expensive.
So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.
You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.
And the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand.
After creating that model, we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product.
We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath. (Laughter) At least once a week.
Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath, and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas, two hours more for school, two hours more for homework, two hours more to just be a kid.
After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down to our key value proposition, which was cleanliness and convenience.
DryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver.
What's stopping you? (Applause) I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.
And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process, last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.
I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world, the first African to get that accolade, and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you.
(Applause.)
So with this focus on cost-cutting, I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient?
It's a big part of the national budgets.
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth.
In other countries, new drugs are not being reimbursed, and therefore don't reach patients.
In several countries, doctors and nurses are the targets, to some extent, for the governments.
After all, the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses.
You choose an expensive lab test, you choose to operate on an old and frail patient.
So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians, this is a way to hold costs down.
And ultimately, some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients.
"And so we took a step back and we said," What is it that we are trying to achieve? ""
We call this value-based healthcare.
This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.
On this picture, you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters.
You compare hospitals in a country, you'll find some that are extremely good, but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse.
The differences were dramatic.
You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot.
If he instead would go to Hamburg, and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik, the risk would be only one in 20.
But you and I don't know. We don't have the data.
And often, the data actually doesn't exist.
Nobody knows.
So going the hospital is a lottery.
Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope.
To the left of this slide, you see a variety of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip.
"" Oh, we should measure this. "" No, we should measure that. ""
And once they had agreed, they started measuring, and started sharing the data.
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense.
Since then, they publish every year.
Once a year, they publish the league table: who's best, who's at the bottom?
And they visit each other to try to learn, so a continuous cycle of improvement.
Now I found this principle really exciting.
So the physicians get together, they agree on what quality is, they start measuring, they share the data, they find who's best, and they learn from it.
Continuous improvement.
Now, that's not the only exciting part.
That's exciting in itself.
So if you look at the hip surgery story again, there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden.
We did a study where we looked at OECD data.
OECD does, every so often, look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries.
That's 20 percent of the budget, of the healthcare budget of the country.
We were always best in class.
But most of them don't know.
But physicians have another characteristic.
They actually thrive from peer recognition.
If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results, they will share.
They will share the information on how to improve.
So it is, by measuring and creating transparency, you get a cycle of continuous improvement, which is what this slide shows.
Now, you may say this is a nice idea, but this isn't only an idea.
This is happening in reality.
You may think that's a sneeze, but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement.
Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases, the year after, 16.
Why is that?
This particular day, we sat in a workshop together with physicians, nurses and other staff, discussing leukemia in children.
The group discussed, how do we measure quality today?
Can we measure it better than we do?
We discussed, how do we treat these kids, what are important improvements?
There was an enormous energy in the room.
There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.
"He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand, I forgot that — he raised his hand, clenched his fist, and then he said to the group," "Thank you."
Thank you.
I'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies succeed the most, what factors actually matter the most for startup success.
That's what I wanted to find out.
First, the idea.
I used to think that the idea was everything.
Some of our early successes, Citysearch, came out when people needed web pages.
GoTo.com, which we announced actually at TED in 1998, was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic.
Great idea, but unbelievable timing.
In fact, YouTube didn't even have a business model when it first started.
And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them.
Thank you very much, you've been a great audience.
(Applause)
I'm here to share my photography.
Or is it photography?
Because, of course, this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera.
Yet, my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15.
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a bit different, because using the camera, the process was in the planning instead.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the trigger.
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time.
I felt like anyone could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, something where the process starts when you press the trigger.
Photos like this: construction going on along a busy road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite that, it retains a level of realism.
Or photos like these — both dark and colorful, but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism.
When I say realism, I mean photo-realism.
Because, of course, it's not something you can capture really, but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph.
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick.
So it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really.
But what's the trick that makes it look realistic?
Is it something about the details or the colors?
Is it something about the light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really what is realistic, it's what we think looks realistic really.
So I think the basics are quite simple.
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality.
And let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects, something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional, like it could exist.
But at the same time, we know it can't.
So we trick our brains, because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process with combining photographs.
It's just really about combining different realities.
So the things that make a photograph look realistic, I think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives.
But when combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result.
As you can see, these images aren't really special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective.
Secondly, photos combined should have the same type of light.
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light.
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless.
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed.
So by matching color, contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images, adding photographic defects like depth of field, desaturated colors and noise, we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically.
So here's another example.
(Laughter) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated.
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations.
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head.
But it does require a lot of planning.
And getting this idea during winter, I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically.
So for example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish.
So to achieve a realistic result, I think it comes down to planning.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then it's about combining the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well planned.
And if you do a good job capturing the photos, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic.
So all the tools are out there, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome.
It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby, has, in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world's media combined.
Can that possibly be true?
Julian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?
It's a worry — isn't it? — that the rest of the world's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined.
CA: How does it work?
How do people release the documents?
And how do you secure their privacy?
JA: So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers, and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us.
So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails, pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections.
We get information in the mail, the regular postal mail, encrypted or not, vet it like a regular news organization, format it — which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do, when you're talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks.
CA: So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate, but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is?
JA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know, and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible.
(Phone ring) God damn it.
(Laughter) CA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership. (Laughter)
So let's take [an] example, actually.
This is something you leaked a few years ago.
If we can have this document up...
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened?
JA: So this is the Kroll Report.
This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004.
Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years.
He was a soft dictator of Kenya.
And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report, spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report.
And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi, who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya.
It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.
So I went there in 2007, and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election, December 28.
When we released that report, we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki, had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out, Daniel arap Moi, so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck.
CA: And — I mean, to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya, not from the official media, but indirectly, and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.
JA: Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya, in Tanzanian and South African press.
And so it came in from the outside.
And that, after a couple of days, made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV, shifted the vote by 10 percent, according to a Kenyan intelligence report, which changed the result of the election.
CA: Wow, so your leak really substantially changed the world?
JA: Yep.
(Applause) CA: Here's — We're going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video.
The video itself is longer, but here's a short clip.
This is — this is intense material, I should warn you.
Radio:... just fuckin ', once you get on' em just open 'em up.
I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along...
You're clear. All right. Firing.
Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.
Light 'em all up.
C'mon, fire!
(Machine gun fire) Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot' n. (Machine gun fire) Keep shoot 'n.
Hotel... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,
we need to move, time now!
All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.
Yeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.
Roger. I got 'em.
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.
Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on?
God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em.
CA: So, what was the impact of that?
JA: The impact on the people who worked on it was severe.
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story.
So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene.
CA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right, including two Reuters employees?
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees, two young children were wounded.
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together.
CA: And releasing this caused widespread outrage.
What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage, do you think?
JA: I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force.
You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street, and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded.
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full-time job.
CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, arrested, and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you, along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables.
I mean, did he?
JA: We have denied receiving those cables.
He has been charged, about five days ago, with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50.
Now, we had released, early in the year, a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy, but this is not necessarily connected.
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.
CA: I mean, if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables...
JA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?) JA: Yeah. (CA: Because?) JA: Well, because these sort of things reveal what the true state of, say, Arab governments are like, the true human-rights abuses in those governments.
If you look at declassified cables, that's the sort of material that's there.
CA: So let's talk a little more broadly about this.
I mean, in general, what's your philosophy?
Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information?
JA: Well, there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world, what sort of information can achieve reform.
And there's a lot of information.
So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing, that's a really good signal that when the information gets out, there's a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best, that know it from the inside out, are spending work to conceal it.
And that's what we've found in practice, and that's what the history of journalism is.
CA: But are there risks with that, either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large, where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence?
JA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released.
I mean, we have a harm immunization policy.
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it.
But there are legitimate secrets — you know, your records with your doctor; that's a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated.
CA: So they are well-motivated.
"And what would you say to, for example, the, you know, the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military, and he says," "You know what, you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out."
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying.
That gives the impression, has given the impression, to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.
"Actually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?" "What would you say to that?"
JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.
But remember, the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan — they don't need to see the video; they see it every day.
So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.
That's what they see every day.
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all, and that's our hope.
CA: So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.
Light is good.
But do you see any irony in the fact that, in order for you to shine that light, you have to, yourself, create secrecy around your sources?
JA: Not really. I mean, we don't have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet.
We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.
Should they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us, but we're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission, not to screw it up.
CA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far — I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.
You know, there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian.
You know, hero — people's hero — bringing this important light.
Dangerous troublemaker.
Who's got the hero view?
Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view?
JA: Oh, come on. There must be some.
CA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd.
We have to try better. Let's show them another example.
Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked, but I think for TED you are.
I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?
What is this?
JA: So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day.
So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania, like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, but not quite as big.
And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that, in fact, security guards from some rival, various competing oil firms had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.
And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it, so it was an extremely difficult document for us.
We couldn't verify it because we didn't know who wrote it and knew what it was about.
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.
"So under that basis, we put it out and said," "Look, we're skeptical about this thing."
We don't know, but what can we do?
"The material looks good, it feels right, but we just can't verify it." "And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it, wanting to track down the source — (Laughter) saying," "Hey, we want to track down the source." "And we were like," "Oh, tell us more."
What document is it, precisely, you're talking about?
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?
"Is it really yours?" "So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID."
Yeah.
(Applause) That's happened quite a lot though.
This is like one of our methods of identifying, of verifying, what a material is, is to try and get these guys to write letters.
CA: Yeah. Have you had information from inside BP?
JA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment, we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.
So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have.
That's a problem.
I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization, we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth, and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information.
CA: So that's the key bottleneck, basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries?
JA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people.
I mean, we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with, so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff, and then lower security cases.
CA: So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this.
And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools.
Can that be right?
JA: Well, my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult, so the combination between the two...
(Laughter) CA: I mean, a psychologist might say that's a recipe for breeding paranoia.
JA: What, the movie business?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: And you were also — I mean, you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on.
JA: Well, I was a journalist.
You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age.
I wrote a magazine, was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.
So you have to be careful with hacker.
I mean there's like — there's a method that can be deployed for various things.
Unfortunately, at the moment, it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.
So this phrase is not, not as nice as it used to be.
CA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account, but what about your core values?
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them?
JA: I'm not sure about the incident.
But the core values: well, capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims.
And that's something from my father and something from other capable, generous men that have been in my life.
CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims?
JA: Yeah. And you know, I'm a combative person, so I'm not actually so big on the nurture, but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims, which is to police perpetrators of crime.
And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time.
CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story: what happened in Iceland?
You basically published something there, ran into trouble with a bank, then the news service there was injuncted from running the story.
Instead, they publicized your side.
That made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next?
JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.
Iceland went through this financial crisis.
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world.
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy.
Anyway, so we release this report in July last year.
"And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air, like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk, and the news reader was like," This has never happened before. What do we do? ""
Well, we just show the website instead, for all that time, as a filler, and we became very famous in Iceland, went to Iceland and spoke about this issue.
And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again, and as a result, working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts, we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press, with the strongest journalistic protections in the world, with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech.
Iceland's a Nordic country, so, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.
And just a month ago, this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.
CA: Wow.
(Applause) Last question, Julian.
When you think of the future then, do you think it's more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control, more secrecy, or us watching Big Brother, or it's just all to be played for either way?
JA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go.
I mean, there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U., between China and the United States.
Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see.
That's why it's a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort, we can shift it one way or the other.
CA: Well, it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion to say, Julian, be careful, and all power to you.
JA: Thank you, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
"This little boy is looking up at his father, and he says," "Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a former president." "(Laughter) Well, I have had a great blessing as a former president, because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe."
Not only am I familiar with the 50 states in the United States, but also my wife and I have visited more than 145 countries in the world, and the Carter Center has had full-time programs in 80 nations on Earth.
So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights, and knowing the world as I do, I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is, strangely, not addressed quite often, is the abuse of women and girls.
(Applause) There are a couple of reasons for this that I'll mention to begin with.
First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures, holy scriptures, in the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, Quran and so forth, and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques.
And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God.
This is a very serious problem. It's ordinarily not addressed.
A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist, a Southern Baptist for 70 years — I tell you, I still teach Sunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well — but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position, a subservient position to men.
So they issued an edict, in effect, that prevents women from being priests, pastors, deacons in the church, or chaplains in the military, and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary, they cannot teach if a boy is in the room, because you can find verses in the Bible, there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible, that say that a woman shouldn't teach a man, and so forth.
But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position.
That is an all-pervasive problem, because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer, for instance, wants to cheat women, they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God, why should I treat them as equals myself?
The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence, and that is increasing tremendously around the world.
In the United States of America, for instance, we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people, mostly black people and minorities, by putting them in prison.
When I was in office as governor of Georgia, one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison.
Nowadays, 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison.
That's a sevenfold increase.
And since I left the White House, there's been an 800 percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison.
We also have [one of the only countries] on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country.
And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty.
We're in California now, and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convicting 13 people for the death penalty.
If you add that up, that's 307 million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed.
Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty, because it costs so much. (Applause) So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women.
Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most, and I'll be fairly brief, because I have a limited amount of time, as you know.
One is genital mutilation.
Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women, but in some countries, many countries, when a child is born that's a girl, very soon in her life, her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and, in a non-sterilized way, they remove the exterior parts of a woman's genitalia.
And sometimes, in more extreme cases but not very rare cases, they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate.
And then later, when she gets married, the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex.
This is not a rare thing, although it's against the law in most countries.
In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity.
This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries.
Another very serious thing is honor killings, where a family with misinterpretation, again, of a holy scripture — there's nothing in the Quran that mandates this — will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve, or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing.
And this is done by members of her own family, so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so-called disgrace to the family.
An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father, the uncle or the brother, but 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women.
Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery, or human trafficking it's called nowadays.
There were about 12.5 million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century.
There are 30 million people now living in slavery.
The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year, and the State Department reports that 800,000 people are sold across international borders every year into slavery, and that 80 percent of those sold are women, into sexual slavery.
In the United States right this moment, 60,000 people are living in human bondage, or slavery.
Atlanta, Georgia, where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University, they have between 200 and 300 women, people sold into slavery every month.
It's the number one place in the nation because of that.
Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world, and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere.
If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin, they can do it for 1,000 dollars.
A white-skinned girl brings several times more than that, and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about $35,000 per slave.
The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia.
So this is another very serious problem, and the basic problem is prostitution, because there's not a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials, the local policemen, or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth.
And this leads to one of the worst problems, and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world.
Sweden has got a good approach to it.
About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery, but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted, and — (Applause) — prostitution has gone down.
In the United States, we take just the opposite position.
For every male arrested for illegal sex trade, 25 women are arrested in the United States of America.
Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden, France, and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model.
That's another thing that can be done.
We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire: our military and our great university system.
In the military, they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place.
The last report I got, there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military — 26,000.
Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent, are actually prosecuted, and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization — a ship like my submarine, or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines — the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not, and of course, the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command, sexual assaults are taking place, so they do not do it.
That law needs to be changed.
About one out of four girls who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates, and this is now getting a lot of publicity, partially because of my book, but other things, and so 89 universities in America are now condemned by the Department of Education under Title IX because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault.
The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists, because outside of the university system, if they rape somebody, they'll be prosecuted, but when they get on a university campus, they can rape with impunity.
They're not prosecuted.
Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society.
These are the kind of things that go on.
If you take the Fortune 500 companies, 23 of them have women CEOs, out of 500, and those CEOs, I need not tell you, make less on an average than the other CEOs.
Well, that's what goes on in our country.
Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth.
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the Second World War.
Sometimes, we've had soldiers on the ground fighting.
The other times, we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people.
Other times, of course, now, we have drones that attack people and so forth.
We've been at war with 25 different countries or more since the Second World War.
There was four years, I won't say which ones, where we didn't — (Applause) — we didn't drop a bomb, we didn't launch a missile, we didn't fire a bullet.
But anyway, those kinds of things, the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes, are the basic causes, of abuse of women and girls.
There's one more basic cause that I need not mention, and that is that in general, men don't give a damn.
(Applause) That's true.
The average man that might say, I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy, and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child, when separate but equal had existed.
Racial discrimination, legally, had existed for 100 years, from 1865 at the end of the War Between the States, the Civil War, all the way up to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights.
But during that time, there were many white people that didn't think that racial discrimination was okay, but they stayed quiet, because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs, unique access to jury duty, better schools, and everything else, and that's the same thing that exists today, because the average man really doesn't care.
"Even though they say," "I'm against discrimination against girls and women," "they enjoy a privileged position."
So what is the basic thing that we need to do today?
The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth.
I didn't even go down to detail about that.
But I hope that out of this conference, that every woman here will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market, need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters.
I have 12 grandchildren, four children, and 10 great-grandchildren, and I think often about them and about the plight that they will face in America, not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country, in having equal rights, and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights.
Thank you very much.
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s, the future of the world was bleak.
The population explosion was unstoppable.
Global famine was inevitable.
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives.
The acid rain was falling on the forests.
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.
The oil was running out, and a nuclear winter would finish us off.
None of those things happened, (Laughter) and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime, the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet, in real terms, adjusted for inflation, has tripled.
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.
Child mortality is down by two-thirds.
Per-capita food production is up by a third.
And all this at a time when the population has doubled.
How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?
How did we achieve that?
How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous?
The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population, and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita.
I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine, to meet and, indeed, to mate.
In other words, you need to understand how ideas have sex.
I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this.
These are both real objects.
One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus.
The other is obviously a computer mouse.
They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.
I've tried to work out which is bigger, and it's almost impossible.
And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.
They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.
The differences are what interest me, because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations.
Of course there were a few changes, but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.
There was no progress, no innovation.
It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.
And there's another difference too, which is the object on the left is made from one substance.
The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances, from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.
And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas, the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser, the idea of transistors.
They've all been combined together in this technology.
And it's this combination, this cumulative technology, that intrigues me, because I think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world.
My body's an accumulation of ideas too: the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.
They've come together.
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?
Well, it uses sexual reproduction.
In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures, a green one and a red one, then one has to be better than the other.
One goes extinct for the other to survive.
But if you have a sexual species, then it's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages.
So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species.
It's not confined to its own lineage.
What's the process that's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution?
And I think the answer is exchange, the habit of exchanging one thing for another.
It's a unique human feature.
No other animal does it.
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens.
"As Adam Smith said," "No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog." "(Laughter) You can have culture without exchange."
You can have, as it were, asexual culture.
Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.
They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring.
In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks.
But the difference is that these cultures never expand, never grow, never accumulate, never become combinatorial, and the reason is because there is no sex, as it were, there is no exchange of ideas.
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.
There's no exchange of ideas between them.
And why does exchange raise living standards?
Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.
And here is a Stone Age version of his story, although he told it in terms of trade between countries.
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.
He doesn't need Adam.
He can make his own spears and axes.
Well no, because if you think about it, if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes, and then they trade, then they will each have saved an hour of work.
And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be, because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears.
So the gains from trade are only going to grow.
And this is one of the beauties of exchange, is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization, which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time.
That is prosperity, the saving of time in satisfying your needs.
Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.
You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.
How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you're on the average wage in Britain today?
And the answer is about half a second.
Back in 1950, you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light.
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since 1950, as it were, because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else, or you can acquire another good or service.
And back in 1880, it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage.
Back in 1800, you'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour.
In other words, the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800.
"Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse, and ask yourself:" "Who made them and for who?" "The stone axe was made by someone for himself."
It was self-sufficiency.
We call that poverty these days.
But the object on the right was made for me by other people.
How many other people?
Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?
You know, I think it's probably millions.
Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee, which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig, who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.
They were all working for me, to make a mouse for me.
And that's the way society works.
That's what we've achieved as a species.
In the old days, if you were rich, you literally had people working for you.
That's how you got to be rich; you employed them.
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him.
They made his silly outfits, like this, (Laughter) and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.
He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night.
But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV's pictures, he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.
They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris, and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal that's probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had.
And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.
We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other's living standards.
Now, you do get other animals working for each other too.
Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.
But there's a big difference, which is that it only happens within the colony.
There's no working for each other across the colonies.
And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.
That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.
The queen does it all.
In our species, we don't like doing that.
It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.
(Laughter) Even in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.
(Applause) So when did this habit start?
And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?
Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor.
But I've got no evidence for that.
It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male.
In all hunter-gatherer societies today, there's a foraging division of labor between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.
It isn't always quite that simple, but there's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females.
And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides.
The woman knows that, in the Hadzas' case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.
And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog.
And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging to get roots.
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it's big enough to share some.
And so both sides raise each other's standards of living through the sexual division of labor.
When did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible that Neanderthals didn't do this.
They were a highly cooperative species.
They were a highly intelligent species.
Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine in this room today.
They were imaginative. They buried their dead.
They had language, probably, because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us, which was discovered here in Oxford.
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.
They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.
But there's no evidence of a sexual division of labor.
There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.
And the other thing there's no evidence for is exchange between groups, because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains, the tools they made, are always made from local materials.
For example, in the Caucasus there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.
They're always made from local chert.
In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date, 30,000 years ago, and some of those are from local chert, but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away.
And when human beings began moving objects around like this, it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.
Trade is 10 times as old as farming.
People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.
Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years.
And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa, when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia.
You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria.
And that's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups.
And that will have led to specialization.
How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration?
Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals, who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa, which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.
They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs, and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia.
So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade, not migration.
What happens when you cut people off from exchange, from the ability to exchange and specialize?
And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress, you can actually throw it into reverse.
An example is Tasmania.
When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago, the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland, they actually experienced regress.
They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had.
It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.
How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years?
It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island, similar people.
The reason: because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight, and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years.
The Tasmanians were isolated.
Go back to this image again and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who, but who knew how to make it.
In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.
But who knows how to make a computer mouse?
Nobody, literally nobody.
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.
I mean this quite seriously.
The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.
He just knows how to run a company.
The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.
We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.
"I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s, called" "I, Pencil" "in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made, and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil, because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite, and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing."
And what we've done in human society, through exchange and specialization, is we've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand.
It's not the same with language.
With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other.
But with technology, we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.
We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree.
And by the way, that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q., about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.
It's completely irrelevant.
What's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas, and how well they're cooperating, not how clever the individuals are.
So we've created something called the collective brain.
We're just the nodes in the network.
We're the neurons in this brain.
It's the interchange of ideas, the meeting and mating of ideas between them, that is causing technological progress, incrementally, bit by bit.
However, bad things happen.
And in the future, as we go forward, we will, of course, experience terrible things.
There will be wars; there will be depressions; there will be natural disasters.
Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.
But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making, and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before, I'm also sure that technology will advance, and therefore living standards will advance.
Because through the cloud, through crowd sourcing, through the bottom-up world that we've created, where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate, we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My name is Amit.
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google, and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it.
And it took 18 months.
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide, and it's access.
And I grew up in India.
I had a great education — I'm not complaining — but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums, I started learning a lot.
And while working at Google, I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this.
I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch.
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
You look around at all these museums here.
You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA, the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
Two ways of going in — very simple.
Click and, bang, you're in this museum.
It doesn't matter where you are — Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.
You move around, you have fun.
You want to navigate around the museum?
Open the plan up, and, in one click, jump.
You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.
Keep going. Have fun.
Explore.
(Applause) Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.
"(Laughter) So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings," "The Harvesters" "by Pieter Bruegel at the Met."
I see this plus sign.
If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.
Now this is one of the images.
So this is all of the meta-data information.
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this — but I'm going to click this off right now.
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology.
So this image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.
"And I get a lot of people asking me:" What do you get for 10 billion pixels? ""
So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.
You can zoom around very simply.
You see some fun stuff happening here.
I love this guy; his expression is priceless.
But then you really want to go deep.
And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here.
"And I was like," "Hold on. That sounds interesting." "Went in, and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something."
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, and actually found out that this is a game called squall, which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday.
And apparently it was quite popular.
I don't know why they did it, but I learned something about it.
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.
Now just to give you some perspective, I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
(Applause) The best is yet to come — so in a second.
So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, again in New York.
"So another one of my favorites," "The Starry Night." "Now the example I showed you was all about finding details."
But what if you want to see brush strokes?
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
You zoom in. You really go in.
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
"This is" "The Starry Night," "I think, never seen like this before."
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.
Any one of you, anybody — doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor, if you have a fancy house — doesn't matter.
You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images.
Very simply, you go in — and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around.
"This is" "The Ambassadors," "based in the National Gallery."
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces.
So I think, in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.
It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.
I probably shouldn't say that.
It really comes from these artists.
And that's been my humbling experience in this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online.
"And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is," "Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?" "And the answer is no."
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
We do achieve more in game worlds.
So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.
And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.
Five million people use it every month.
That's the problem that I'm trying to solve.
His work is brilliant.
But it is not, by any means, an optimal situation.
We have to start making the real world work more like a game.
Before we had awesome game controllers, we had sheep's knuckles.
People were suffering. People were fighting.
This is really exciting.
According to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better, so the king decided they would play one final dice game.
We want to imagine epic wins, and then give people the means to achieve the epic win.
We made this game in 2007.
This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.
We've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up in skills like local insight, knowledge networking, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us.
And my little idea that will do that is sleep.
(Laughter) (Applause) This is a room of type-A women. This is a room
of sleep-deprived women.
And I learned the hard way, the value of sleep.
Two-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion.
I hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye.
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep.
And in the course of that, I studied, I met with medical doctors, scientists, and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life is getting enough sleep.
(Applause) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue.
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because unfortunately for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before.
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn't say it — I felt like saying," "You know what?"
"If you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting." "(Laughter) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship."
"Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date, and you say," "How about eight o'clock?" "they're likely to tell you," "Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's okay, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight." "And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive, but the truth is they're not, because we, at the moment, have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible decisions."
So a high I.Q.
does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic.
And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics.
In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around.
(Applause) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture.
So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world.
So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us, to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Well, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain, the functions and structure of the human brain.
And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.
Here is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand, and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity.
And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness, which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology, and hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens.
OK, so how do you study this mysterious organ?
I mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells, little wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other, and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness.
How does this happen?
Well, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain.
One approach, the one we use mainly, is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain, where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain.
What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities, a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.
What you get is a highly selective loss of one function, with other functions being preserved intact, and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function.
So you can then map function onto structure, and then find out what the circuitry's doing to generate that particular function.
So that's what we're trying to do.
So let me give you a few striking examples of this.
In fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.
If you look at the first slide there, that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK — the lobes that constitute the brain.
And if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you can't see it there — is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.
And that's been called the face area in the brain, because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.
"You can still recognize them from their voice and say," "Oh yeah, that's Joe," "but you can't look at their face and know who it is, right?"
You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror.
I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks, and you know it's a mirror, but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself.
OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus.
But there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact, that very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.
"This is called the Capgras delusion, and that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal, has had a head injury, comes out of coma, otherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother and says," "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman, but she's an impostor."
"She's some other woman pretending to be my mother." "Now, why does this happen?"
Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects, but when he sees his mother, his delusion kicks in and says, it's not mother.
Now, the most common interpretation of this, which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks, is a Freudian view, and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women, by the way, but I'll just talk about guys.
When you're a little baby, a young baby, you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.
This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.
I'm not saying I believe this, but this is the standard Freudian view.
And then, as you grow up, the cortex develops, and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.
Thank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.
And then what happens is, there's a blow to your head, damaging the cortex, allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge, flaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.
"And you say," "My God, if this is my mom, how come I'm being sexually turned on?"
"She's some other woman. She's an impostor." "It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain."
This has never made much sense to me, this argument.
It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are — (Laughter) — but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion, a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle. (Laughter)
"He'll say," "Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi, but it's some other dog." "Right?"
Now, you try using the Freudian explanation there.
(Laughter) You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans, or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.
Now, what's really going on?
So, to explain this curious disorder, we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.
Normally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs, go to the visual areas in the brain.
There are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision, and after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.
You can call it the face area of the brain, right?
I talked about that earlier.
Now, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right?
But from that area, the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system, the emotional core of the brain, and that structure, called the amygdala, gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.
Is it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate?
Or is it something absolutely trivial, like a piece of lint, or a piece of chalk, or a — I don't want to point to that, but — or a shoe, or something like that? OK?
Which you can completely ignore.
So if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important, the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.
Your heart starts beating faster.
You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to create from muscular exertion.
And that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.
So I can determine, when you're looking at something, whether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?
And I'll get to that in a minute.
So my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his — any object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and, however, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus, and you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table, or your mother, for that matter, OK?
And then the message cascades into the amygdala, and then goes down the autonomic nervous system.
But maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system, the emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.
"So because the fusiform is intact, the chap can still recognize his mother, and says," "Oh yeah, this looks like my mother." "But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers, he says," "But how come, if it's my mother, I don't experience a warmth?" "Or terror, as the case may be? Right?"
"(Laughter) And therefore, he says," "How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions?"
This can't be my mother.
"It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother." "How do you test this?"
Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen, and measure your galvanic skin response, and show pictures on the screen, I can measure how you sweat when you see an object, like a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.
If I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?
And, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother — I'm talking about normal people — you start sweating.
You don't even have to be Jewish.
(Laughter) Now, what happens if you show this patient?
You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response.
Tables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people, but when you show him a picture of his mother, the galvanic skin response is flat.
There's no emotional reaction to his mother, because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.
So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal, his emotions are normal — he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.
It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do: take a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong, that, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain.
"By the way, if this patient then goes, and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone, and he says," "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?" "There's no delusion through the phone."
"Then, she approaches him after an hour, he says," "Who are you?"
"You look just like my mother." "OK?"
The reason is there's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers, and that's not been cut by the accident.
So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.
When he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.
OK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain?
Is it nature, genes, or is it nurture?
And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.
And you all know what a phantom limb is.
When an arm is amputated, or a leg is amputated, for gangrene, or you lose it in war — for example, in the Iraq war, it's now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm, and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg.
In fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.
Believe it or not, even with internal viscera.
I've had patients with the uterus removed — hysterectomy — who have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month.
"And in fact, one student asked me the other day," Do they get phantom PMS? ""
(Laughter) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that.
OK, now the next question is, what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?
One of the things we've found was, about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom.
It'll pat his brother on the shoulder, it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.
These are very compelling, vivid sensations.
The patient's not delusional.
He knows that the arm is not there, but, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.
But however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.
"The phantom limb — they'll say," "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed."
It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.
"If only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved." "Now, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?"
It sounds like an oxymoron.
But when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was, these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs, the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.
The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed, was cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.
So the patient had an actual arm, which is painful, in a sling for a few months or a year, and then, in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm, the surgeon amputates the arm, and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right?
And this is a serious clinical problem.
Patients become depressed.
Some of them are driven to suicide, OK?
So, how do you treat this syndrome?
Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?
When I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm, and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut, and the actual arm had been paralyzed, and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation, and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.
Why does this happen?
"When the arm was intact, but paralyzed, the brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying," "Move," "but it's getting visual feedback saying," "No." "Move. No. Move. No. Move. No."
And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain, and we call this learned paralysis, OK?
The brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link, that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.
And then, when you've amputated the arm, this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom, OK?
Now, how do you help these patients?
How do you unlearn the learned paralysis, so you can relieve him of this excruciating, clenching spasm of the phantom arm?
Well, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom, but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right?
Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.
How do you do that? Well, virtual reality.
But that costs millions of dollars.
So, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars, but don't tell my funding agencies.
(Laughter) OK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.
You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle, and then you put the phantom — so my first patient, Derek, came in.
He had his arm amputated 10 years ago.
He had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.
He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.
It was a paralyzed phantom arm.
So he came there, and I gave him a mirror like that, in a box, which I call a mirror box, right?
And the patient puts his phantom left arm, which is clenched and in spasm, on the left side of the mirror, and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror, and makes the same posture, the clenched posture, and looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience?
He looks at the phantom being resurrected, because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror, and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.
"" "Now," "I said," "now, look, wiggle your phantom — your real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror." "He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving, right?"
"That's obvious, but the astonishing thing is, the patient then says," "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again, and the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved." "And remember, my first patient who came in — (Applause) — thank you. (Applause) My first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror, and I said," "Look at your reflection of your phantom." "And he started giggling, he says," "I can see my phantom." "But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real."
He knows it's a mirror reflection, but it's a vivid sensory experience.
"Now, I said," "Move your normal hand and phantom." "He said," "Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful." "I said," "Move your normal hand." "And he says," "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this!"
"And my pain is being relieved." "OK?"
"And then I said," "Close your eyes." "He closes his eyes."
"" And move your normal hand. ""
"" Oh, nothing. It's clenched again. ""
"" OK, open your eyes. ""
"" Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again! ""
So, he was like a kid in a candy store.
So, I said, OK, this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input, but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb.
(Laughter) (Applause) It's a completely useless ability, if you think about it. (Laughter)
But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this, which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror.
"So, I said," "Look, Derek" "— well, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said," "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two."
"Maybe, after a period of practice, you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis, and start moving your paralyzed arm, and then, relieve yourself of pain." "So he said OK, and he took it home."
"I said," "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home." "So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me, and he said," "Doctor, you're not going to believe this." "I said," "What?" "He said," "It's gone." "I said," "What's gone?" "I thought maybe the mirror box was gone."
"(Laughter) He said," "No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years?"
"It's disappeared." "And I said — I got worried, I said, my God, I mean I've changed this guy's body image, what about human subjects, ethics and all of that?"
"And I said," "Derek, does this bother you?" "He said," "No, last three days, I've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching, no phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away."
"But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder, and your box doesn't reach." "(Laughter)" "So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead, so I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?" "He thought I was some kind of magician."
Now, why does this happen?
It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.
It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.
On the other hand, there's no proprioception, muscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?
And your motor command saying there is an arm, and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it, there is no phantom, there is no arm, right?
It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals.
And when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.
So, that's the bonus.
Now, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki, so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain, and indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.
Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers, nothing you can do about it.
But, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis, and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.
This has also gone through clinical trials, helping lots and lots of patients.
OK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk, which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.
This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.
He pointed out that certain people in the population, who are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity: every time they see a number, it's colored.
Five is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse, nine is indigo, OK?
Bear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.
Or C sharp — sometimes, tones evoke color.
C sharp is blue, F sharp is green, another tone might be yellow, right?
Why does this happen?
This is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia, a mingling of the senses.
In us, all the senses are distinct.
These people muddle up their senses.
Why does this happen?
One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.
Synesthesia runs in families, so Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis.
Secondly, synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists and other creative people than in the general population.
Why would that be?
I'm going to answer that question.
It's never been answered before.
OK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?
Well, there are many theories.
One theory is they're just crazy.
Now, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.
Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?
Now, there may be some truth to this, because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego.
(Laughter) OK. Now, the third theory is that — well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right?
So, we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.
So we said, there's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain.
So, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color, and that's why you get synesthesia.
Now remember — why does this happen?
Why would there be crossed wires in some people?
Remember I said it runs in families?
That gives you the clue.
And that is, there is an abnormal gene, a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring.
In all of us, it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else.
So, every brain region is wired to every other region, and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain.
So, if there's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates, then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.
And if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.
If it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.
So far, so good.
Now, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain, so everything is cross-connected?
"Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common, the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking, linking seemingly unrelated ideas, such as," "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun." "Well, you don't say, Juliet is the sun, does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire?"
I mean, schizophrenics do that, but it's a different story, right?
Normal people say, she's warm like the sun, she's radiant like the sun, she's nurturing like the sun.
Instantly, you've found the links.
Now, if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain, then it's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia.
And, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets, artists and novelists.
OK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.
The last demonstration — can I take one minute?
(Applause) OK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes, but you're in denial about it.
Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet, A is A, B is B, C is C.
Different shapes for different phonemes, right?
Here, you've got Martian alphabet.
One of them is Kiki, one of them is Bouba.
Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba?
How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Bouba? Raise your hands.
Well, it's one or two mutants.
(Laughter) How many of you think that's Bouba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.
Ninety-nine percent of you.
Now, none of you is a Martian. How did you do that?
It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction, meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection — ki-ki, in your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited — Kiki, mimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.
Now, this is very important, because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it's just — it looks like a silly illusion, but these photons in your eye are doing this shape, and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern, but the brain is able to extract the common denominator.
It's a primitive form of abstraction, and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain, because when that's damaged, these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki, but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor.
"If you ask this guy, what —" "all that glitters is not gold," "what does that mean?" "The patient says," "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold."
"You have to measure its specific gravity, OK?" "So, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning."
So, this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates.
Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus, because it's the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch, and it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on.
And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction, metaphor and creativity.
All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia, we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging, and by studying patients and asking the right questions.
Thank you.
(Applause) Sorry about that.
(Laughter)
This story is about taking imagination seriously.
Fourteen years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries.
Today, I'm using it to create permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world.
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.
I never studied sculpture, engineering or architecture.
In fact, after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven.
I went off on my own to become an artist, and I painted for 10 years, when I was offered a Fulbright to India.
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings, I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.
The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn't.
I had to do something.
This fishing village was famous for sculpture.
So I tried bronze casting.
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.
I went for a walk on the beach, watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.
I'd seen it every day, but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture, a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials.
My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen.
"It's a self-portrait titled" "Wide Hips." "(Laughter) We hoisted them on poles to photograph."
I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns.
I was mesmerized.
I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans, next in Lithuania with lace makers.
I liked the fine detail it gave my work, but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in.
Returning to India to work with those fishermen, we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid.
Thousands of people saw it, and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto, Portugal.
He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city.
I didn't know if I could do that and preserve my art.
Durable, engineered, permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.
For two years, I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays, salt, air, pollution, and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind.
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle.
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.
We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds.
But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving.
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel.
He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement.
I couldn't build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane.
So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory, learned the variables of their machines, and figured out a way to make lace with them.
There was no language to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce.
So we had to create one.
Three years and two children later, we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built, permanent and had lost nothing in translation.
(Applause) This intersection had been bland and anonymous.
Now it had a sense of place.
I walked underneath it for the first time.
As I watched the wind's choreography unfold, I felt sheltered and, at the same time, connected to limitless sky.
My life was not going to be the same.
I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world.
I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work.
Historic Philadelphia City Hall: its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting.
So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing, discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet.
I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.
Next challenge, the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked, could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture?
(Laughter) I didn't know where to begin, but I said yes.
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean.
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates, sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day.
So I contacted NOAA, and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami, and translated it into this.
"Its title:" "1.26" "refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth's day was shortened."
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.
Its shape was too complex now.
So I replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.
The sculpture could now be entirely soft, which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.
There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity.
So we had to create it.
Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line.
This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers.
They don't have funding yet, but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed.
Fourteen years ago, I searched for beauty in the traditional things, in craft forms.
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous, billowing forms the scale of buildings.
My artistic horizons continue to grow.
I'll leave you with this story.
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.
An attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art, never visited the local art museum, dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.
There they were in their business suits, laying in the grass, noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know, sharing the rediscovery of wonder.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.
After puberty, we fall off the map.
She's a six-monther.
(Applause)
I essentially became an infant in a woman's body.
If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another.
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.
Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like and what it sounds like.
I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere.
And in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful.
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere, is a very different place.
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.
And our left hemisphere thinks in language.
And all I could detect was this energy — energy.
"And I'm asking myself," "What is wrong with me?"
And I felt lighter in my body.
