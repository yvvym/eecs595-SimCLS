on in the bot lane during the early game.", "there are many possible combinations for the bot lane and it's important for the bot lane to work together.", "the problems i have with this is, because of the fact that supports make up almost 90% of the plays at bot lane (unless you're a janna and even she has to make counterplays), i feel like the bot lane is more dependent on the skill of the support than the adc.", "adcs have weak early games, it's why they have supports to begin with.", "because adcs only scale harder into late game with expensive items and they need as much cs as possible, they require the vision control and the safety that supports provide them in the early game to make a transition into the mid game and eventually, the late game as safely as possible.", "the complaints that i have been hearing very often from diamond 1/challenger players when they lose games are mostly about the bot lane, which to me makes sense.", "because of the fact that the bot lane requires synergy and a bot lane for a solo queue game most likely don't have this unless they're a duo, it seems to have the most impact for which team wins, because at that elo, mid, top, and jungle all know how to play properly.", "synergy is so important for bot lane that without it, the lane is lost.", "i just find it very annoying that i have to be so reliant on the actions of my support and not what i do.", "i.e.", "i'm varus, my suppport is nami against janna/trist.", "on paper, assuming without jungle interference, we should win or at least come out slightly ahead since we have a lot more kill potential early on.", "in game, it'd be totally different because people don't land skillshots etc.", "sure, one might say then just don't try to trade if you can't follow up.", "the problem with that?", "that means adcs with bad early games, like tristana or vayne, can transition into the mid game even faster.", "if you can't punish these adcs with terrible early games, they just become better as the game goes on.", "not only is it frustrating to deal with supports who don't understand how important their role actually is, but it's also annoying when they have some of the biggest potential to throw the game as well.", "i can't count how many times i have gotten an early 3/0 lead in the game with the help of some good ganks as well as following up on the plays my support initiates but still transition into mid game terribly because from that point on, my support would get caught by the enemy bot lane while i'm not there.", "2. minimal ability to control the game

the most damage in team fights.", "great.", "except the problem is, precisely because of this fact, i feel so limited in what i can do to help my team.", "i can't splitpush (unless the enemy adc is

right now: they offer the most damage in team fights to definitively help your team come out ahead.", "don't get me wrong, i'm not saying i don't like team fights, but i wish i could do more as as adc than just being there to do the most damage in team fights.", "at least mid and top can put pressure on the map easily since some can run tp and some have global abilities.", "i have won games where my team 4v5s while my mid/top puts pressure across the map, which feels great and all but is that really only what an adc is supposed to do?", "3. it is incredibly hard to stay consistent   i don't wanna confuse anyone when i bring this point up.", "yes, i would think it's hard for any role to stay consistent.", "there are so many factors in the game that it would be impossible to try to play consistently to account for each and every single one.", "but i feel for adc, there is so much more room for inconsistency to pile up and for mistakes to be made.", "the most obvious would be how your support performs in lane.", "another is how good your positioning is in team fights.", "the higher and higher you get in solo queue, the more and more difficult it is to team fight, because people know how to focus better and choose better team compositions to try to shut you down.", "4. the blatant imbalance between blue and purple   i'll be honest, i'm guilty of abusing blue side whenever i can.", "but the fact this imbalance exists really troubles me a lot.", "before the golems change, people would just take double golems on blue side and gain an early advantage that you had to pray they took a lot of damage from golems so you can fight back.", "even after they changed the spawn time, you can still do golems from blue side and miss at most 3 cs if you do them properly.", "(but wait, yunsang, that means if they miss 3 cs, you're ahead aren't you?)", "well, they can still get the early lvl 2 advantage because golems provide more xp.", "this still needs a serious change.", "bottom line   a lot of people who post here might think i'm just qqing, but after playing this game for around 2-3 years as an adc main, the role has recently felt incredibly hard and stressful to play.", "i don't know what games i'm going to get a decent support and even if i do, i'm still confined to staying with the team at all times during mid/late game for teamfights.", "please don't get me wrong, i'm not one of those players who blames the team for the loss.", "when it comes to bot lane though, having the better support makes a huge difference since supports are the true playmakers of the bot lane and i think a lot of people don't realize that.", "i cry tears of joy when i have good synergy with my support, because it feels awesome making good plays, but it seems like not many
