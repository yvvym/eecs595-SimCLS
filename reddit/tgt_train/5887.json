really understand her side.", "that clarify began to fade as the days went on.", "i can't explain it, but the sadness and confusion and frustration stared reemerging in my mind, almost literally pushing out that feeling of clarity.", "it got to the point, a few days later, that i stared crying again in a fit of confusion.", "how could she do this to me?", "that same night i came home and walked in on her face timing the guy she slept with.", "she was playing on her new xbox one and he was watching her game, nothing really weird or terrible.", "but i was absolutely furious.", "i walked out silently without looking at her.", "took a shower and was just angry the entire time.", "how could she talk to him after everything that has happened?", "how could she not understand that simply seeing them talk was enough to set me off?", "it was disrespectful, it was childish.", "i felt like she was playing a game with me and that she never ever really cared about my feelings.", "that the crying from the other night was a bunch of bullshit.", "these were just some of the feelings going through my head.", "when i got out of the shower she tried to talk to me about a show on netflix and i told her i didn't care what she had to say.", "i stormed out.", "again, i'm not usually so over emotional, but the situation just leaves me feeling confused, scared and angry.", "all these feelings mix to make me more confused, scared and angry.", "that night we got into a huge argument.", "i told her what i thought and she told me she just felt like she was talking to a friend and that i should understand that.", "the guy was just a friend to her and she talked to her online friends all the time.", "this was \"literally nothing different.\"", "i told her she was inconsiderate towards my feelings.", "she knew i was still really hurt and that she shouldn't talk to him, especially not right in front of me.", "i told her in my eyes, this guy is no longer just a friend of yours.", "he's the guy you slept with, the guy who hurt me, and even though i didn't know him and even though i completely understood why he did what he did, i couldn't help but utterly hate him.", "yet, in her

goes back to normal and it's like nothing happened.", "i find it funny that we can so completely disagree.", "my life was completely flipped upside down, while hers was just a fun few nights away from the problem that is me.", "again, information that makes me sad.", "i go from furious to depressed pretty quickly at this point.", "i really hate these crazy emotions.", "she tells me i'm being illogical and that i should remember the really great conversation we had the other night.", "it was one of the best conversations we ever had because for once we actually understood each other.", "so she says she isn't sure if she believes i really want to be her friend.", "i tell her i really care about her and that of course i do, but that i just need time to work through everything in my head.", "that she knows i'm not so volitle.", "she tells me she thinks i'm going crazy and that she isn't sure if she can trust me anymore.", "i'm on the verge of tears again so i tell her something i had been holding in for a long time.", "i tell her that just because i was never ready to say the words \"i love you\" doesn't mean the feelings weren't there.", "i tell her i know i can't force her to feel how i want her to feel, that i can't control how she feels or who she talks to, but that i wish i could.", "not being able to do that is what makes me so emotional, because i desperately want her to feel a certain way.", "she tells me she understand and that she knows she can't get me to feel a certain way.", "she tells me she feels like she's fighting a losing battle.", "we both say we literally have no idea how to proceed.", "the anger fades, but the sadness remains when we finally go to bed.", "there was some clarity again from that argument, but at a much higher cost.", "the next night isn't so bad.", "we joke and things seem okay.", "she lays on her chest and i give her a back rub.", "we end up having sex.", "i should note that over the past few days, i had gone on tinder in an effort to get over her by taking to other girls.", "i even started talking to pretty girls randomly throughout my day.", "nothing serious, just casual flirting.", "i met one really cute girl on tinder and we kind of hit it off.", "i was excited.", "i really don't want a girlfriend but it felt good to flirt with a pretty girl.", "she gave me her number.", "anyway, after me and jane had sex, we were preparing for round 2. i really wanted to do it again, but like an idiot, i looked down at my phone that was at the edge of the bed where i had left it.", "i noticed a text from tinder girl, so i picked it up to respond quickly and get back to the sex.", "jane saw this and became immediately suspicious.", "the mood was utterly killed in its tracks.", "she kept asking me what i was doing with my phone and i felt like i had just been caught cheating.", "i should mention that jane has been encouraging that i talk to other girls for a really long time.", "i was actually following her advice here, but i felt like i was caught doing something dirty.", "like i was playing with 2 girls at the same time.", "i admit, i was excited to talk to the tinder girl.", "but i was even more excited by sex with jane, which is why i really don't get why i picked up my phone in the first place.", "i ended up telling jane i was looking up a porno to help get me in the mood for round 2.   jane left the room and cleaned up.", "when she came back she said she doesn't think she wants to have sex with me anymore.", "she was angry but didn't come out and say why.", "she felt like it was becoming a waste of time and that she couldn't trust me.", "i could tell she was not going to be convinced otherwise at the current moment so i figured i should leave her alone.", "i told her i would make her food for lunch the next day, but she said not to because she couldn't trust me anymore.", "i told her again, i was looking for a porno and she said that might be true, but that in her mind i was taking pictures of her during sex because i was bitter and resentful.", "that i would use those pictures to blackmail her.", "i would never do that.", "i already have some home made picture and videos of me and jane and i would never in my life share them with anyone no matter how mad i was.", "let me explain.", "my first big love on high school cheated on me and she had sent me loads of dirty pictures that i saved on my computer.", "a few months after the break up, i actually went and deleted all of them permanently out of respect for her.", "i would never do something so cruel to someone like \"girlfriend revenge\" i'm just not that kind of person.", "i'm actually decent friends with that ex in a completely platonic way now.", "anyway, that brings us to today.", "my family isn't big on holidays so i'm spending thanksgiving with her family - somethings we agreed to weeks ago.", "we haven't argued and have actually joked around quite a bit.", "i'm still not over everything but i'm trying to come to terms with her views in order to make good on my promise to be her friend.", "i'd still like to have sex with her, even though i probably should stop, but what really worries me is that she thinks i am not trustworthy.", "ever since i went through her phone in my moment of paranoia, she thinks i'm going to do it again.", "i assure her i have no interest in seeing who she talks to, mostly because if i see her talking dirty to that guy again, i'll likely flip out.", "i personally haven't spoken to tinder girl and she seems to have no interest in talking to me.", "i'm fine with that cause i would rather focus on jane and our friendship.", "i want to be her good friend.", "i want to repair the broken bond, even if it isn't romantic.", "i want to

highlights:     how can we repair our broken friendship and trust, while getting rid of previous resentment?", "i truly believe that we are both good people that care about each other, but somehow

friendship to remain.", "i know i am severely flawed in many ways, but i am extremely committed to bettering myself.", "i'm actually looking into self help books and such.", "my greatest desire is to

dropping my ass when i kept trying to be in a relationship.", "finally, how can i fall out of love with her?", "i want to no longer love her in a romantic way.", "i know i will likely always love her
