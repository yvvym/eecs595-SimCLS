was 17 for a few incidents, but also regardless of age he should not be doing any of this without consent, and there clearly was never any consent given.", "i explained that just because we don't explicitly tell him to fuck off when he does these things, it's not because we want it, it's because as women we learn to minimise possible aggression that may occur and so we don't make a scene, so

leave, but unfortunately the president of the club (another man) insists that it's constitutionally a thing that we need to give him another chance.", "and finally, he and emily had some contention
