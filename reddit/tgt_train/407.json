{"article": ["so months ago i introduce this girl maggie to my closest friends, john and al... pls note that i was not and are still currently not in a relationship with maggie   so they kicked it off and we started hanging out together... sometimes it would be \"me, al and maggie,\" sometimes \"al, john and maggie,\" sometime even \"me, al, maggie, john and his wife sheila,\" sometimes just john and maggie   to me that last one was not a problem, but recently i found out that when they did hang out, john would not tell his wife about it... at first i didn't really think it was a big of a deal coz everytime he hangs out with just the guys he would also kinda lie so he could come home a bit late... then al pointed out that there were hints that i missed when we hang out (coz i was so into her) that john is doing his moves on her, i then slowly beginning to notice it too   now i need to say this, since long ago us 3 have a silent bond that all's fair in love and war... meaning there is no dibs mentality between us... if who he gets the girl then he gets the girl (this was way before john was married)... no problem no qualms... back in the day some of the girls al brought to hang even went out with me instead, some of the ladies john brought to hang ended up with al and so forth... if the girl ends a relationship with any one of us the usually we drift of...  now not to be a hypocrite i do admit that it does hurts when john does that but that's how we are and it's worked for us so far   here is  the main problem  i'm facing... combined with the already bruised ego that i'm getting, i am having this huge guilt trip for maybe potentially ruining a marriage coz i was the one who introduce maggie to the gang... for god sakes i know john's wife personally... they have a kid that from time to time i babysit... now i don't know all the details but i can say that nothing physical is going between them... yet but the emotional affair and the wife lying is killing me inside and she has yet to find out about it...   so reddit what do i do, do i tell sheila about it and come off like a dick and might potentially ruin their marriage or do i just tell john about it (though the thing is he doesn't know that i know about them hanging out together... i got the info from al and i then verified it) and still come off as a jealous ass and potentially ruin years of friendship with him, do i confront maggie and again come off as a jealous dick and ruin a good thing with her... also maggie doesn't know that john lies to his wife when they both hang out together, she just assumes that sheila knows   what advise do you have for me on how to handle the situation?", "i would not have this problem if it was al instead since he is still single like me"],
