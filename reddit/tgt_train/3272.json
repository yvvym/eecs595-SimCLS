{"article": ["this happened like 2 years ago, i was friends with a stoner (pretty laid back guy), we would occasionally hang out at school, or outside of school, well one day, he asked if i could stay over at his house, i happily agreed, i asked my parents were fine with it, but had to talk to the parents, they talked and i was allowed to stay over, we go through the day, not doing anything bad, until like 1 am, he asked us (also one other kid a little older than me stayed over) if we wanted to go smoke some marijuanas, before anything else he didn't pressure me, i thought about it and said yea, i was trying not to act like a pansy, (which i should of in order to not create the future events that were going to happen) his dealer lived a couple streets down, so we tool a shortcut not to get caught by the mps (military police, i'm a military child) it was a success, we made it, smoked a little, and headed back to my friends place.", "so fast forward to the next day, i ask to stay over again, my parents are fine with it, so are his, and the other kid parents, his dealer was suppose to go get some more marijuanas, so to save you guys from boredom, fast forward like 6 hours later, we hit the bong once more and my friend has a bright idea that we should sneak out to his girlfriends house, i said \"ok but not for long.\"", "he said it won't be, we go, and apparently his girlfriends dad hasn't left to work yet, i automatically was getting the heeby jeebys, i told him we should head home before we get caught, he told me to chill out, (the other kid left home earlier, the dealer was with us) the dealer agreed with me, but my friend insisted we do this since it's his girls last night they get hang out, his dealer, called up a ride and went home, i borrowed his jacket because it was cold as balls outside, so it's just me and my friend, at this park, literally across the street from his girlfriends house, he says we should head down to his house to get something, i really didn't care at that point, i kept on nagging at him to stay at his house, but he insisted on it, so once again, i didn't want to be a pansy, so i went along, we get back at the park, and we are sitting on some swings, his step father call him up, but he declines the call, i ignore it, fast forward an hour, i'm still stoned (i smoked most of what we had), we finally are in his girlfriends house, we are talking, they go in her room i crash on the couch, they later lead me to a bed, i crash again, they wake me up once more to tell me my mom is calling, i automatically wake up, i start freaking out, and answer the call, my mom asks me where me and my friend are at, i of course am still too stoned to think of anything and confess where were at, my dad says to walk a little down the street and he'll come pick us up, we do that, he picks up, he starts yelling at me, i kinda ignore, we get to my house, my mom starts yelling at both of us, his parents pick him up, i go to my room, my mom is still yelling at me, about how i'm grounded for a month (i forgot to mention i'm actually \"the good kid\" in my family, my sister and brother are the bad kids).", "i sit there regretting doing all this shit, my dad finally comes in, he is the most calm at this point, he asks me if we did anything else, i of course am still stoned to a pulp, i confess about us smoking weed, fast forward to tomorrow, after church, they want to tell the girlfriends dad, that we were at his house, (my dad was a specialist at this point, and my friends girlfriends dad was or still is a drill sergeant, he didn't press any charges) after that i was interrogated to tell where the dealer lived, i knew the house and street, i just didn't want to get jumped by him and his buddies, so they ask ny sisters friend who know and hate the dealer, they don't know either, i am a little buzzed by this time, my parents say i'm forbidden to ever talk to those people again, i happily agree, because i know i fucked up big time, i went to school the next day, i tell a couple of friends what happened, they think i'm a badass, (these guys are my true friends, they've had my back for a while, and still do, we were just stupid back then) , well word gets around, and i'm known as the stoner fir doing marijuanas twice, fuck my life right?", "well it gets worst, a month after i'm ungrounded, im hanging out with one of my childhood best friends,  the dealer decides the day to jump me would be that day, they go around the neighborhood i live in, and eventually found me, too bad for them i know where i'm going, i make it to my house, my dad asks why i look so worried (i failed to hide my emotion) i tell him the dealer and his buddies are trying to jump me ( before i forget to mention, my sister and her friends knew that i was going to get jumped, and tried warning me, but i ignored them), my dad tells me to get in the car, i do so, and he gets in, i already see them, and they see me, they dip down a hill, and my dad kinda speeds down the street, but there already gone, a person living in one the houses asks whatsup, my dad explains the problem, the guy offers to help, my dad says no need to, fast forward a couple of hours later, my sister and mom go to hunt this little bitch, they find him, my mom yells at him, she leaves my sister and friends have a staring contest, the dealer makes a move on them, my sisters friend throws a good punch, the dealer starts to cry, they leave, i later that day stayed over at my bestfriends house, being scared shitless thinking i was going to be hunted, never was bothered by that bitch again, i now live in, colorado, and in a way have a love, hate thing for weed ( the love is for helping the people who need it).", "(i was like 13 in my
