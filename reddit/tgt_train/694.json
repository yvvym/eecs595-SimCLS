{"article": ["r/relationships \u2013 i need some advice.", "my girlfriend [24/f] and i [25/m] have been arguing lately over the number of female friends that i have.", "we have been dating for 11 months, and were good friends for about a year before that.", "i have known that she feels uncomfortable with some of my friends, but i never realized on what scale this was bothering her.", "this weekend she was upset because i was excited to see a mutual friend of ours i haven\u2019t seen in a few months \u2013 we were going to take a trip together out of town to celebrate our friend\u2019s birthday.", "i mentioned that i was excited to go, and while i was catching up with this person we started talking about music \u2013 we were in a big group and apparently at one point i said that she \u201cwould be the only one here\u201d who would know of a particular dj.", "she didn\u2019t say anything about this at the time, but yesterday she calls me to apologize for acting strange and getting jealous on another occasion over the weekend, because i started talking to her about how much an environmentalist our friend is, and that she felt that i should be putting her first in my mind.", "this escalated from an apology when i asked her to elaborate, as i care about her and don\u2019t want to make her upset\u2026 she starts giving me examples from months ago \u2013 like when i congratulated another female friend on being able to take a large bong hit \u2013 or when my other female friend of 6 years that i see about once a month likes to give me a hug when she sees me.", "she brought up the fact that an old friend of mine from high school that i haven\u2019t spoken to in years recently wrote on my instagram saying hello \u2013 but she keeps repeating that i speak to her \u2018all the time.\u2019   i would say my distribution of close friends between male and female is about equal \u2013 she has a few close female friends and no male ones.", "her previous boyfriend was a jealous person and forbade her from hanging out with anyone else on her own \u2013 regardless of gender.", "so i understand if it makes her feel weird that i have close friends who happen to be women\u2026 but last night we spoke on the phone for about 7 hours, and she said things like \u201ci\u2019ve never had a male friend that didn't try to fuck me,\u201d and \u201call your girlfriends act like you\u2019re their gay friend.\u201d she finished off the debacle by saying that she talked to a friend of ours who told her that her boyfriend and her don\u2019t talk to people of the opposite gender anymore because they both would become extremely jealous \u2013 and that i shouldn't feel the need to fill my time with other women because i have her.", "i tried to explain that i have been friends with these people long before i met her, and that i am not comfortable with not speaking to them and have always looked down on those who drop their friends while in a relationship.", "she counters saying that she is not asking me to stop talking to anyone, but how would i feel if she started hanging out all the time with another guy?", "i was honest with her and stated that if it was someone new she just met, i would feel strange \u2013 but on the other hand, if he was a good friend of 5 or 6 years, of course i wouldn\u2019t be upset!", "i trust her to not do anything dishonest, and maintaining friendships is important.", "she gets extremely upset and tells me that i have been hanging out with new women from work \u2013 and she mentions that i told her about my employee taking a vacation to india this summer.", "i tell her i only told her about that because it was interesting, and that i haven\u2019t ever crossed a professional boundary with any of my employees.", "she insists that i only go \u201con-and-on\u201d about my female employee and have never spoken of the male ones \u2013 which is seriously un-true, i know that i spoke to her and used their names occasionally.", "i suggested that perhaps she only remembers my interactions with women and doesn\u2019t give a second thought to the men, and now has a slanted view of my interactions with others.", "she tells me that obviously i get along with women better than men, but that she has to watch out because friends are the ones who can become more than friends and ruin existing relationships.", "she tells me that she has always been a jealous person and that she is working on it\u2026 i have always been a friendly person, i don\u2019t feel like i have \u2018a lot\u2019 of friends, but i have met and maintained friendships with both male and female persons for many years \u2013 and those friendships are important to me.", "i tried to explain that our differences are what make us interesting as a couple \u2013 and that we have similarities where it matters most.", "i also stated that if she expects me to accept that she is jealous, that she will need to accept that i have other important people in my life that i am not prepared to abandon or change the dynamic of our friendship dramatically.", "i don\u2019t think about my female friends romantically \u2013 if i did i\u2019m pretty sure that would just be awkward for everybody!", "not to mention that some of the people she is upset about are already involved in their own relationships, homosexual, etc\u2026 i think she has this idea that all men are incapable of having a platonic friendship with someone of the opposite gender, and it hurts that she doesn\u2019t trust me and gets upset when i tell her a friend called me during the day or writes something to me on social media.", "worse still, i make a point to invite her with me when i hang out with these people as much as possible.", "i want her to feel comfortable with my friends \u2013 i want my friends to become our mutual friends.", "i invited her out with me and my close friend of 6 years a few weeks ago \u2013 she told me last night the she was upset that she hugged me, upset that we talk about things occasionally that she wasn\u2019t around for, and just felt like a 3rd wheel.", "i made a lot of effort to make sure she was included, and was not ignoring her or anything of the sort.. i was walking around with my arm around my girlfriend and most of the time the conversation was something we could all participate in.",

since high school (if you can call that serious).", "is it just expected that you gradually stop talking to people of the opposite gender?", "i am trying to be conscious of her feelings, and of course some jealously can be natural, but i also feel like she is dismissing the close friendships i\u2019ve formed and had before she was even in the picture.", "i feel at my wits end with everything \u2013 i try not to link past resolved issues, but last week we had a major fight about how i didn\u2019t make an attempt to be intimate with her while i was sick \u2013 which ended in her storming out of the house at 3am.", "i never wanted to be in a relationship where i argue with someone in the driveway in the middle of the night, or shut myself in my room on the phone from the time i get home from
