at least officially/i know about).", "so here i am thinking, hi nice to meet you i still have a thing for your girlfriend...so of course the next two hours i was at the party i was awkward and

need it.", "so i message h telling her that i'd like to grab lunch with her to actually catch up and not be all awkward like at the party.", "she agrees and we go to lunch and it went well.", "nothing was really said, just basically a couple of friends hanging out.", "a few weeks later i'm at another friends partying and i invite her to come with me.", "she then tells me she is going to a bar with

house.", "when we get there we go inside and up to the roof, she could not find anything to smoke (her whole family smokes but couldn't find any) so we just sat on the roof talking for a bit.", "she

all together because it was both confused, happy and drunk.", "eventually something stupid and funny happened to which we both started laughing and she made a comment about how i was shaking and i think i said \"i told you so\" (i was referring to the fact that right before making out with me she asked how far i had been with a girl, to which i replied honestly with nowhere...yea i know...very little confidence) after which she then just laid in my arms until we fell asleep.", "ok here's the finisher, a few days later i ask if i can meet up with her to talk to her about something, she
