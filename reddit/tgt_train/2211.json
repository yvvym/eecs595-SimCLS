man at a sporting event.", "the event itself was a dud for the home team so we ended up basically talking the entire night, and our conversation went really well - we talked about everything, he was really interested in what i did for work and my hobbies and all that good stuff, and at the end of the night we exchanged numbers.", "now as i was talking to him, i could definitely tell there was an age difference...how much, i'm not sure.", "i'm going to peg him at 35, but i'm not great with ages and he could be younger.", "regardless, he is definitely older than me, and this isn't a situation where he doesn't know how young i am - he asked me where i went to school and i told him i had graduated a year ago, and that i'm 22. of course, there's no real way to ask someone's age unless they freely offer it without being rude, and i don't know his last name so i can't look him up online to see.", "anyway, during this conversation i pretty much made it clear that i don't want a relationship and that my behavior isn't conducive to a healthy one.", "i don't like texting, i don't like to be in constant communication with people, i am definitely not in a place in my life where i want to interact with a romantic partner every single day.", "he told me he understood, but that would change when i met the right person, and that he wasn't put off by it.", "so anyway, we text, and we make plans to go out last sunday for dinner and drinks.", "but leading up to that date, i didn't really text him...again, like i said i wouldn't.", "when we eventually meet up, though, the date was incredible.", "i'm going to run through everything i remember to see if i'm potentially missing some red flags, since i'm not experienced with dating and have only been with two guys.",

am.", "he is wealthy, and he talks about it, but i was raised in an upper middle class family so money isn't exactly something that gets my tongue wagging.", "at the same time, i was definitely /impressed/.", "he drives a bmw, has a black card, took me to a really expensive place for drinks, etc.", "and those things definitely came up in conversation, but again, i'm not sure if that's a red flag.", "so as dinner was ending, i jokingly commented that some of the bbq sauce from his side of the pizza got on the final piece i was eating.", "again, i didn't really care, but when the waitress came over he jokingly made a big deal about it.", "for like a minute he went on about how i was upset, that i was going to eat it, about telling the chef, and he wasn't being mean about it but i could tell the waitress was flustered.", "so i laughed it off and assured her that nothing was wrong, i was good, and we went on our way.", "so as we pulled up to the place to get drinks, there was a valet option, and i was like \"oh, don't you just want to park it?\"", "and he was like \"yeah, i'm not parking my own fucking car.\"", "now i'm not proud of this, but i'm a little turned on by arrogance, so i played into it.", "when we sat down at the bar and the bartender asked what i wanted, i was like \"oh, any vodka besides stoli is fine\" and he cut in and was like, \"she'll have grey goose\".",

both want to go.", "i noted that i'd like to do some solo traveling, and that i wouldn't necessarily enjoy traveling the entire world with just one person.", "the he said something like, \"oh, 'cause you'd be stuck with one stick the entire time?", "so tough.\"", "like implying that i'm going to fuck my way around the world if i'm not traveling with a man i'm in a relationship with?", "but again, i think he was kidding.", "other than those things, we really connected.", "he really reminds me a lot of my dad...i don't know if there's any way that doesn't sound creepy, but personality wise they're just very similar.", "i left the date wanting to see him again, and i told him so when he drove me back.", "i jokingly (but not really, i do actually do this) said that i do public record searches on any guy i potentially date, but that i wouldn't do it to him, then he said that i could.", "and that'd he'd been arrested twice for fighting and spent the night in jail, which i didn't really think was a big deal, because i don't think he'd have a good job if he /actually/ was convicted or did real time so i'm guessing he was just booked on disorderly conduct and let go.", "but he was honest and upfront about it.", "anyway, as i was getting out he said \"the ball's in your court\" now, i.e., i was going to have to be the one to set up the next date.", "which i said was totally fine, and i tried to all this week.", "i texted him on tuesday saying that i'd come over on friday, that he didn't need to take me out anywhere and that we could just hang.", "then he never texted me
