but it's only because it's true.", "it might help with input better.", "he wears completely different clothes, and has a weird haircut now, and also doesn't shave his face ever (which i never had a problem with when we were together, if he didn't shave), but the way it looks now, is a bit ridiculous.", "like he's letting himself go.", "it's almost like he's not trying as hard anymore, even though he has a new girl.", "well, the new girl doesn't try to make herself look good...so maybe that's why he doesn't care.", "hmm.", "even his friends have commented on how he looked better at the beginning of the year, when he was still with me.", "he looked clean, and not so dirty?", "i just feel really bad for him, and how he feels the need to do this, when i haven't been returning the hostility.", "it really does not make him look any better, and yet, still, after all he's put me through, i still love him just as much as day one.", "i just hope to god he realizes he's messing up so bad.", "edit 2: i just don't understand why he's hanging out with the people he hated when we were together, and he said he would never be associated with, and why he's smoking so much weed, when he told me adamantly how much he hated that shit.", "how he's with a new girl, when i was told on multiple occasions without any asking him to do so, how he hated the mere thought of him being with another girl, and it disgusted him to even think of it.", "how i was exactly what he wanted.", "how, we had planned a life together.", "how we both wanted to go into the medical career field, and wanted to go to the same colleges, do the same thing, work and live together, make a family.", "and now he's saying none of that ever happened, and all those views on our life together were never real.", "i don't know why or how he's making such an alternate reality for himself, but surely, he has to realize that everything he is saying that didn't happen, happened.", "how could you really lie
