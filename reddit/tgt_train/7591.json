{"article": ["i'm hoping for advice from people who are monogamous and who's partner is polyamorous.", "i'm [f24] in a relationship of two years with my boyfriend[m21] and we live together, and about a year into our relationship he told me he wanted a polyamorus relationship after he met a woman[f33] through a video game they both played, who herself has a long term boyfriend.", "her boyfriend has recently met a girl as well.", "as it stands, i am the only one involved who is monogamous, and although i understand how someone can be polyamorous and i've accepted that, i just can't understand it in the same way.", "my boyfriend is incredibly supportive, but disconnects do happen for me due to advice and support being from people who are all in poly relationships, so it's starting to feel like this sort of thing only works if everyone is poly and i'm struggling with it.", "some advice from a mono person who is with a poly or would be fine with it would be very helpful.", "a bit of backstory, initially, i didn't deal well with this at all.", "i felt extremely hurt for a long time.", "i got a whole host of insecurities and blamed myself, as well as loosing trust in his feelings for me for the first six months.", "we talked about it, i opened up a lot more so that he knew how i was feeling and could address it, and we have a great relationship now.", "i am happy with him, but i'm still struggling on certain things that make me question whether i'm doing something that is right for me.", "sometimes, like right now, i get overwhelmed that i feel it's all too much to deal with and i feel like i'm going to snap and just give up, which i really don't like.", "at the moment, i keep comparing myself to his other partner and always think i fall short in terms of looks.", "there's still big insecurities there, but i've lost a lot of confidence (due to other non related reasons as well) which is making it difficult to confront this head on, and  still feel secure in the relationship.", "my boyfriend suggested i try talking with her in a non personal, neutral setting to show me that we were both just people, so we played some video games whilst talking on skype which did help take her off the pedestal i was putting her onto.", "my coping strategy previously was to ignore anything to do with their relationship and keep the everything separate, but that wasn't an option because he speaks to her in front of me and it wouldn't be fair on him to restrict that.", "however it's exacerbated by my boyfriend and i living in a one room flat.", "his partner lives abroad so he'll spend a long time talking to her, which i can't get away from even if i wanted to.", "it puts strain on both of us because i don't want to hear it, and he in return has to be careful of what he's saying and keep it very neutral for my sake.", "i do feel bad about that.", "but it still really hurts to hear him talk to her affectionately and that hasn't gotten easier with time which concerns me.", "i also feel like i'm in the way when he brings up what i consider to be more private topics because it seems totally wrong that i should be hearing it.", "that then causes problems with feeling uncomfortable in my own place.", "my boyfriend has suggested that going on a group webcam chat together so we can meet each other in a neutral and non personal way which might help me to make the whole situation more relatable and normal for me.", "i would be willing to do this at a time when i'm comfortable because i think it may help.", "another suggestion he has made is participating and exposing myself to more personal topics which i currently find really difficult to hear.", "i don't mean that he outright says everything bluntly, but i'm having difficulties even with casual mentions to affection, intimacy ect.", "it doesn't happen all the time, but he is limiting how he talks to her because it upsets me to hear it, so the suggestion is that if i expose myself to it and feel like shit afterwards, he will support me through that and eventually it might improve to a point where i am less affected by it.", "i don't know if i am comfortable with that, because it could also cause additional problems if it doesn't help.", "this doesn't mean his relationship is completely off-the-table topic.", "we speak about it, and discuss things through if he needs to talk about something, and i can do that and support him as long as it's not really personal shit.", "listening to him talk to her intimately about personal things, however, is what i'm finding hard to do still, which causes problems.", "he doesn't like hiding things, and he's finding it more difficult to keep a neutral conversation with her for my sake, which i totally understand.", "i want him to be able to talk to her more intimately around me without ending up feeling like shit because it's not good for their relationship, but at the same time it hurt's like hell hearing it because i'm not comfortable getting that involved with their relationship.", "i don't know if i could go that far, or if i ever will be able to.", "i'm also concerned that if it doesn't help then nothing has changed for me, although it would help him.", "sometimes i feel like i'm making more and more compromises and when i have a bad day with it, i can't help but wonder if this is something i'm ever going to be able to work on to the level that seemingly needs to happen to make a poly relationship work.", "another issue is progression in the relationship.", "he would like to see both partners equally, whereas at the moment he sees me on average 3 weeks out of a month, and his other partner only a weekend every month.", "i totally get how awful that must be, and how it's not sustainable.", "his ideal plan would be some way to see us both equally, and eventually have a proper house to ourselves and splitting his time equally between us.", "so at some point, i will go from seeing him often, as i like in a relationship, to only ever seeing him a two weeks out of a month, for the rest of the relationship.", "i don't yet know if that is something i can accept, or whether i will find later, when it happens, that it's not sustainable for me or the future i want.", "putting it bluntly, being alone half the time to continue to be with someone who will always have one partner there with them is a difficult thing to accept.", "i have no idea if i'll be able to do that, or whether i'm going to make a right choice where i'll be happy.", "i really want to be with him, and at the same time i'm
