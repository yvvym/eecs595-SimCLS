wack, i might want to get a house soon.", "he basically says he might have to get a second job and \"work himself into the grave\" because i'm so selfish and won't help my family.", "i explain that i've been trying to pay my loans down and improve my credit score and start my life.", "when he was my age he had a house, a new car, he was married, and i was already born.", "i am 26, i want to start my life.", "he doesn't seem to get it.", "he says maybe his wife's disability will help when it kicks in.", "if you're keeping score, i've already added $18,000 of debt to my name, all in the interest of helping out my family.", "i haven't told you about his wife at all.", "ugh.", "his third wife, who he married when i was out of the state, secretly, and i only found out about when i got back.", "his wife who was a nurse, and so made such good money that she would help him pay his credit card debt down (never happened) and they would be able to buy me a car.", "(of course that never happened, i never expected it to, and when i said so, they got mad that i wasn't grateful for this hypothetical car) like two years ago, she claims she has some mitochondrial disease (the doctors can't identify it) and claims she's so sick she can't work anymore.", "quits her job, does nothing but laze around the house and spend my dad's money.", "also she has 3 kids, that my dad now fully supports.", "i'm really bitter about this because she has ruined his finances so much worse than i have, and he married her in secret even though i made it clear i did not like her, fully expected her to stop working once they got married, and asked him to please just wait a year before he married her to just get to know her.", "anyway, this is week 3, my stress levels have been through the roof trying to keep everyone happy.", "this is hell.", "i've been trying to find somewhere on the cheap side for him to move to close to campus to save on miles on that truck and try to keep it from breaking down.", "i found a place that looked pretty good for $550 today and texted my dad about it.", "this is the actual exchange:   me [link to apartment] 11:11am me i contacted them 12:18pm   father and me dunno yet.", "seems like it would be close to $550 but its a good area   father ?", "me what?", "father what do you mean close to 550 me $400 rent + $150 utilities...   father that will  be all of his money in just rent not fixing the truck or anything me well, have you just given up on finding him somewhere else to stay and decided that he is going to stay with me  or what?", "father no i'm trying to find a way to keep him in school to get his degree.", "is it you or [girlfriend] or both that wants him gone?", "me it's not an ideal situation for anyone, and you aren't even looking anymore.", "it went from \u201cit will just be 2 weeks\" to \u201cit will just be a month\" to \u201cim not looking anymore and he is going to live with you.\"", "father i am still looking because i feel he isn't welcome at your place, i just want to know if it is you or [girlfriend] or both that don't want him there me i'm not even going to answer the question because of the way you are phrasing it.", "you're trying to guilt trip me and i'm sick of it.", "father i never thought that if you had the means to help your brother that you would act like you are acting 12:44pm you could look at it like i'm paying 450 a month for his rent (referring to what he is paying on the parent plus loan)   all this while i'm at work.", "i can't concentrate anymore, so i leave and call him.", "we end up in a huge fight, where he blames me for ruining his finances by taking too long to get through school, says i'm a horrible brother because i don't want my brother living here permanently, says i have too much of my mother in me to care about my family.", "gets all pathetic and says he guesses he was just a piece of shit father who can't pay for my brother's college.", "lots of self pity and attempted emotional manipulation.", "keeps saying if my girlfriend will move out just because my brother moved in then she obviously isn't the one for me anyway.", "doesn't care that he's asking me to throw away a 2 year relationship that was going well (best relationship i've been in, and we were actually discussing engagement and stuff) keeps trying to act like he has sacrificed so much for me, but in all honesty, he gets whatever he wants.", "he's had 2 houses, 3 cars, 3 wives, and 2 kids.", "i have had none of this, and the way things are looking, might never have any of it, and he's actually making my situation worse.", "i tell him after the divorce, i'm not susceptible to emotional manipulation, and ask if he wants to have a rational adult discussion with me.", "he hangs up, and i get this after:   i don't care who are you are not talking to your father like you just did, calm down and we can talk me quit trying to use emotional and psychological distractions and logically discuss the situation with me like an adult and we can talk.", "if we have no funds, then he can stay with me rent free, but whatever money is left over after his tuition is paid needs to be returned to the loan agency i'm not putting myself in debt to fix an 18 year old truck that i don't own   father you will never talk to me like that again, i hope you understand that!", "i am your father and i have done a lot for you.", "i will not be treated like that by anyone any more me you treat me with disrespect, and on that phone call, enough disrespect that i'd have grounds to stop talking to you, except that would mean hurting [my brother].", "and you have no grounds to tell me who i can talk to who how, since apparently [my brother] can't go to college without my help.", "so cool your macho power trip and treat me with the respect i deserve as an adult, not your kid that you can push around and guilt trip.", "it was entirely uncalled for to say \"you've got too much of your mom's family\" but sure, i'll let him stay, and i'll sacrifice my own relationships for him but i'm not letting that loan money go toward that truck.", "you said you'd pay to fix it up if i got a new car   father if you want to stop talking to me that is your choice if this separates us it would have happened at some point.", "ask yourself when i have ever put myself before you or [my brother] me when you married ay knowing we didn't like her didn't consider your finances or your real family, and married her right away and lied to us about it, did it when i was out of state now name a time where i put myself before you or [my brother].", "was it when i was going to the school that you wanted me to go to using loans that you said \"don't worry about them, you can pay them back when you graduate, and i'll help however i can?\"", "was it when i bought a new car and cosigned on a loan so that he would supposedly have enough money and a vehicle so that he could move out?", "how much debt do i have to take on before i'm not a selfish asshole anymore?", "father i will try to get him out of your way as soon as i can me i said, it's fine, he can stay rent free.", "but i want any excess loan money returned.", "i'm not taking money out of the loan to pay myself rent that will damage my debt to income ratio that doesn't make any sense   father i'm driving me when do you get the rest of that loan money back?", "whatever didn't go to tuition?", "you realize if i were to keep part of that loan money as rent, it's basically like taking money out of one pocket, throwing part of it away, and putting it in my other pocket.", "it doesn't make any sense.", "and using college loans to fix up a truck is a horrible financial decision.", "either you have money to fix the truck up, or you don't, and if you don't, and it breaks, then he can take the bus to school.", "his classes start late enough that it wouldn't be a huge burden.", "i mean it makes no sense at all to take out a $6,000 loan if that's not for rent.", "and i haven't heard from him since.", "so there you have it.", "after giving up my vehicle and getting an auto loan and higher insurance, and co-signing a student loan for him,
