i wanted to see if he was actually interested in me or whether he was just putting up with me for that day to be kind.", "my messages after meeting him were like this: me: i just wanted to say sorry for leaving so abruptly i was just worried i wasn't going to make it on time me: i got really lost on the way back again me: also, i really enjoyed being with you  [i was worried i had upset him by just leaving after he offered for me to stay and chill] two minutes later the guy replies: oh that's alright, no worries.", "haha cutie guy: thanks.", "i enjoyed being with u as well me: i can still taste you haha guy: hahaha me: do you have fb?", "guy: yes.", "i do not live under a rock me: should i add you?", "me: its fine if you dont want to guy: add me :)   then the next day i sent him this message: are you interested in meeting again?", "i kind of felt like perhaps you weren't enjoying it so much because i was doing stuff wrong and because i was awkward haha.", "but if you did like it i'm definitely up for doing something again guy: i am up for meeting again.", "you were sweet and cute me: yay :) when would be good for you?", "guy: i don't know  [this guy is really indecisive with what times would be good to meet up, to the point that it got really irritating]   i thought that was a fairly good outcome.", "that he was calling me cute and he wanted to meet again suggested to me that there was some kind of connection.", "i felt dizzy with excitement again.", "so, while i was waiting for him to come up with a more decisive time to meet, i started chatting to another guy on grindr because i wanted to tell someone about my experience.", "mainly, i wanted to know if it was unusual to have a crush on someone after meeting them only once.", "so i started telling this nice random grindr guy all about the guy i met, telling him what we did and that i can't stop thinking about him and that i love the way he smells etc.", "in the end, this random guy wanted to know what he looked like so i sent him a screenshot of his profile.", "by some weird coincidence it turned out that this guy knew my crush and that he was his first guy as well.", "he found it hilarious.", "he said that they used to be in a relationship but they were just friends now.", "it also transpired that this grindr guy was the person that my crush was going to see after meeting me (i have no idea what they did though).", "as a result, this grindr guy started chatting with the guy i met (let's call my crush david) and told david that i had a crush on him, which was quite embarrassing.", "i tried to make the most of the situation though by trying to find out about david, to see if he was anybody even worth having a crush on.", "i asked grindr guy if he agreed that david was lovely and he said: yes, he's the best, so kind.", "david just seemed to be getting better in my eyes.", "i asked if david if he was freaked out by the fact that i had a crush on him already and he said it was fine but that i shouldn't let him take over my mind.", "i asked if he still wanted to meet up (still no time had been decided) and he said he wasn't sure -

dancing was apparently a good way to strengthen his body.", "i thought it was so sweet how he was opening up to me.", "i started drawing parallels between us as well: we both had international childhoods (david was a cuban living in sweden, i'm a mixture of sweden, england and germany); we both had sob stories from our childhood (although i never told him mine, i didn't want things to get depressing); we were both lefties; and (the most ridiculous of them all) when we were born we were both unusually large babies.", "then we went back to my place and had sex.", "i was dying to touch him, i wanted him so badly.", "this time it was even better, it was so hot (although he still never made me cum).", "but while we were doing it, my grandma came home and very nearly walked in on us.", "i asked if he regretted coming to my house and he said 'a bit', which was rather heartbreaking.", "after he came (as in ejaculated), he left soon after because the mood was ruined by the fact that my grandma had come home.", "at this point, i still never thought that there would be any chance of us being in a relationship, i just wanted to make the most of him during the few days that i had left in sweden before i had to go to germany.", "he was still being really sweet to me though.", "after i left, i sent him a message saying: hope you're ok - sorry about the awkward situation [my grandma] me: i'm really happy i met you today though :) [half an hour later] me: please say it was at least a little bit fun... i feel bad for putting you into an uncomfortable situation david: i am ok. its alright [a smiley blowing a kiss].", "i am happy too.", "you are so sweet.", "i didn't really know what to make of this.", "he was being so lovely but he didn't want me to get attached either.", "i didn't message him any more after that.", "however, later that evening he sent me a message asking me how i was.", "me: i'm not sure - it feels so strange and new to me me: how are you?", "me: what are you up to?", "me: i'm pleased i was with you, i don't think i could have found a better person to have my first time with me: but i hate it when you take ages to reply david: sorry.", "text me on fb david: i am good.", "just chilling david: awwww thank u   then he didn't write anything else so i asked him if he wanted to come round to watch a movie or something because i had a free place.", "david replies: i'll think about it [winking smiley]   by this point i was getting extremely frustrated and confused.", "why would he ask me how i was if i wasn't going to say anything else?", "why would he 'think about it' -

holding me close to him while he slept.", "it was the same when we woke up: he was sort of dozing but he was still caressing me.", "it felt like i wanted to lie in bed like this with him forever.", "i had never experienced something so wonderful before.", "then my grandma rang and said she would be coming back in a few hours (unfortunately).", "so despite the fact that we had a time limit, we still had sex again.", "again, it was amazing (but that time only he jizzed again).", "as he was leaving i asked if he wanted to see me again and he said he didn't think about things as much as i did -

if he had just said no then i could forget about him.", "i said this to him as well and asked if it's best if i just forget about him and he said it's up to me (which is another really frustrating response).", "it's horrible because the fact that he wanted to remain friends mean we are still in contact but with me constantly hoping that one day he would be my boyfriend.", "it sounds like a terrible, painful friendship.", "but i would also be willing to do that if it meant that one day i could be his boyfriend.", "it feels like if the possibility exists for me to spend time with him then i would always take it, even if it meant i got hurt afterwards because i love him so much.", "i wonder if i feel so attached to him because he was simply my first guy but then i realise that this isn't the case -
