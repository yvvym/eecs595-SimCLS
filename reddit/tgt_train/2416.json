also has a girlfriend)   gf: dw we'll get you someone ;) guy: she's gotta be hot though gf: thought anyone was good enough for you guy: hey, you need somebody too gf: you gotta find me a hot guy with a sexy body lol guy: we'll go looking for some     (this is apparently in joking context but still) guy: i'm surprised you haven't fucked the guy gf: what're you calling me a hoe?", "guy: ain't no

hot!!", "(separate day) gf: she gives you food and i give you massages guy: i like when you massage me :( gf: like you've had any other massages guy: i want you though man you always bring me food and massage me lol     (separate day) gf: i felt bad so i chilled with the dude guy: at his place?", "gf: yeah lol guy: dw i won't tell your boyfriend gf: nothing happened though we just played games guy: it starts with that though ;) gf: ahaha he's so thirsty though     (separate day) gf: i can't do anything with him until he's better (me) guy: ahaha you're just a tease gf: don't remind me guy: guess your thirsty gf: find me someone hot!!!", "guy: you got a nice ass you don't need me gf: nooo i do need you guy: dw i'll give you all the help you need gf: find me some hot ass guys until my boyfriend

you bang that guy\" \"yeah he's hot\" because sometimes we do in fact do stuff like that, because i feel like that's alright to an extent, but she doesn't know that i know any of this and she always
