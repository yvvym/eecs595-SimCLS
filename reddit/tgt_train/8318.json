woman in her 30s a regular who usually gets way too drunk pushes a guy a little too hard down the covered in alcohol steps towards the bar the guy smashes his head off the corner of the bar and is knocked out so i ring an ambulance and it comes pretty quick because the guy still isn't awake and at this point the bouncers have moved everyone out onto the street the ambulance has to park around the corner because of the amount of people and have to carry him around and get him into the ambulance through about 200 people dunno what happened to the dude but we had to close at 11 when we usually closed at 5am so i know this sounds bad but thank you random dude you saved me 6 hours of looking after wrecked middle aged people i hope your okay"], "abstract": ["woman smashed guys head off
