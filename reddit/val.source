I'm getting into dfs more seriously and am wondering what the consensus is on investing in daily "cheat sheets" or other lineup optimizers?  I have created my own excel to track my winning/losings but I haven't created (don't know how) to create a daily lineup.  I do take advantage of the free options out there that make suggestions on dfs picks but wondered if it is worth it to invest in a paid service for dfs and if so which would you recommend (rotowire, etc.)?  Thanks for any advice.
I'll focus on the cold for you. If you're seriously thinking of not interviewing at a medical school that you could turn you into a real life doctor because it's cold, get a sweater and go to the interview. Done. Vermont is awesome.   Also, what happens when you have to do this all over again for residency interviews? Fellowship? Staff jobs? There's a lot yet to come. If you're wavering already...how sure are you that you really want to do this?   The only reason I would say don't go is if you are absolutely 100% sure that you wouldn't attend the school if it was your only offer, because I've heard declining an acceptance would make it virtually impossible to get in again elsewhere.
Really hard to tell if you're being sarcastic.... b/c that's exactly what "rolling over" debt is. US Treasury bonds (and nearly all gov't debt) are paid at maturity with new issues. So it's actually "we sell more bonds, while paying them off". Hence why we continuously run a deficit.   Also, it's definitely not  unreasonable  to say it sounds like a Ponzi scheme. The biggest difference is that our central bank is the largest buyer of Treasuries, so in effect our gov't is printing money to pay off maturing debt (and fund fiscal deficits). That's not conspiracy theory or anything, it's literally what's happening. It's nice when you can be your own lender of last resort.   /u/Mason11987 this isn't directed entirely at you (judging by your comment history, I'm sure you're a pretty bright person), but it's just an opinion I feel the need to get out there after reading this thread and many other related topics lately..... Economics is not a science. And it's a shame that many (read: everyone) are led to believe that what they learned in their college Econ classes is directly applicable to, and even supported by, what actually happens in the economy. For instance, Ben Bernanke, the current Fed Chairman, has spent pretty much his entire adult life studying the Great Depression. He and his colleagues have come to the conclusion that much of the pain could've been reduced if central banks had been more accommodative (i.e., sustained low interest rates and liquidity injections). Now that's entirely based upon theory, and models to fit that theory. There is no way to know if it would've made things much better. Until now, when those theories can be put to the test. It's an academic's wet dream. Especially when after every sign that things aren't improving much, the only necessary answer is "not enough is being done". And when interest rates (which affect  everyone ) are being controlled by academics looking to prove a theory.... well, you get the idea.   I think it's absurd that anyone who disagrees with how the Fed operates must know nothing about Economics. If anything, it should be the opposite. If you understand how the economy works, and understand that it is  far  too complex for any theory or model to make exact estimations about where it is headed, then you should be able to take one look at the Fed and its academic nature, and realize how insane it is. I'm not saying it should be eliminated. Central banks are absolutely necessary. But if you think it's logical for unelected officials to have this much power, all career academics with  extreme  bias.... well, then you're also most likely one of those people getting "annoyed" on a daily basis by people who had no interest in taking Econ 101.
I'm currently working on a documentary as part of my senior thesis for college.  A small group of students, professionals and myself traveled to Alaska over the summer to shoot an adventure race spanning 400+ miles through the Kenai peninsula. Now, we're back in Ohio and have started logging, transcribing, etc...   The post process has been a bit hectic.  We don't have a server to work off of.  We have 5 computers all set up to mirror each other (exact same file structure).   We have done all of our logging in prelude, but now we need to transfer the metadata between computers.  All of the metadata was written directly to each clip (so metadata will only appear for a lip on one computer).  Is there an easy way to do this with prelude?  Is it possible to export all of the metadata created within a project?
I'm curious if  /r/games  can help provide me with a good idea of Sony's game plan for the next gen. because I think with this last generation Sony flopped pretty hard. That's not to say Playstation 3 isn't the best console- at least hardware wise- or that it doesn't have good games, but really the company lost tons of ground to Xbox 360 and Microsoft mostly I think due to pricing at release. So how does Sony recoup and recover its market share and revamp excitement about its playstation products and the long gaming history the hold a large part of?   I just want it to be known as well that: 1) I don't game nearly as much as I used to, so I'm probably not really 'right' about lots of things I said, and 2) I don't own or play console games anymore- just do PC- and so I'm not aware of all the little pros and cons that come with specific consoles in this generation. It just seems that if people have a console, more likely than not it is an Xbox 360. If my question is unclear I can try to clean it up for!
I have no idea where to go to find family history, but here I go.   I come from a tall family. Almost every one on my moms side has been over 6ft tall. A reoccurring trait with my moms side of the family gives me something to look forward to when I reach old age: The eldest male is consistently the tallest. The joke is that in addition to not shrinking like proper old people should, we GROW a few inches. (Which is of course, a joke) For example, my grandpa is the current "head" of the family. I am 6ft 4 inches tall and growing. I have to TIPTOE to hug him. He is 78 years old and able to beat most of us in arm wrestling. The man's a legend. His motto is "If someone ever asks you "hows the weather up there?", spit on them and say "Its raining"." But back to the original question, I think the most noteworthy thing my ancestors have done is been denied from joining the us military for 3+ generations for the same reason: Flat feet(Easily tired and difficult to move large distances without moderate pain.) It happened to my great great grandpa, my great grandpa, and my current grandpa.
Sir,  my rock was glorious.   Twas a brisk autumn afternoon,  the day I found my anvilstone. Trekking through the woods,  I came upon a sunbathéd glade,  Apollo's gilded shafts raining down upon the dew-covered grass, the sweet scent of petrichor dancing upon my nose.   There,  in the centre of the glade,  lay a magnificent stone, it's ancient face worn smooth by generations of weary wayfarers' stopping to rest their weary limbs. Underneath the thick blanket of moss and lichen which obscured it,  the telltale grain of schist smiled at the world.   I then used the rock to make some nails on.
Hello fellow non-fappers. I've  both enjoyed and been motivated by others' progress reports, so I figured I'd type out my own.  To give a little background: I'm 23, and I have had problems with ed since I can remember (with women).  I've dated  and been able to overcome it, but I am still leery and avoidant of casual sex. Dating is also more nerve-racking than it ever should be.  I never quite understood why I had this issue though, as I was able to masturbate just fine; enter /nofap and yourbrainonporn, and the light clicks. Its been two weeks, and it has been interesting.  First off, I am now exceptionally horny-I haven't gotten full-on erections while simply talking to women, but the boys have definitely been stirring much more than usual in non-sexual situations. This is good :) No wet dreams; morning/night wood seem to be functioning normally. On the 4-5th days I found myself having pretty radical mood swings, but then those subsided. The past two nights (12/13), I've had terrible insomnia- during which I found my mind wandering to sexual thoughts which were difficult to displace.  As you might imagine, my mood today is pretty shitty. Overall, though, I am extremely optimistic: I began the challenge extremely skeptical and still have experienced a variety of both pleasurable and painful phenomena that I didn't think was possible in such a short time.
I always disliked how he would get mad over every.single.thing. Whenever he got mad, he would just shut me out and stop talking to me. We would go on dates and he would just go off to a different corner of the room if I said or did anything that even slightly offended him. The last straw was when I asked him to go to a party with me and he showed up in one of those "bro" tanks. I asked him why he was wearing it, since I never saw him wear anything like that before and wasn't even aware he had one. He got mad at me for asking that instead of complimenting me like his friends did. He said very little the rest of the night and in the middle of dancing together he just left me on the dance floor by myself and went home. He didn't even bother to help me find my friends while I was drunk in the middle of a giant crowd.
You'll spend a lot of money, and learn little of practical value in a 2 year school.  4 year, doubly so.     You obviously have a genuine interest in computers, which is more than 80% of the people in the field have.  80% of the people in our field are also nearly worthless, how those two correlate will be left as an exercise for the reader.   My honest opinion given what you've told us...  Learn everything you can on your own, in every waking moment.  Fight for a job immediately, like start looking tonight (after you finish your homework), even if it's a non-paid admin job at a local non-profit.  Keep learning.  By the time you graduate you'll already have a year of experience.  Keep learning.  Fight for a paid job, don't accept helpdesk if you can help it, it will suck the life out of you.  Work your ass off.  Keep learning.   By the time your peer graduates from their two year, you'll already have three years of experience.  And more practical knowledge than them by a long shot.  Keep learning.  Now it's time to think about your real career path.  Are you where you want to be?  What do you want your future path to look like?  Now make it happen.  Look for a place that provides tuition assistance.  Keep learning.   Your four year peer is probably graduating about now.  Lucky for you you're 5 years ahead of him.  But your lead over the two year guy is dwindling, if he's any good your lead is almost spent.  Keep learning.  Now it's time to enroll in school, IF it's something you know will benefit you.  By now you'll know exactly what you'd want/need out of a formal education.  Keep learning.  BTW, that four year guy is working a hell desk job right now, and cursing the 50-100k in debt he has.   You're probably not quite ready to take a management route, but you probably know by now if it's right for you.  THAT is where a 4 year degree will benefit you, so do it.  Otherwise you should be looking at a two year degree to shore up the stack of certs you should have by now.  This may not even be what people would consider a CS degree.  If you have a particular industry or sector you REALLY like working in, a degree relevant to that can do amazing things for your career.  Sr. IT staff (managers/directors) that truly understand the business as a whole, are like gold.   If you've gotten to this point, you already know what to do next, and you don't need my advice.  But my humble request, no matter what your path, is never forget what you look like right now.  Look for those young people throughout your career.  Be they interns, friends kids, or the kid working at the gas station.  Guide those people, they are the future of IT.  They are the ones that innovate and get shit done.  Not the guys that have never touched a computer besides facebook, and want a CS degree because their guidance counselor, or a radio commercial told them that's where the money is.  Those people are shit at their jobs, and you will be cleaning up after them for your entire career.   Good luck
When I was a teen age boy  A Bridge To Far  To be fair it had lots of the best 'splosions I had ever seen, but the stuff going on in between was  even more awesome.   Teen age me understands that many of you, and Michael Bay, think he is not capable of being moved by mighty historical events or deep and thoughtful performances, and wants me to tell you, and him, to *[go fuck yourselves]( with all your crappy little hearts.
O shit i have a good one for once... and only 3 hours in.   Anyways.. in high school.. in a relationship with a girl whose family is SUPER religious... like beyond religious.. like "our daughter isnt allowed to date while she is in high school" religious. (ya i got yelled at...by my girlfriends mom, in front of half the school..good times)... anyways  fast forward 6 months. (ya i know.. i kept dating girl with a crazy family..wtf was i thinking!)   Anyways, were both in her bed.. neither of us have clothes on, family is gone on family vacation... we hear the front door open. Her house is decent size (like 4 bedroom)..but the front door is literally down a hallway from her bedroom door. We both jump up..she grabs a robe and runs into the bathroom and turns on the shower. Im hiding under the bed, with nothing but my underwear on like "FUCK!" (her dad had already threatened me with a baseball bat previously...i was stupid and horny).   3 of her cousins and her aunt (a religious nutjob who wrote me a 2 page letter on how I should not be dating her niece) walk in in the house, turn on the tv, the aunt is in the kitchen, "we need X, we came to borrow it"   (i dont remember what they needed... my inner monologue of "O FUCK O FUCK O FUCK O FUCK" drowned it out).   Her cousin knocks on the bathroom door, she walks out with a pair of workout shorts, and a tshirt on (the tshirt was inside out AND backwards).  "Why are u dressed like that?"  'O i was about to get a shower'.  (she found these clothes in the dirty hamper in the bathroom..apparently they were her little sisters clothes lmao)   This conversation happens about 10 feet from the naked boyfriend hiding under the goddamn bed (me). Her cousin shrugs and walks back to the kitchen.  Im getting dressed, hurredly putting clothes on.  I look at her, and we both connect eyes like "holy shit!"   I tell her to open the door to the garage... she does, i dive from her bedroom into the garage..jump the fence and drive home.   A couple months later... happens again, only this time its her dad..and im driving down her street as i see his car pass -  he drove home from work..an hour away to bring her lunch..what an asshole ><- (luckily he had no idea what car i drove   good times. =D   And this children... is why u always park down the street when on a secret sexy time date with your high school girlfriend.  Thank god I learned that lesson from my older brother...it completely 100% saved my ass that day.
Just for you:
Hey everyone, I made a post  but on the main /r/globaloffensive  subreddit but didn't get much of a response so I am posting here because I think many people will benefit from this. My friend started a league for low ranked players who want to play competitively but didn't have the skill to compete in higher lever tournaments or seasons. It is called CSML (Counter-Strike Mini League) and is for SEM to MG2. CSML consists of a round robin season then all teams are seeded into a single elimination bracket with the highest seed vs the lowest seed and so on with a BO3 final. There is a $10 entry fee, and this all goes to the prize pool.   How the prize pool works:   1st- 70%   2nd- 30%   3rd- Skins from our sponsors   We understand that there will be smurfs who try to participate but we will try to watch every game and do rank checks as much as we can to prevent this. Every match will be live streamed or recorded if we don't have and spectated. If a team is found to have a smurf or cheating, they will be disqualified with no chance of refund.   The main goal of this league is to provide a competitive experience for low ranked teams, and have a prize pool to raise the stakes.   If you would like to participate please contact me on steam:  or twitter:   Thanks for reading, and if you do decide to play I hope you have a great experience   steveNNN Manager, CSML
I apologize in advance if this post is not appropriate for this sub and completely understand if this is not the place for it.   I could probably write an entire novel of details but I'll try to keep this short. My girlfriend started stripping a few months ago as a way to get herself in a financially stable place. I support her decision to provide for herself entirely but it's been a very confusing and taxing time for me. I know its all fantasy there and she has expressed that it is simply a job and that she "shuts off" while there in order to do what she has to do, but wow sometimes the mental movies I create while thinking of her there are so painful at times. That's all on me, not her.   It's only been a few months though and I'm truly making progress on how I feel about the situation. I believe in her and am so proud that she would have the guts to make a choice that she knows would be viewed as taboo by most, including her family and friends. She kicks ass.   The question here though is, do you think some of the people she meets there could make good friends for her even if the friendship was sparked through a sex-industry job such as stripping? She has expressed to me that sometimes she meets some cool people there and that she could see herself having a strictly platonic relationship with them. I have been apprehensive of this idea because I feel that the sexual nature of a place like a strip club would cast an inherently sexual nature over the friendship right from the start. It's not her I'm worried about, I trust her completely. It's the intentions of the people she is meeting there that I don't trust. She has explained that she simply feels lonely after deciding her previous group of friends were not good for her, that she wants more friends in her life and that she doesn't have enough time or energy outside of her two jobs to make that happen.   She says she understands that the idea probably makes me uncomfortable and that she won't make any decisions without us coming to an agreement, but I can tell she resents me for it a bit since it has come up in some recent disagreements. I don't at all get to decide who she begins a friendship with, I'm just feeling conflicted.   So yeah, that's where I'm at.  Any  advice or opinions would be amazing. I'm not posting this to "hear what I want to hear". Input from people within the industry would be really valuable to me right now.
Working in the gaming section at Microcenter. A little boy comes in and starts playing the demo Xbox. A few minutes into the game he proceeds to shit himself, pull his pants down, and yell "I POOPED!" He then runs around the department yelling for his mother for a minute or so, until he calms down, pulls his pants back up, and continues to game. There was a trail of shit ALL over the department, all over the kid, and all over the xbox controller. I asked him his name and paged his mother to the department. Queue look of disappointment and scolding from the mother. We had the close the department for the rest of the day.
Google:   Decades of acquisitions result in Google owning a large portion of the Internet's tubes, over which 90% of the world's command and control traffic is routed.   A Google Lab working on increasing monkey intelligence accidentally creates a virus that creates zombie-like symptoms in carrier pigeons, but because the virus is contained, no one knows this.   A coder working on the latest refresh of the Google mobile site inadvertently includes a string that, when parsed by a Google Car browser, would cause the car to crash, but because Google Car browsers are served a different version of the page, no one notices.   A transformer repairman working on the roof of Google's primary switch building in Mountain View shorts the building's power when his carefully-blown gum bubble pops, causing the facility to shunt its load over to the secondary while it runs diagnostics.   A bum living in a cardboard box in New York sneezes. The force of his sneeze rocks him backwards into a pile of trashcans, which collapses into the street into the path of a schoolbus. The bus rolls, but thanks to reinforced ceiling supports, the children are not crushed, However, the rolled bus stops traffic during rush hour, and a deliveryman bored by the traffic calls up his ex in 'Frisco, on the off chance that she might still love him. She doesn't, and punches the ignore button on her dash the moment she sees the caller id. Her day had been a mass of meetings, and her lewd, leering boss had teased her about her most recent sexual harassment complain after the fourth meeting. It's been on her mind all day, so she decides to use her car's browser to search for spas within walking distance of any BART stop within three stops of her house. She deserves a break after today, she thinks. Her current beau is a bit of a tinkerer, so when she calls up Google Search on her Google Car browser, her browser uses the Android useragent string, and she is consequently sent the bugged version of the Google Search page. The Google Car software crashes. Hurtling down the Bayshore Freeway, her car crashes into the jersey wall and flips over the edge of an overpass, landing on a stack of transformers below. The power cuts out for all of Sunnyvale, Mountain View, and Santa Clara. She dies.   At a now-uncontrolled traffic light on Joaquin Road, a tanker of avgas headed for Moffett Field crashes into a medical resupply truck carrying several thousand liters of compressed oxygen. The resulting explosion levels the primary and secondary switch facilities, shunting all of Google's bay-area traffic onto the tertiary switch, which is located next to the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Station in San Luis Obispo.   Two ways pass. The fires have completely incapacitated the primary and secondary switches, but the tertiary is running well. No schoolchildren were suffered anything more than contusions when the bus rolled. The ex was ticketed for talking while driving. And at 8:06 PM on the third day, a magnitude 9 quake is let loose by the Hosgri Fault, resulting in a tidal wave that swamps the Diablo Canyon plant, which goes into a cold shutdown. No damage is reported at the plant, but the earthquake destroyed several of the Google tertiary switch's backup power sources, and, after seventy-two hours of no external power, the facility shuts down.   The brunt of the West Coast's DNS traffic is shifted to a datacenter in Dallas, Texas, where a disgruntled employee disables the disk room. Massive DNS outages result in large swathes of the West Coast of the U.S, and all of Mexico being unable to resolve DNS queries. Panicked, the rest of the world starts backing up all their data. Inefficiencies result in ionization in the atmosphere, and the difference in population densities between the Southern and Northern hemispheres, combined with the Northern hemispheres's preference for the more electromagnetically-active hard disks, results in the Northern ionosphere becoming more heavily charged.   At this time, an abnormally large sunspot which astronomers had been monitoring for several weeks collapses. The resulting coronal mass ejection collides with earth, and differential forces caused by the differently-charged hemispheres increase Earth's axial tilt by fifteen degrees. Massive climate change is followed by mudslides and forest fires, which effectively remove San Francisco from the map. Electromagnetic interference form the coronal mass ejection's collision with the ionosphere results in sustained electromagnetic interference, effectively returning Earth to the dark ages. With the Internet gone, Google collapses. Nobody notices.
Hello guys,   I recently made an appointment with a chip tuner in Belgium for a stage 1 for my golf diesel. The car has a dpf (roetfilter) installed and needs to pass the euro 5 norm. As I went for the tuning the chipper said that my dpf was full of roet and that he was unable to do a remap, even with a (nood regeneratie).  Then he suggested for a stage 2 which involves removing the dpf. My concern now is, if they remove the dpf will my car still pas the yearly car inspection? The chipper said that it would be no problem, but I am a little sceptical. I have also searched Google and autofrum but I haven't found a good clear answer. Do any of you guys have some experience with this?
I have had my Rift since May 5th.  Love every second with it.  Racing is my go to experience but I've also been playing through Amigdala which is really creeping me out.  Luckily I don't suffer from VR sickness in first person games so I can even stand when playing that one.   But in all my time with the Rift I cant say if I've actually felt presence.  I can really get into the game but I'm always conscious that I have a screen on my face.  I don't think I've ever been like, "woah I just forgot I wasn't actually there".   I can really get into the racing games because i have a wheel but something is always still just a bit off so I never lose myself in it.   My wife freaks out every time I have her do dreamdeck. She refuses to do the dino one anymore because she's convinced it spit on her the first time, and loses her mind when on the skyscraper.  I just dont have that feeling.  It looks great and I can see that it looks like I'm really high up, but my brain wont let me just think I'm really there.    The closest think is when playing Amigdala, I get really sweaty and am afraid to move forward sometimes, but I feel that is more due to the sounds. I can't handle scary games on a monitor either.
Well that's sort of true, and it depends on which era of Godzilla your talking about. Most recent era (excluding the to be released movie) he was just a simple godzillasaur but was later mutated. He wasn't created by the radiation but it gave him a significant boost. You see this happen in the most recent Godzilla vs king ghidorah, when they travel back in time to kill Godzilla on whatever island he's chilling on during WWII before he can be mutated.  the future future humans leave three dorahads that fuse (because of radiation) into king ghidorah and replace Godzilla. So it's pretty clear the nuclear tests had a great deal to do with his creation.
u/dtox12 is the creator of Sidehugs and I guess the rest of the Hugs-imperium as well (?). At some point he deleted his account because of stuff happening in his personal life that required all of his attention. Then he came back as /u/CarRadio, then later the same thing happened again a couple of months ago, and we haven't seen him on reddit since. That's the
This happens quite a lot with most common instances being     People asking for validation rather then advice     People asking to be motivated     People asking for advice on how to do something unhealthy     People who think fitness is some 2 week ordeal     People asking ridiculously generic already answered questions       Often times these posts are met with a fair bit of hostility (rightly so because they're fucking stupid) and once the OP get's hammered with some comments pointing that out, they seem to  always  get defensive and spout some shit like:   "humph, I though r/fitness was full of attractive, supportive, intelligent people that would help me decide between black and brown shorts, I see now I was wrong, GOOD DAY
I won't argue that it  needs  to exist, but I'll give it a shot at why hockey is a bit different from the other sports.   My main argument is going to revolve around the idea that fighting is generally players policing themselves for what they consider inappropriate or particularly hard hits even if legal. In football, players have the time in-between plays to get out their anger. It is very common to see shoving and pushing after a big hit to a QB for instance. Now imagine if the football players were moving twice as fast on a much more unforgiving surface that would arguably result in double the potential for injury. The potential to purposefully cause an injury to an opposing player is significantly higher in hockey than in football due to speed at which it's played and the lack of defined "You can't cross this line" areas. The fighting allows players to get out their aggression in a safer environment than the actual sport they are playing.   Allowing fights in hockey allows players a "cleaner" and more fair way of expressing their aggression. Instead of cheap-shotting a guy into the boards, they trade a few blows instead.   Additionally, it's fun as hell to watch and is tradition (which by itself is never a good argument, I know).
Building other units depends on strategy but also your opponents. I can imagine you've been playing vs AI and can get away with just building the starting unit. But the game is completely different when matched against other players and its much, much harder to use a single unit mid to end game and live to tell the tale.   Not only do your other units give you different stats but they also have their own unique abilities which are major for tactical battles. The second thing I'd like to mention is that economically wise you would also have some issues.   You have a single unit that you need to retrofit all the time. The further down you go through the ages (research) the more expensive they will get.   If you play the wild walkers you can make economical and strategical decisions, for example only investing in attack for your ranged units and defense for your melee units.   So heres an example:   Youplay the necrophages and use the default unit. Its pretty avarage all round but is very cheap. You max it out by retrofitting and you're done.   I play the wild walkers and choose to build the ranger and max out it's attack only. And I research and build a Tanei walker that has high HP and Defense.   So for arguments sake lets say a weapon gives +10 attack and armor +10 defense. Your forager will go from 22 attack to 32. And 34 defense to 44.   Now I spend the same amount of money on my units but I split it to their most effective stats. So I get: Ranger attack 42 to 52 which is more than yours. My Tanei walker defense goes from 46 to 56 which is more than yours. Next to that I can position my tanei in front and rangers at the back. Tanei block you and take the blows, my rangers deal lots of damage.   Also If I simply place my units inside a forest they get 50% attack bonus. You only spread some disease damage, but considering my Tanei is defending and has loads of HP, they will have no issues with it.   Hope this kinda explains how I would approach combat and why it's worth researching other units.
Not a teacher, but one of my friends in high school got a hold of one a those "compact mirrors" (that girls use to put on make-up) and put it in his shoe just before the test. He then took his notes and taped them to the bottom of his desk. Since he was wearing loose fitting shoes he was able to slip his foot in and out to see the sheet throughout the test, whenever the teacher wasn't looking.
Is this a serious response? How in the world is Christianity incoherent without a community of believers? There are how many sects of Christianity out there today? I guess that's because they all got together and agreed, right?   It actually says in the Bible how you're only meant to take your family to the place of God twice a year. Anything outside of that is religious, and the only religion God accepts is the one that feeds the poor and takes care of widows.   All those groups of people in church are just part of nice little sects outside of Christianity that continue to separate and divide people because of conflicting doctrines.   The body and church of Christ is comprised of his chosen ones and the Gentiles. He spilled his blood for everyone, not just the select few that manage to go to a white collar church and feel good about themselves while they ridicule Jesuits, New Age'ists and w/e for their conflicting doctrines.   Don't confuse yourself, Ludi. God works marvelously beyond the limitations of your stone and mortar buildings. The entire world is his congregation. Everyone just wants to get up in a tizzy and separate themselves from their brothers because 'we're more right than you' - thus you have a confused, fragmented, and brotherless 'other' religion that God worked to prevent.   If you recall, God originally hated the idea of a temple, but David wanted to compete with all the other religions in the world, thus the temple came about. Prior to that it was a huge tent that a bunch of people went to go to to talk about God and all those wonderful things (if it was necessary).
Probably not. The security is absolutely top-of-the-line there (several military platoons deployed, police brought from across the nation) and I don't think that anyone will be prepared for how rigorous the checks are there.   Always take everything with a grain of salt, especially from big meadia outlets. Back in 2002, with the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the Russian press was saying the same shit about how the 9/11 attacks are reason to believe that the Olympics will be attacked as well.
Hi!   So a few hours ago, I went into one of the Phantom servers that I found on reddit so I could find some people to go down the elevator with me. Most players in the server were friendly and helped me.   So, I got down to that secret level, picked up the bow, then climbed up the shelf to unlock that assignment. I saw that big icon pop up on the screen as I pressed E on the papers.   After a few minutes playing with the bow while helping people find the dog tag, some guy kept on shooting me. I didn't want to hurt him, but also didn't want to die, so I headshotted him with the bow as I almost died.   Few seconds later, he must've typed in the kicking command, and I was kicked. I read a post some time ago about how being kicked or disconnected from a server will save the stats you earned as long as the server ends. I don't know if joining back will reset those stats earned, so i didnt take the risk so i waited.   An hour passed, and I checked my assignments. I clicked on that last Phantom assigment, and it still seemed to be locked as it only displayed that question mark. I was kind of worried, so I went to a server to check if my bow was unlocked...  Thankfully, it was.
Finally, a clear-headed answer in the mist of all of these "justice" comments. Sure, that "bronze" guy is an idiot, but the "punishment" of his illegal action is for Riot to decide not some random player that serves "street justice". When he gave his log-in info, combined with probably a screenshot of log-in into his account would probably suffice for Riot to serve "justice" Riot deems appropriate.
I've got to hand it to you for realizing fat-shaming and thin-shaming are two sides of the same coin. Go you!   On another note, I grew up in Orange County, a part of southern California that's known for its [rich white douche-bags and insanely high standards of beauty]( I struggled with body image crap for most of my pre-teen, teen, and adult years. I moved to the San Fransisco area to go to college and I was blown away by how many people suddenly found me attractive and wanted to date me.  It was like night and day. It made me realize how arbitrary other people's opinions of me are and it really just matters whether or not I am happy with myself. It's stuff I still struggle with, but being in a place where I feel accepted and can focus on what matters to me helps a lot.
First post so hopefully I'm doing this right.   My story happened this evening, and its frustrating me so much that I can't fall asleep. Finally made an account after lurking for years, to share this and see if anyone else has been in the same boat!   So today we were went to Jade factory today and did a tour. This is where they tell you about jade and show off their pieces. It's thinly disguised as educational but is basically a 'shopping' visit. After being warned beforehand, and also being fully aware that the Attendants would be pushing sales, I thought I was safe.   It starts fine. Attendant talks about how jade is made etc etc until the big boss of the company walks past in the background. Suddenly the attendant is super polite and tones down her talking. The boss comes over instead and spends the next 20 mins or so telling us about the origin of his store and mixes it up with his life story. I'm still firmly adamant at this point that I would in no way be buying anything.   This is the point where things start to get hazy. Boss all of a sudden calls his Attendants to fetch special little gifts cos he likes us so much. Everyone in the tour becomes really happy and this is when he mentions he's personally going to sign off on a massive markdown for the small goods on the table, just for us. Everyone gets more excited and starts grabbing like no tomorrow.   This is where it gets intense. Boss comes to me and starts chatting about my hometown and how he's going to visit there soon. We get talking and after a while he pulls out a most 'treasured' jade set to show me.   Long story short, this guy is so f-ing smooth, I had my credit card out and brought the set in a blink. Massively regretting it after getting home. I had fallen into the exact trap I concentrated so hard on avoiding. I have no idea how he did it, but its pissing me off so much. Mainly because I knew it was coming yet still managed to get caught even though I pride myself on being smarter than the average Samaritan.
The game needs both, more viable generators and a stronger %AS (and possibly also +Damage) stat to have more build and gear variety aside from which % Elemental Damage you stack.   The problem, I think, is that Blizzard is still stuck with a mindset that balancing DPS, Toughness and Healing leads to the best results. %AS theoretically provides utility in the form of more resources, more procs (e.g. stuns) and more LoH. Practically all of that is irrelevant as long as it provides significantly less character sheet DPS than other stats and even less effective DPS so you kill stuff a lot slower, resulting in a lot more healing required to begin with. Also there's no place for LoH as a primary affix on gear so any benefits to LoH are usually only benefits to your Paragon LoH.   Not to mention, if they tune the game into one where you  need  primary affixes for healing, that'll just create an imbalance amongst classes which can avoid damage the most (e.g. DH) and thus get away with the least primary affix slots wasted on healing and classes which have a hard time avoiding damage completely (e.g. Barbs) and thus need to waste a lot of affix slots on healing.   Overall, stacking %CC and %CD provides such a huge damage boost that, even if you doubled the %AS on every item, you'd still never be able to avoid %CC / %CD completely. E.g. the 54% Crit and 534% Crit Damage of my DH result in a total damage increase of 288.36%. Assuming, %AS was doubled, you could get 14% * 4 = 56% on slots that you'd usually have Crit on (Amulet, Gloves, Ring x2). You'd still need another multiplicative 149% damage increase from affixes you can get instead of %CC / %CD to be even with stacked %CC / %CD. That's simply not realistical unless Blizzard buffs some other stat such as +Damage to ridiculous levels.
I work for a local craft brewery and the other day a woman came in to order a growler fill for her husband. She didn't remember what kind she liked but she knew he didn't like Belgians.   I really don't get the hype about Belgian beers. It's probably a personal taste thing, but I just find their wheatey sweetness and lack of complexity/flavor depth to be rather meh. Double IPAs, Porters, and Stouts are the way to go.
have been married for around 6 or 7 years.   I'm sorry but I have no sympathy for someone that would lie to another human being they supposedly care for, for that long. I get that he had gender issues but he could've either remained unmarried or found someone who accepted him the way he wanted.   Your sister's life is now turned upside down. She thought she had found her soulmate and had a good marriage and now she has to start all over.   > throws on his woman clothes, goes by the name Erica, etc. He even travels to other cities where he has transgender friends on the weekends, without J, so that he can fully be dressed as and act like a woman.   Does he have  no respect  for his wife? Can he not wait until the divorce is over to do that? Must he subject her to this? If something like this happened to someone I loved, I would be sympathetic but I would offer no support to the person that hurt them.
I think you guys are getting too worked up over a movie that doesn't even have a script yet. Just think about what you're doing. You're getting extremely angry because Michael Bay said something off hand in an interview. You don't really know how it's going to play out, or whether or not it's going to end up that way. Michael Bay says a lot of shit during actual filming of Transformers that wasn't even remotely true to try to keep a few things secret. Even if it's true... someone has said that aliens were involved in making the Ninja Turtles the way they are in the original comics, so maybe it's a variation of that.   I love Ninja Turtles growing up, I watch the cartoon and played with the toys, but I understand that just because somebody is trying to bring something I loved as a kid to a whole new generation, it doesn't destroy what made me fall in love with it in the first place. That shit is STILL there, what's why I never understood the sentiment behind someone saying how a director is "raping my childhood" just because they're updating it.
Warning: Sad Story.   On Friday October 17 at 11 am, my girlfriend decided to end our relationship because she was young, inexperienced and the emotional strife was too much to deal with (and rightfully so).   That being said, it still really fucking sucks.   She only ended it because of the distance, not because of me. More importantly though, she didn't communicate with me that she was going through all of this pain. She was very stubborn, and very "self-reliant" as she calls it. To put some perspective on it, if I hadn't told her sister and her best friend about it, they still wouldn't have known. And they were as surprised as me when I let them know. Her parents still don't know. She's a freshman in college. She doesn't have that ample of an emotional support structure to cut out her family or best friends from this.   yeah, I know it was wrong for me to step in like that. But I freaked out and didn't know what to do or who to turn too. I just had a suspicion that she was going to try to tough it out on her own, so I told them to talk to her. She thanked me for telling her best friend later, but was still a little salty that I told her much younger sister.  I felt like shit after I did it too.   __   SAD/WHINY PART   The last couple days of the relationship, I was in the fetal position on my bed because i felt that my whole world was crashing down on me. School was kicking my ass, my grades were shit, and I was already suffering from anxiety and mild depression. But I didn't know why all of this was accumulating this week. I had to keep reassuring myself "she's just not with her phone right now, its ok. She just busy right now, she doesn't want to talk. She still loves you, its ok."   I was so overwhelmed with the stress on my side of the relationship that I couldn't pick up on the subtle signs that she was putting out. I was hurting because she was hurting, but I didn't know it.   When she called Friday morning I was relieved right before I was terrorized by how uncharacteristic this call was. By the time she had called, she had already stepped away from me, and settled her mind. When she called me, I was at the peak of my stressful life, worried why she was so distant. After she told me, she felt a relief, and I was paralyzed with sadness. I had enough sanity left to send out a distress call to my family. If they didn't come scrape me of the ground, I may never have gotten up.   __   IMPORTANT PART   The point I'm trying to make is that I am still struggling with the fact that I didn't know she was in pain. To be honest I don't know what more I could have done, but as I felt her become distant over the 2 days before the end, I started going online and looking for ways to make it seem less terrible. I had this subreddit up on my monitor when she called me.   That feeling of the failure in communication is crushing, especially when communication is the entire basis of the relationship   PLEASE,  if you are hurting on the inside from this, don't hide it from your partner. You have to let them know something. Maybe they can help, maybe they can't, but they need to know. You owe it to your partner to maintain the integrity of your relationship up until the very end.   __   LESS SAD CONCLUSION PART   As much as I want to say that I could have done things differently, I know that I committed myself 100% to this relationship and gave it my best shot. I shouldn't be frustrated with her, because I know she did the same. However, I still am slightly frustrated. But I think that these emotions are irrational cooping mechanisms to assign someone with the blame.  [<-- EDIT: I think I wrote this post so that I could bring myself to this conclusion.]   I do not regret this life experience in the slightest.  I'm so happy that I got to experience what love truly is, and I will cherish every memory I made with her. I still love this woman, and I have every intention of keeping her in my life. She means to much to me to do otherwise.   __
On that note, there isn't any sadness either. At least for me. It's just nothing. No fear, no happiness, no sadness, no desire, no nothing. I used to get terrified of creepy stories or horror movies, but now I can watch any movie without even blinking, and it's not fun anymore. I just want everything to be over, and I just wait the time to sleep. So depression is really... boring. I used to have serious panic attacks, and now I just don't have enough anything to start the panic episodes.  But I am in treatment. It is coming back, slowly. Sometimes I get that feeling that we have in the beginning of an attack, but there's nothing there to proceed. I just don't feel, so the anxiety that leads to the panic is... quickly.controlled. I never thought I'd want to be in panic, but life is getting senseless with no battles to fight.
I went to classes about 28 years ago. It was on a lark, I was in college and it was a way to relax, I enjoyed it. But then life got in the way, moved out of state, got married, had kids.   Then two years ago my son started college out of state and he needed one more credit so he took a yoga class. Made me start thinking about myself. When I went to visit him we went to a class together. I had forgot how much I loved it.   As soon as I got back home I started going to the classes at my gym. I'd watched those people with their little yoga mats go to class while I was sweating my butt off on those stupid machines. I realized I needed some zen in my life and after the first class I was hooked again.   I recently had surgery which has prevented me from practicing, my husband said on more than one occasion 'Don't you have a yoga class today? When are you going back to yoga?' He could see the difference in me, before and after.   I was able to start going back this last week, limited motion, but the instructors work with me and I know how to modify the positions to accommodate my restrictions.  My husband noticed the zen in me right away. Which led to a conversation we had just last night. We've always been the same height and I offhandedly said yoga makes you taller. He didn't believe me. I told him the last two times I've been measured at my doctors I've been an inch taller. He didn't believe me. So I made him stand up. He said 'Fuck me, you're an inch taller!' I laughed so hard I hurt myself!
Mines wasn't a date but a one night stand.   I went to watch a band playing in my local town with two friends and we arrived in the city center a couple of hours early, so we went to a bar and started drinking. Then when we arrived at the venue there were about three support bands so we got more drinks and watched them. Eventually the main act came on and we had another drink whilst watching them. We were all fairly drunk by this point. The original plan was to go home after the gig as it was a Wednesday night and that is usually quite a dead night clubbing/bar wise, however 5 pints of cider makes staying out sound so much more appealing.   We left the gig venue at about 10.30pm and headed over to a club night that was just starting. We just kept drinking and drinking until I was about 11 pints in and a slightly curvy girl approached me and asked if I wanted a drink, then asked me if I wanted to go out and chat with her outside and I agreed. Eventually and I can't remember how we were furiously making out and then left the club hand in hand and I had the bright idea of taking her back to my place with my parents sleeping next door.   We get back to mine and I managed to Ninja her into my room without anyone hearing. I stripped her naked and kissed her with some passion (quite surprising considering I'd never seen a girl naked before that), I then lay her on the bed and sucked her tits and eat her out to the point she was quivering and couldn't speak.   From this point onwards it starts to go wrong. She tells me all about how she wants me to fuck her against her kitchen table before I've even put my dick in her. Problem was I had drank so much there was no way my dick could function so I just said something to the effect of "I'll fuck you in the morning", rolled over and fell asleep. The morning came and I woke up still very drunk and tapped her on the shoulder and she smiled and started kissing me, I ended up eating her out again and she loudly moaned "I can't believe you've never done this before!" but again my dick just doesn't want to play ball so I just fell asleep again.   I wake up about three hours later, this time a lot more sober and beside me see not a slightly curvy girl but a hugely fat one. Immediately I think "oh shit what have I done". I then realize that I have to sneak this girl out of my house without anyone noticing, which I manage...just. However I now have the awkward chat back to the train station with her in which I deliver such classics as "Thanks you are really good at all the y'know...dick sucking", "Were you serious about the whole going back to yours to fuck?" and when she was about to get on the train I actually said "I don't really know what to do in these situations because it doesn't happen that often". All of that combined to make probably the most awkward experience of my life.   Not quite drinking piss bad but bad enough for me.
Worst, way too many to list here. I was a concert shirt wearing skateboarder in the early 90's. I was apparently a menace. I've been shoved, hit in the chest with a flashlight all without any provocation on my part, seriously they would pull up and just harass us. We were not skating on sidewalks or messing up property. We would be on our own private property.   These were the young cops that came out of high school and joined the academy. They knew us and hated us because we were, as one cop put it so eloquently "Shit Bags". Gotta love small towns.   Best. Once again way too many to list. Same town. A couple of the older cops would come down, hang out, drink some beer, (off duty of course) and watch us skate. They would actually cheer us on when we landed tricks and stuff. One Sgt in particular had caught us in the middle of the night tripping on Magic Mushrooms while walking to a 24/7 store, stopped us, searched us and found pot.   He said "I don't give a shit what you guys do, just don't do it in public. Go do it in the woods or something" and he let us keep our shitty brown weed.
The arguments about whether or not time-travel in LOOPER "works" or not after you consider all of the many, many, paradoxical issues has been going on and on and on in circles. It's almost poetic, considering.   But I wan't to put this to rest. I know that's impossible - because internet - but I'm still going to share something I haven't seen anyone else bring up, and it is why I believe LOOPER "works".   It comes down to this: is the universe RIGID, following strict logical laws that cannot be broken? or is it an organic, imperfect mess constantly in flux, adjusting and changing? The answer presented by LOOPER should be obvious. The fabric of the universe is flexible, and when we go fucking around with time-travel the fabric suddenly has to react and bend around the new reality being created by the choices of these time-travel-affected people (the time traveler and everyone he interacts with in the past).   Not to mention that from a writing stand-point this movie was clearly built around the EMOTIONAL STAKES of the story, so it'd be a fool's errand to try and force an emotional arc into a rigid time-travel logic when you could just make the universe a little messy and have it morph to fit your needs.   If anything it gives more power to the characters themselves than I've ever seen in a time-travel movie. The universe has to catch-up to them, not the other way around.
Everyone seems to think the US had no involvement in the battle of Britain or WW2 at all before we declared war, we supplied 20,000 Airplanes to the British and 42,000 engines a huge number especially considering that it was the RAF what won the Battle of Britain for the Allies. Without that support alone the British wouldn't have been able to keep enough fighters in the air to stop the German bombing runs. Thats not considering the fact that we loaned them pilots, supplied them with food, bullets, anti-air weaponry, and a host of other things essential for them to survive that siege. They would have probably given up after the devastation to their populace and their means of production made any attempt to defend against an invasion impossible.
I(21/m) recently had a great night with an older woman (37/f). She is a friend of my mother's so Ive known her for years. It was recently my 21st birthday so my mom, stepdad, and my mother's friend all had dinner together then went to a local bar for some drinks the night before my actual birthday. After a while my mom and stepdad were ready to but because I rode with them and don't live with them, her friend offered to take me home. Once we separated, it decided that my birthday celebration shouldn't end so early so me and the friend went out to another local spot for some drinks. After a while the night was coming to an end and where things would end up became the topic of conversation. Unfortunately it was brought up by some strangers we had been drinking with at the bar which made things uncomfortable pretty quickly. As it turned out she wasn't bothered at all and eventually asked what my thoughts on the matter were. I eventually admitted that I was into her and she did the same. The catch is that she is one of my mother's best friends and that eventually led to a mutual agreement that nothing could happen between us. While on the way home we talked some more with none of the awkwardness that might be expected after what happened in the bar and once again agreed that nothing can happen. We hugged and she dropped me off, putting an end to the night.  It's now been a couple of days and with the exception her wishing me a happy birthday the next day we haven't talked. I feel like I should say something but for a couple reasons I haven't been able to. One of the main reasons I haven't said anything is that after her terrible marriage she doesn't date and the last thing I want to do is seem clingy or needy or anything along those lines. If nothing else I want to avoid any potential awkwardness the next time we see each other because chances are we will be with my mom.  What should I say or do to at least minimize a potentiallly awkward meeting?
Scouts are for flanking and killing distracted enemy support classes. They should rarely be going 1:1 with soldiers or heavies; instead, they flank and take out enemy medics and snipers. They really only should be on the point if they are backcapping; the team/combo should be the people that cap the point. An ideal scout move would be getting behind the enemy team's line; the combo moves in and attempts to take the point, and the scouts obliterate the distracted and hurt enemies from behind. Then, the combo takes the point, and the scouts move onto it and help the cap before reinforcements arrive.   And if you can't 1:1 with pyros, you should practice more. With the edge of surprise, good scouts should always be able to 1:1 with any class. If there's a medic, of course the scouts should go for him first, but attacking a class on its own, even someone like a soldier, should be easy if he doesn't see you first.   On PL maps, there isn't much point trying to push the cart unless there are absolutely no enemies around (i.e your team has pushed ahead of the cart). Standing still while moving head on into an enemy's defensive line is just stupid.
Because we're sharing wedding stories...   I have a friend who's an army brat, with a close circle of army brat friends.  She was a bridesmaid at a wedding that never happened.  The wedding was in Puerto Rico and cost an insane amount of money.  I'm thinking >$70,000 from the descriptions.  Plus, the girl's parents paid airfare for all of the guests.  For weeks before the date, my friend told me about how she was packing beach clothing as backup, just in case the wedding trip turned into a vacation.  I asked her why.  Turns out that for a whole  year  before the wedding the bride and groom were having an open relationship.  She cheated on him several times while he was deployed, so they made an "arrangement."  My friend was taking bets on whether or not the bride would chicken out of the wedding.  Sure enough, the day of the wedding the bride disappeared and got together with some guy she was seeing while the groom was overseas.  My friend got to enjoy her all expenses paid trip to Puerto Rico.   Oh, and this was the bride's second attempted wedding.  Apparently, this girl had been under crazy amounts of pressure to get hitched and have a family.  Too bad her family never really got a clue after discovering she's a serial cheater.  They could have saved a LOT of money.
I had a little brother that was having a hard time with bullies. We told everyone and no one was doing anything. We had everything documented so I don't know what the real hold up was. He was terrified to go to school and it would make him physically ill. So we got tired of it so we gave him some step by step instructions.   Step 1: Tell an adult that a child keeps putting his hands on you Step 2: Tell the child directly to not put his hands on you Step 3: If he puts his hands on you again beat the living shit out of him. Don't let up until you have clearly and utterly won.   Needless to say he beat the snot out of that kid in front of everyone. Yes he got suspended but a few days suspension was well worth not having ANYONE bother him at school again. When the teachers were basically like " I didn't know he had it him." We just shrugged and said he was pushed to his limit and hope that nothing like this happens again. Said we will talk to him but also hope that the teachers are more vigilant. Our talk? Motherfucking ice cream sundaes to celebrate the end of him being bullied. We also explained how bad fighting really is but sometimes it has to be done and in the real world no one can put their hands on you without suffering immediate consequences.
Sorry if this is too late, since MJD already played.  If you went with him, your probably happy with 103 yds and 2 rec for 20 more.   The reason why I say its not close is because of the difference in each players floor.  We know that all three are capable of big games.   MJD on a few occassions has been given as little as 11 touches and he only averages 3.5 ypc (that's after last night's 7.4 too).  MJD averages 18 touches per game.   Stacy is averaging 22 touches per game and sports a 4.4 ypc average.  He also has the same number of TDs as MJD (5) in 6 less games.  In his first game he got 14 touches (all carries) and since then the only time he's been under 20 is against the Bears when he got injured.  Stacy also has not struggled in tough match ups (against the Seahawks he dropped 134 yards on 26 carries).   Cooper is tricker, because he plays WR (high variance position).  Cooper hasn't seen more than 7 targets this year and averages only 5 per game.  He averages less than 3 receptions.  The results have been better since Foles took over, but he isn't getting more looks, just converting a little more.  The exciting part about Cooper is that he is explosive with his targets and 5 targets could lead to 100+ and multiple TDs.
It seems like at some point, Dexter went from being a truly deranged person, who without "the code" would otherwise be killing small animals and the occasional hooker or homeless person, to some kind of a Batman-like superhero.   I'm not sure when the change happened but it seems like he transitioned from "a need to kill" to a "need to right wrongs (by killing)".  Along with that transition, he was also able to develop actual relationships and care for other people.  Rita started out as a beard but by the end, he truly did care for her and their children.
It's quite fun, but not great on the RPG side of things.  I've put about 6 hours in thus far (plan to finish it this weekend).  Some random thoughts:     The combat is well done.  You can imagine it as a vastly simplified Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale  style  combat.  Each of your characters have 4 abilities (and the skill trees can vastly change those skills).  You have to actually work to win in a lot of fights, even if you've played these style games before.   Combat is challenging in a good way, but there's not enough variety in enemies or encounters thus far.   The randomized loot is tedious and uninteresting.  This is sort of the "diablo 3 style" random loot, where there hasn't been really any choice.  Things are just better or they aren't, and you have to spend a bunch of time playing "fit the puzzle piece"   The story is meh, the voice acting is bad.   The areas you walk through look great, but they are pretty empty places.  There's no NPCs with random quests or cool stuff to find.  Everything is mostly:  Go a little off the main path, solve a minor puzzle or find a chest, fight some extra enemies, then move on to the objective of the area...  There's no depth to the world.
On the other hand, this can take some serious persistence.   A few years ago I (uninsured) had an accident that warranted an ambulance ride to the ER. All told, the hospital bills totaled something like $4000. My father, (a retired radiologist), told me I would have to call the billing department, explain my situation to them and negotiate a payment plan.   However, after two months of weekly calls, (twice a week at the start), I had been endlessly referred from one department manager to another and had made exactly zero progress. Then I got the notice that told me they were sending my bills to a collection agency who can start to negatively impact my credit rating and force me into bankruptcy.   My father and I started tag-team calling, and finally (I think because of his status as a retired doctor) my father was able to negotiate something like $1200, which I paid off as soon as possible.
I'm a 28-year-old male who is dating a 25-year-old female.   We've been exclusively dating each other for nearly 5 years and have been living alone together for about 3 years.   Neither of us want kids or want to get married.   I take saying "I love you" to a significant other to be a really big deal. I don't take that phrase lightly. In my past two long-term relationships (4 years for one and 8 months for the other) I told the other person "I love you" really early on in the relationship, and I think that wasn't the best decision. Too hasty.   I feel like my girlfriend and I do love each other. However, it's been so long now (almost 5 years!) that it seems kind of awkward and uncomfortable to finally say it!   I do tell her things like:     You're my favorite person in the world   I really, really like you a lot   You make me feel incredibly amorous   You're the best girlfriend ever     Any advice? I was thinking about just asking her something like, "how would you feel if I told you I loved you?"   It's been been so long now that anything explicitly love-related is awkward and kinda scary to me.
Background info: I'm a 4th year who is on track to graduate in May 2014. I didn't receive any interviews this recruiting season, which I believe is because I had 0 networking under my belt. I have a 3.55 GPA (with my senior accounting courses all closer to 4.0), I am involved in a lot of student groups, and I have various work experience including Accounts Payable from a summer job.   I am trying to do as much networking as I can this year, but it's tough because there aren't that many events that run all year long. I went to an Alumni Gala last week and although I made some connections with those representatives sitting at my table, it wasn't the type of event where you could mingle around and chat with different firms.   I've been trying to reach out and cold call some recruiters however they aren't responding. I tried connecting with some recruiters through LinkedIn by saying that "I have some questions about Firm and I would like to learn more about the overall company culture. I would like to connect with you in order to ask some specific questions and discuss life at Firm." I can see that "anonymous user is viewing your profile" but they are not accepting my requests or responding to me.   I could also send out emails by guessing what their emails are based on the standard for their firm, but I'm not sure if that is appropriate.   I could also try and attend other school's networking events in my area however again I'm not sure if that is appropriate.
Being inside a dark bathroom because of that stupid blood mary shit. My friends thought it would be funny to put me in completely dark bathroom while I was sleeping. When woke up I first thought I somehow turned blind but felt my way around and felt the toilet. At that moment I was freaking out because the door wouldn't open so I broke my friends mirror in his bathroom.
I like how all the composite images make for REALLY good looking people. That just goes to show a psychological fact: the most beautiful people are actually the most average people. Sort of like the Miss Korea pageant contestants all look very similar. Same with Miss America, and pretty much every beauty pageant. While we still have a fair amount of ethnic diversity in the US and our pageants don't look as homogenized as ones from other countries, you will eventually reach an ultimate "average" as the random obtrusive features are weeded out or covered up.
So recently I've been saving up a bit of cash to purchase a decent vape setup to help me quit smoking, and my girlfriend decided to surprise me by making the purchase for me while I was asleep. She went to the smoke shop down the street from our place for advice and they basically cornered her into taking their "Great" one time offer for their best battery.   She ended up buying an eGo-c Twist plus a charging cable for nearly forty bucks. Needless to say I was pretty ticked off cause that's about 3 times what It'd cost anywhere else and it wasn't what I was looking to buy. But it's supposed to be a decent starter so I wasn't too mad and just blew it off.   Then I got a little suspicious and decided to do some research and it turns out that not only did they overcharge her, the battery is a knockoff (No Joyetech logo on the bottom).   So aside from me just wanting to rant (sorry) I was wondering if there was any sort of action I can take. I'm going to try to return it despite their "no returns" policy, but I was unsure of the legality of the situation as to whether or not they are breaking any laws by selling this battery that clearly says "eGo-C Twist" on the side but is not a genuine product.Any advice is great, but sadly I'm sure I'm SOL.
You may not have given the clip enough time to watch it through but I'm going to take some time to respond to you, hopefully you'll be able to see the situation somewhat from another point of view.   I personally try to differentiate between the people fighting the wars and the ideologies of the people in power; in other words, the soldiers of the Wehrmacht are as representative of nazism as the soldiers of the Red Army are of communism: Not at all. Judging from your post, we are, more or less, in agreement on all this.   Where we differ, however, seems to be on the issue of Relic being right or wrong in portraying the Soviet Red Army the way they did. A big part of your post is a listing of soviet war crimes; and as stated many times before: no army has an untarnished reputation after that war, but this is not the point (Now, don't get me wrong, I fully apprecciate the seriousness of the horrors inflicted on people under Stalin's regime, but bear with me and I will explain why they should be irrellevant in the context of CoH).   Relic's first installation in the CoH was praised for it setting politics aside and focussing on what makes war interesting. Many people (me included) have been in periods where we found the german war machine highly interesting and I trust many of you found it relieving (just like me) to see the Wehrmacht depicted not as mindless drones doing evil for evil's sake, but rather a competent fighting force waging war against (maybe a slight bit "hollywoodised") american soldiers.   I think we can all agree that the same approach has not been taken with this, the second game. The sudden emphasis on war crimes might have taken many of us by surprise. I don't think many of us really expected Relic to go in this, the harshest of directions solely when depicting the Red Army and it's these inconsistencies that are infuriating the Russian community. If we are to include the politics in our war games we will never be able to have an undivided community, for it will always be animosity between the different groups. It is of utmost importance that we should be able to look at strategy and tactics objectively for the game, the community and the hobby's sake and not resort to squabbling like children about who is the worst of the worst.
I will say it again   >Why do you have such a problem with someone doing what makes them happy. She is not hurting anyone, She is not making you change, She is just doing what feels right to her and makes her happy. That is what I would define as beauty.
I see how this champ could be played as support but i also think he would be viable for top and mid but probably most viable as a jungler. The q gap closer then the slow would make for reasonable ganks and attacking creeps in the jungle all the time allows him to make use of his abilities, build wits end then triforce for tons of damage, or maybe even mashors tooth then lich bane for an AP jungler.
After two days of prodromal labor, I finally had my little girl! Contractions started Saturday morning (4/11) at around 9AM, coming at 15 minute intervals. After several hours they became 10 minutes apart, then 5. I was sure this was it. My contractions stopped that night while I slept.   The next morning (4/12), when I woke up, they immediately started back up at 4 minutes apart. They were quite painful, and I had to moan through them. After a couple of hours, they slowed down and petered out. Later last night, they started coming again, and were painful. My husband and I went out for an early anniversary dinner, and I contracted through the meal. We stopped at the store afterward to pick up a few things, and by this point my contractions were close together and extremely painful. I decided to come into the hospital to see what they thought I should do.   I got checked into my room, and the resident checked my cervix. I was 2-3cm dilated and 50% effaced, up from 1cm and 50% from Thursday. The OB decided to admit me, and I was hooked to the contraction and fetal heart rate monitors for a while.   I was checked again less than an hour later, and was at 4cm and 90% effaced. My contractions were about 3 minutes apart. They started a saline drip in case I wanted an epidural. I decided to get in the tub to try to deal with the pain. It didn't help with the pain, but brought the contractions on very strong and close together. I got out, and was at 6-7cm and 100% effaced. I opted for an intrathecal, which is like an epidural, but kicks in faster and doesn't last quite as long. It was placed, and within one minute I felt absolutely nothing. It. Was. Glorious.   It was then that I finally did my admittance paperwork. After that, I dozed on and off for a little while. I woke up, told the nurse I was starting to feel a pressure in my vagina, and the doctor came in and checked me again. I was fully dilated, but with intact waters. The doctor decided to break my water and get things moving along.   The water was full of meconium. This meant I wouldn't get immediate skin-to-skin, and my husband couldn't cut the cord.   I began pushing. The baby was at +1 or +2 station at the start of delivery. I could hardly feel anything, so I wasn't sure if I was pushing right. It turns out I was, because within seconds the baby was descending. She came down so fast that she got stressed, and was having heart decelerations, so the nurse tucked a pillow under my hip. This helped the issue. I continued pushing, and the doctor told me there was a full head of dark hair, just like my first daughter. She had me reach down and feel the head. On the next contraction, I delivered the head, and the rest of her on the one after. She had the cord wrapped around her neck and body.   The doctor cut the cord quickly and the pediatric team scooped the baby away to suction her out. She started gurgling and coughing just after. Meanwhile, the doctor delivered my placenta, which was coated with meconium.   I had one small skidmark tear on my labia, and didn't need any stitches. I have been bleeding a bit more than the doctor would have liked to see, but it's slowing down a little now.   In total, I was in actual labor for 5 hours, and pushed for just 9 minutes. Chelsea Brianne was born on 4/13/15 at 12:54 AM. I was 39 weeks and 4 days. She is 7 pounds, 5 ounces, and 21.5" long. She is absolutely perfect and I'm so in love :)   [Cuteness!](
I ran through forest of fallen giants and exhausted all available paths, and was hinted that Heides Tower of Flame was the next place I should head. After going down the path I found the gate in the little splashway and found there was no button prompt when I approached it. So I went back to Majula,  sure that I missed something in the forest. Went through the forest again. Nothing i could pick out. Went back to Majula to the pit. Died. I was losing hope, I felt like an idiot for getting stuck on what seemed was the first level! So after another day grinding out forest i decided "fuck it im checking out the gate again." Went down there with a torch that time. Found the pull-ring immediately. Sat my controller down, went outside and smoked a cigarette and contemplated the last day.
Sorry for the lame title. but essentially,  I was having horrible problems with my cell phone carrier (which is another story) so I decided to cancel and switch to another carrier. I was charged a $600 cancellation fee, and I was disputing it because of the issues I had and felt they should waive it.   There was an additional $200 that I was being charged as well which I was also disputing. In the meantime, they sent it to a collection agency, and the collection agency (from here on called ABC) offered me an additional 15% off if I paid it by a certain date. I didn't want to ruin my credit, and I was sick of dealing with the cell phone carrier, so I paid the $680. This was about eight months ago.   Last week another credit agency "DEF" started calling me for $120 on behalf of the cellular phone company. I told them I already paid it months ago, and they told me it's my problem, and if I want them to stop calling me, I need to get the cell phone company to call DEF and tell them so or produce some kind of letter from them.   So I called the cell phone company, and they said they have a record of me paying the $680, but I have to deal with ABC credit collection agency about the remaining $120 because they don't know anything about a 15% discount. The cell phone company rep was really helpful, and said he thinks sometimes the credit collection agency just says stuff like that so that the person will pay and they can collect the commission..  and thinks I may have been scammed, and that I should look for any written communication, and find out who I had talked to etc, and get credit agency abc to call the cell phone company.   I've been trying to call ABC credit collection agency, but if I can get anyone on the phone, they won't help me.   Would you just pay the $120? I don't want to ruin my credit anymore than I already have. And I don't exactly want to spend so much time on the phone being put on hold and re-explaining and get more frustrated. I'm more upset about the whole "principle"   I realize working at a credit collection agency is a tough job, but some of the people I am talking to are real jerks if I can even get one on the phone to help me. I guess they aren't getting paid to resolve stuff like this.   Not that this matters now, but I'm quite sore because I shouldn't have even paid any part of the $800. The problems I had with the cell phone company were horrible, and I believe I am justified in not paying them and if I had the time and money, I would actually sue them. I've met other people since then that have had similar issues, as well as a former employee and I am not just some whiny customers trying to get out of the charge. In fact, it would have been cheaper to just stay with them for the rest of my contract, but out of principal, and just seeing their monthly bill got me seething because of all the various issues I had so I switched carriers. Sorry to go on, I'm just bitter I guess..

I'll try to make this as brief as possible. I'm a gay male, btw.   So I met this guy through a friend, who is a girl. They would make out, he would treat her very special (putting a picture of her up on FB and all, was very touchy and affectionate). She really liked him at one point. They went to Prom together. He also went to another prom with another girl, but told his friends to keep it a secret. Whenever he was confronted, he told my friend "we're just friends".   He had a girlfriend later that year. He apparently told everyone how much he likes her and how much he wants to be with her. So they started dating. But immediately into the relationship he would flirt with other ppl. He broke it off. The relationship lasted a month.   I have heard of 2 other girls who simply told me he would be super touchy and affectionate and felt led on, and he told them "we're just friends" when confronted.   Then there's me. I was resentful at first but I found him super attractive so I didn't mind how sweet he was being to me. He would constantly compliment me like no one else had before. He would constantly say "I love you" to me. Held my hands numerous times. Said stuff like "if I had to watch one guy getting head, it would be you" "if there's one guy in the world you would make out with, who would it be?" "if there's one guy in this group you'd make out with who would it be?" "I wish I could just be in your arms forever" "Why do we have so much sexual tension?" (and when I asked him a week later why he said that he avoided it completely) "Why do you have a crush on me? Like why?" "What would you do if I was gay and in the closet and came out to you?" "Eat this. Eat this or I'm going to have sex with you." "Sometimes, I just want to love you." Would also do things like constantly ask if I'm gay, get a Magic 8 Ball, ask it "is (my name) gay?" "will (my name) ever stop staring at me?" We would constantly deeply stare at each other, with silence. Constant flirty banter. He was incredibly touchy.   At the same time, if I ever initiated something tiny, he would freak out and say "man, we need girls" or would constantly say that in general "we need girls"   etc etc. you get the idea. And believe me I made it very obvious I liked him. He was so ridiculously flirty that others would make comments all the time.   I ended up coming out to him, and he said it was all a joke, and that he had no idea anything was gay.   Then 3 weeks later he started telling the entire world that he's in love with some girl, that he can't stop thinking about her, etc.   He told ME to go be his messenger and tell her to give him a chance (brief history: they made out once a little over a year ago, they were barely friends, and that's about it). She was weirded out and asked "why couldn't he say this to me? Why you?" etc. and she didn't believe it.   For almost a year he would blame me, saying I ruined things between him and this girl and made me look terrible. People would also tell me that he would get insanely mad that I told him in private that I personally think his "thing" for this girl is an infatuation.   Then people slowly started realizing that he had no reason to blame me and that this is all on me.   Then shortly afterwards, he got a girlfriend. This girl, he already knew for almost a year. She was already very into him.   Also, when he finally got a gf, he finally said to me "oh, by the way, you were right it was just an infatuation. I mean, I diiiid like like her but yeah." Only when my friends forced for him to talk to me.   Anyways, they dated, and I told people that it's definitely not a genuine relationship, that he's only doing it to have a girlfriend. A lot of people commented that they barely give off a vibe. He never took her on dates. He ended up flirting with other people while he was dating her.   Now he broke up with her. Saying he "needs space." And she feels very led on.   So I have to ask... what is the deal with this guy??? Is he a very closeted gay, is he a sociopath, what???
It was Seth Rogen's worst performing movie at the box office (for years, until 50/50) at a time where he was possibly the hottest star in comedy. Even "Observe and Report" had a better opening weekend. The poor marketing and bad choice of opening weekend (Halloween) are typically accepted as to why it did so badly. As a result, Kevin Smith had a bit of a meltdown and has not since produced a comedy movie that he has written. Because of all this, it's a fairly common opinion that this is a terrible movie that killed Smith's career, and tarnished Rogen's. It's only in the last year or so I've noticed people online praising it, now that the movie has been removed from the controversy and issues around its release. That's how I see it anyway.
Was in roughly the same boat (never having actually asked a girl out and had relationships all come from friendships).  I had put off making moves for some more important reasons, but among them ambiguity as to what her interest would be.   I recently decided to just go for it (although it was pretty easy considering she appeared to be quite unique, and it was the last time I knew I would be able to do it in person).  The main thing that drove me was the realization that we're fucking old enough to ask people out and be straightforward. That doesnt mean you need to spill your heart out to her and scare her away, but you can drop a sentence or two about why you are interested in her and just ask her out on a date.   It's really not that bad, and honestly is sooo much better than waiting and thinking about what they might think.   She either likes you, doesn't, or might be open to liking you.  But really fuck it who cares if she likes you at this point.  Don't think about it as though you are asking her to start a relationship, but if she's interested in going on a date to see if she's interested in starting a relationship.  She might already like you which makes it easy, she might have ruled you out, or she might not have ever thought about you that way.   It might not work out for you.  It didn't for me (although it wasn't entirely bad).  She was entirely flattered by what was said and it was painful because she said she would have said yes, but for timing.  She and an ex were working towards getting back together and she didn't want to mess that up (but if it doesn't...).  It could have been a nice letdown, but judging by what she said after it really did seem as though she was bummed about the timing of things.   So what's the moral of the story? You're putting your life together and taking hold of it.  Stop waiting for things to fall into place and guide them into place by just asking.  She might say yes, no, or a even more polite/rude variant of those two.  But just know this, you'll be one step closer to where you want to be after you ask her.  Even if it's not with her, you'll have far more confidence the next time you ask someone out. Honestly even if she had no interest before you could trigger something.  In my case i'm left wondering what if I didn't wait so long to ask her out would the timing have been different?  Don't let that happen.  SEIZE THE MOMENT!
Hello /r/relationships, So for the past month or so, we've been hearing a strange knocking in our house. It was always in a rhythm of 3 (or 6 sped up) and would last anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute. This would happen no matter what the time, so we could hear it at 5pm and we could hear it at 2am.   It was starting to drive me bonkers. My SO works nights, so it's really unsettling hearing things like that when I'm home alone, as it could be heard from our bedroom too.   Well the past couple of days we've gotten so fed up and we just HAD to know where the sound was coming from. Now Reddit. I'm starting to wish I hadn't.   We had traced it to coming out the front of our house. It would get louder when we opened the front door but we still couldn't trace it. Then this morning when it started again, I stood outside and had a pretty good look, and I've never been so weirded out in my life.   Stood in the hallway of my next door neighbours house, was one of the adults who lives there, just standing there, twisting the lock on the door and making the rhythm. I ran inside to tell my SO who seemed to believe me but I could tell he had his doubts.   So when it started up again just now, 10:45pm, I went and filmed it and he came and saw for himself and confirmed what I saw.   What is going on Reddit? Why are my neighbours being weird and creepy. We would've knocked to see what was going on but we're already cautious of them and it was so late.   My friends seem to think it could be sleepwalking or a form of OCD but I really don't know. My SO is gonna knock tomorrow and show them the video clip and ask about it but I thought I'd post here and see what your reactions are?
I just wanna make a small point here. I have no idea what happened to this user, but in a hypothetical situation where you are banned from a service even while being completely innocent, how would one possible summon up evidence proving his innocence?   It's a famous double edged sword, and being banned from cheating in games is even worse so. Most of the time the service won't tell you what and how anything was detected as to avoid a cheater being smarter the next time around.
While I was attending the Art Institute of Seattle I applied for jobs at a bunch of retail places. I got an interview lined up at the Gap and really wasn't too stoked on the idea of working there. I don't wear that sheople shit and it was in westlake so it was always busy as fuck. Basically I regretted ever even applying. My roomate at the time bet me $50 dollars I wouldn't go full retard during the interview. I was a broke student and was low on rainier and bud so I hopped on that shit quicker than oprah on fried pudding. I showed up for the interview and it was your typical retail interview where everybody sits in a circle and gets asked the same bullshit like, "if you saw somebody stealing would you tell your boss or take a shit in the dressing room and let the thief take whatever they wanted." Obvious answer kind of shit. Anyways I came in, took my seat in the circle of the most hipstery fucks you can imagine and didn't say a word. The interview started and the first question was along the lines of explaining a situation where we dealt with a customer that was disgruntled and how we handled it. Everybody gave their answers, which were all the exact same, until it came to me. I took a deep breath, made eye contact with my roomate, who looked so excited/nervous I can still picture his smirk waiting in anticipation, and let out one loud, drawn out, obnoxious "DErrrrhUuuhmphhhhRReee!!" I then tilted my head and gave a huge confident smile. Only my roomate and one girl laughed. Everybody else gave me a look of disgust and the manager asked me to leave the store. I waited for my roomate to finish his interview, received my fifty dollars, bought a 30 rack of raiiiiiniiiieeerrr beeeer an never looked back.
So last night my best friend and I went to a concert together. We were drinking quite a bit and I got tired and overwhelmed by the crowd. About 30 minutes before the end of the show, I asked her a few times if she was ready to leave. She reacted REALLY angry and told me to leave without her. I was taken aback by her reaction - I think it was a bit overreacting. Well I wasn't about to leave her, especially since she was staying at my house that night. I went and sat outside the crowd, and told her where I was. I texted her to meet me whenever she was ready, no rush.   Well the concert ended and everyone cleared out - there was no sign of her. I called her and she said she couldn't find me so she was in a cab to the train station. I don't even think she looked for me, because I told her a distinct landmark that I was right in front of. But anyways, I got in a cab and followed to the train station.   Once I got there, I found her and gave her the ticket. She started yelling that I was being a bitch and I just apologized and asked her what I could do to make it better. She just walked away. She disappeared and did not sit with me on the train, and ended up sleeping at her ex boyfriend's house rather than mine. I texted her a long, sincere apology - no response. I haven't heard from her since.   Anyway, I think she should apologize for overreacting, but I know I will never get that out of her. We've been friends for 18 years and have had fights like this before. It always happens that everything is my fault and I'm a terrible friend, and she can do no wrong (not always true, of course).   I guess I just have to give her time? Any suggestions/comments/advice would be great! Even if you agree that I'm a bitch and deserve the anger :)   I haven't heard from her at all today. Also, we have plans to go to another concert on Saturday night. I want to text her and say "I totally understand if you want to take someone else" - thoughts?
I really was a fan of SteelSeries and some of their products until the BS that I as a customer had to take from there.   All started during the PAX2011 promo. I ordered a bunch of SteelSeries items (headset, mouse pad, mouse, earbuds) after hearing that they were a quality company that produced quality gear.  I had owned their headsets before (4H and 5Hv2) but never any other components made by them so I decided to give them a shot.   Upon my package arriving, I noticed that my SteelSeries 7H headset was not functioning (the left side kept cutting in and out). Thought nothing of it, I understand some slip through the quality control crack, whatever. I open an RMA ticket and am met with the usual questions such as order number, purchase date blah blah blah. Fill this out ship it back and around a week later get my new headset, works great.   Few weeks later the SteelSeries Kinzu I ordered beings to fail me. Apparently it was registering single clicks as double clicks which made for some interesting scenarios both while browsing reddit and while gaming. I open another ticket, get the usual questions and send it back (keep in mind im being forced to pay shipping for these products even though the issues they have are due to steelseries...).   While this mouse is being shipped off I end up buying a new mouse, the Kinzu white edition. I really do love the feel of this mouse since it has this rough plastic-like texture that makes it easy to grip and sticks to the hand. Mouse is working great.... till this month (January). The mouse seems to have some sort of sensor issue where it'll start to go crazy and spaz out until you give it a good whip around or lift it off of the mouse pad and reset its position (can view it in action here:   Im thinking at this point "I thought these dudes built quality shit, the hell is going on?". At this point im honestly beyond annoyed with the brand and their products. Three defective products in under 6 months? (got my stuff Oct 18th I believe). I start the RMA process again...   This time im expecting after my 3rd RMA due to a defective product of theirs they realize that this is something they should handle in full without expecting me to waste more money shipping back their defective products (really does add up when your buying insurance + tracking every time). Apparently 3 defective products later is not enough to get some recognition or some form of "above and beyond" support. I ask if I can be sent a replacement Kinzu at no charge (as in they send me a mouse + a shipping label and ill send this non-working kinzu back in the same box) which I believe is completely fair in this situation. Im basically told and I quote (directly from the ticket)   >I've done my best to compensate you for your issues. Upgrading you to a brand new mouse should be enough, considering the fact that a Kinzu could be placed in a standard padded envelope and shipped for less than $4 USD.   Now im asking myself after 2 RMA's due to defective products "Why am I footing even a portion of this bill when im not at fault here? These products were defective from their factory, it's not like I dunked them in a tank of water and am now asking for them to be replaced at their expense or something". I personally think its bullshit that after 3 defective products I should have to keep paying out of pocket to ease the burden on them when they are the ones sending out gear which is defective. I've tried to be reasonable and ive tried to understand. I know stuff slips past quality control, I know it's all luck of the draw but after 3 defective products id expect SteelSeries to have my back and do right by a customer thats purchased so much from them. All I asked was for them to cover shipping on this item and they wouldn't even do that for me... WTF -_-   Honestly, I expected a company such as SteelSeries to step up and knock this type of issue out of the park but instead they'd rather shit on me and act as if they're doing me a "courtesy" when all they've done is send me defective bullshit.   Thanks a ton SteelSeries. It's good to know that I spent over 300+ dollars on a company that wont have my back on an a small issue such as this one. Im a fan of you guys in the sense you support eSports and players but I will NEVER buy a SteelSeries branded product again until I know that you guys will do right by your customers.
I see where you are coming from, and it is as validl a conclusion as any. I just come from a very abstract, post modern/nihilistic view of social identity. At the end of the day you are only left with your own thoughts and feelings, and no amount of causes, philosophies, or politics will change your own perception.   To distinguish, I am not singing his praise, I am just saying that his perspective is as valid as any other. And yes, the hijackers fit into this category as well. I am not validating what they do, I am just saying that whether you want to free a country or blow it up you are still just chasing ideals that will not change any of your inherent perceptions. You are just changing how you interact with yourself.   As a man who spends his job taking the side of whoever retains his services, and also from just reading casually on cultural theory, I have realized that the only "right side" or "truth" is in the phrase "I only know one thing- that I don't know anything." You can read an entire modernist account of progress and science, then turn around and read the post colonial accounts of the people who were exploited to reach those modernist goals. The only thing that determines the right side is where your perception is. Same in this case.   It is equally valid to be a liberal comic book convention lover as it is to be a crippled war vet. They both come from the belief that they are 100% right. And they are right, subjectively. Objectively, there is no right. And any amount of trying to explain away the huge chasm between subjective and objective is just subjective in itself. What struck me about this comic was that even after having everything about his identity stripped away, the vet still clings to his ideals. It is not unheard of, but it is more passion than I have ever had for any idea which is why I connect with him. For somebody who is a humanitarian and wants the best for people they will side with the comic book guy. Once again, both subjectively correct.   We need to distinguish between what is rationale and what is faith-based. Those of us that are good at rationale, find that we have no faith and are passionless and thus we entropy in social activity. Those that have faith in their causes will tend to ignore any rational criticism against it.
The story that sticks out to me the most is when this one lady came in and asked for a fish bowl to keep at work. I tried to set her up with a simple betta set up but she REFUSED and started demanding that I sell her a large gold fish (he was probably about 3 inches across) that was priced around thirty bucks. I told her no, that it wouldn't survive. Then she starts going on about how this one woman she knows keeps HER goldfish in a bowl. Anyway, I ended up selling the woman the fish because my manager didn't want to hear her complain anymore. On her receipt thought I wrote DO NOT RETURN. Of Course it died and after a few days she tried to return it and threw a fit when we wouldn't give her what she wanted (plus she had tossed the receipt and I remembered her ugly face) . She threatened to never shop at our store again and I haven't seen her since. It's been awesome.
Here's a good guide by Westrice at Solomid. It will give you a good idea for masteries and runes. As for playstyle, be very passive before you get your ultimate and focus on getting as many CS as you possibly can get. Once you hit level 6, poking becomes much easier, as you deal tons of damage with Q. Speaking of, my preferred skill order is Q-E-W, maxing R at 6-11-16. Now, one thing you must know about akali in order to deal as much damage as you can : Casting Q then R immediately afterwards causes you to get to your target before your Q, wasting an auto-attack, therefore wasting your Q. The trick is to cast your Q and wait half a second to a second. Then jump at your target with R and enjoy seeing a good chunk of your enemies HP drop.
Now I have never trolled, so I don't have that need for anonymity.  However, I hate how "recorded" words, because they are typed, are so often taken out of context or misunderstood in some way.   My job puts me in the public eye and for this reason I remain anonymous online.  Not because I say dangerous or trolling things, but because "anything you say can and will be used against you" in the public eye, the work place, home, life, everywhere.   This is why I don't use Facebook and why I won't use Google+.  I've got an account in each, but they serve more as a public phone book--people who know me can look me up.  But I don't post anything about myself in those places.  I have seen too many people in my profession have Facebook used against them.  And I am tired of the number of times i hear, "Did you read what (insert name here) posted on Facebook??? I can't believe he/she would say that!!!"   EDIT   Here is another reason I remain anonymous.  Our culture (in America) is so damn polar.  If I say I am pro (insert political stance here) or if I say I'm against it, or if I imply in my online public conversations that I am pro or against it, then in comes the shitstorm from those who hold the opposing view.  Honestly, I do not care to have an argument with you, and, if you hadn't taken my "recorded" words so out of context, you may have realized we aren't that different to begin with.   EDIT   Speaking of "recorded" words.  This is why I think they are contently taken out of context.  First, in spoken conversations I don't think we realize how often we ask for clarification, or, simply by the way something is spoken, we more fully understand what someone means.  We forget how often we do this.  So, when we read a written statement, we forget that it may need clarification, or that the tone of voice is not there in the written word.  Instead we have words divorced from their context, read often hours if not days after they were written, and assumed to be written with the same care as the authors of the Constitution.   A perfect example of this is how a tweet from a game developer about an upcoming feature will be debated in an online forum for a 100 pages.  Posters will wonder just what was meant by the tweet.  Fifty theories will be espoused, two will make it to the top, sides will be drawn, before a dev will step in and say, "Guys, both of you are wrong; you took my words out of context."
Ok so this didn't happen today, but a couple of years ago. My dad is ex-military and a soccer ref and now a judge. Needless to say he loves keeping fit. One day he was benching at home, and had me spot him while he lifted. Heres where I fucked up. While I was spotting him, the TV was on, and I decided to pay attention to a football game rather than him. As I'm watching TV, I didn't realize that my dad was struggling with the weight, until I heard a pop and him yell in pain. Two years, multiple surgeries, and a lot of pain later, my dad's doctors still don't know whats wrong with him. I feel very badly about what happened and it sucks seeing my dad in pain
I'm a bit new to Adwords, I had attended a "speed course" in SEO and a day was spent covering Adwords but it was the one I struggled most in.   I've been tasked with creating a new adwords campaign to boost performance etc but I will be struggling for quite a bit while I get to grip with things again after attending that course 3 years ago.   I've set up a campaign initially with one ad group. This had around 30 keywords in it. I've left it around a week and it's cost £64.55. My top keyword is showing has having only 3 clicks but costing £2.42 per click (totalling £7.27) but the status is "Rarely shown due to low quality score".   I don't suppose anyone is able to explain this better to me or point me in the right direction where I can better understand realistic costs on what i'm doing?
It boils down to what we want to consider positivity I guess, sure comments with positive words like them will be considered positive by a computer, but does that count?   The  type  of positivity in a place like /r/minecraft is just very different, the same with other subreddits I visit. There is a sense of community, and posts (by viewers, not just by those who submit content) about how games like Minecraft has made a big influence in their life. People regularly talk about learning Minecraft with their kids, with their aging relatives, how Minecraft took them from depression, taught them how to use logic gates, or inspired them to make games. We sit around and talk about Mojangs policies (sometimes angrily) about the EULA and Patent Trolls and game design.   The type of positivity in gonewild involves a girl showing off her naked body and guys telling her she is attractive. Something that has been shown time and time again to happen even if they are not showing off their bodies for the male gaze (look at any post where a woman cosplays a character and she has large breasts, the top comment is often something pointing that out, even if it was not part of the cosplay). The comments  are  often creepy, and get downvoted or ignored, and it's just totally different than here.
So how exactly do we go about making bad pictures look better?   I've got this picture: [   After playing around with some stuff I got it to look like this: [   I really like the style of the second picture, could someone do some cleaning up and explain to me what you did so I can see how to make something like this better next time? You can either clean the second picture up or start from scratch with the original picture. Unfortunately those are the only two files I have.   I kind of want to smooth out some of the pixelation but I haven't been able to do that without making it look.. Odd. I'm in the process of playing around with the guitar too, it looks kind of boring compared to the rest of the picture...
I could make the same argument against the trend of supergun TDs that can kill in a matter of seconds.   Sure, you can't always "fight back" against the arty, but they die in 1-2 hits when exposed and are generally terrible in CQC.  A TD requires line of sight, so you  can  fight back, but he can also fuck your face off rather easily and can be as hard to kill as a heavy unless you catch one completely off guard.   I play arty, and yes fighting them can suck.  But given how every new line of tanks ends in a new mega-alpha doomcannon, does it really matter where the shell comes from when 3/4 of you HP suddenly disappears?   Getting nuked by arty sucks.  Getting one-clipped by an autoloader sucks.  Getting one-shotted by a FV183 sucks.
As an American I must admit i am a little biased, but here is my explanation:   Most people take issue with the actions of the American government, NOT the American people. Most foreigners that I have met on my travels actually enjoy and are impressed by American hospitality and politeness. They have a problem though, with the hegemonic government that does exactly the opposite of this. We invade shit, mistreat the poor, make fun of the rest of the world, pollute the earth, and wallow in ignorance and religion all while touting the ludicrous philosophy of "American exceptionalism"
I'm 31 and while I could never afford to play hockey, I played soccer instead. I've played in men's competitive, all divisions from bottom to top, and this is the last year I'm gonna play. Like the OP's experiences, soccer is the same shit - people think they're one step away from the big show, and that results in chippy on-field action and goonery that gives rec league sports a bad name. Even worse are the older guys that used to play competitive and are just playing to try and hurt / humiliate other players... in a REC LEAGUE. Next season, I'm gonna focus on going to the gym / cross training instead.
Hear me out! Cannabis is letting me get back to how I was before depression hit. It's stretched my consciousness out of that litte sad box, and it reminded me how good simply being can be.   As a result, I'm getting more work done, and enjoying every second of it. Adderall may satisfy giving you the energy to work, but cannabis gives one the joy to live, and thus to work.   If I'm a lazy pothead, I'm certainly less lazy than I was without pot. I've mopped the floors, vacuumed the stairs, and filled out applications to a slew of jobs and internship programs. My mom says I'm happier and more willing to spend time with the family. I feel like cannabis is being a good friend and taking away all the stress and worry of depression, so that me and my family don't have to deal with it.   Anyway, blah blah blah, cannabis is my anti-drug because it takes away the side-effects of the SSRIs and SNRIs, and picks up the slack where they left off. It does what Abilify is marketed for.   The only (bad) side effects are that I go into a stupor if I smoke too much (so I don't), and I get the munchies. But all in all, that's great as far as antidepressants go. Where's the suicidally? The lowering of the seizure threshold? The aversion to grapefruit? The lowered libido?   Seriously, this is good medicine.  What the hell is wrong with our government?
So... I saw the video starting in not-english, and I saw the whole site in not-english, so I went ahead and tried google translate to understand what was going on, and then gave up and came here wondering how anyone is understanding any of this without a translation, and then realized the rest of the video is in english - ___ -.
My whole life my mom has been WAY into scouting. She was the Blazer leader (11 yr old scouts) when I was younger, including when I was 11. She has served as an assistant scoutmaster, has been to woodbadge, and has even received the Silver Beaver award from the council for her service, so it is no doubt that am I an Eagle Scout, in fact, at one point I think I held the record for youngest Eagle Scout in my state.   When I got married and moved into a family ward, the Bishop knew my mom, and almost immediately called me to be the Scoutmaster. I went to roundtable, scoutcamp, campouts, scouts every Wednesday, YM leadership meetings all the time, and occationally had to teach deacon's quorum as well. As I got more and more into the system I started to see all the $ that had to be raised for scouting.   You aren't supposed to fund raise, so we offered a "flag" service where the scouts would come buy and put a flag in your yard 8x a year for a $25 "donation" to help the boys go to scout camp. I believe scout camp was $260 per boy for the Tuesday - Saturday camp, and that was for the "cheap" camp, the better one that I actually went to as a youth was $300+ per boy. The troop had very little equipment. When we wanted to teach the boys knots, I had to borrow ropes and stuff from my mom. For survival skills the boys had to buy their own flint and steel. No Troop tents had poles that weren't broken, so most boys brought their own. The uniform was amazingly expensive. I paid $100+ for a pair of pants and a shirt. My mom had tons of the council patches and the troop #s and the Scoutmaster patch that goes on the sleeve.   On top of all of the $ we raised to go to camp and pay for our activities, every year at tithing settlement we were asked if we'd like to contribute to "Friends of Scouting" I remember my mom giving $25 or something, every year. But now that I was an adult, I didn't understand what this was for. I asked questions, but nobody could give me a straight answer. Finally someone disclosed that each stake / ward is assessed a cost / year based on how many boys they have in the troop. For our ward, which had 10-12 YM total from Deacon to Priest, we were assessed about $2000. If our ward could make the cut, the stake had to make up the difference, which means one of the other wards had to pay more than their assessment to cover the wards that didn't. I was told this was to help keep the costs of scouting down and help pay for scout camps and things like that. The problem is that the boys all pay for that on their own. The Troop sees $0 from the friends of scouting fund. It is basically a "Franchise fee" so that you can call yourself Troop 666 or whatever. You get no discount on merit badges, rank advancement patches, camping equipment, fuel costs, scout camp fees or anything.   As I got more into I started talking with my brother who worked for an investment company that handled a lot of the Church's investments. He casually mentioned his displeasure with the scouting program after learning that the top level church officials all earned 6 figure salaries. This blew my mind. My whole life, our mom volunteered her time, and now I was volunteering mine to scouting, and the whole time I assumed that everyone in the scouting program was doing the same thing. I didn't really think about people "running" the program and making money. So where was the money going?   Last week in my new ward, they were collecting for friends of scouting, and so I took out my phone and looked up some info about the CSO (Chief Scouting Officer) of the BSA. he makes over $1M / year for leading a non-profit organization. He is one of the top paid executives for a non-profit in the US. I listened to the ward members drone on and on about how important the scouting program is, and that the YM program would be lost without it. Which is total bullshit. The YW program has no secular organization it partners with for YW activities. The YW in my old ward each had to raise the $80 it was going to take to go to camp, and each of them slept in cabins. On top of that, the BSA program is only attached to the YM program in the USA & Canada. Don't the European / Asian YM programs have a basic activities program like the YW? Why can't that work in the states?   On top of the $ is the "calling" factor behind the scouting program. In a secular BSA troop, the Scoutmaster is usually a person passionate about scouting and/or someone who is a parent of one of the scouts in the troop. They end up being excited about the program because they have a vested interest in it. They may / may not go to training to become a better leader, etc. In the Mormon version, it is a "calling" that someone accepts, along with that calling (at least in my ward and according to the church handbook) you are also the 2nd counselor in the YM presidency, and the adviser to the Deacon's quorum. You end up with people who do a pisspoor job, or who get burnt out because they are just trying to do the minimum amount of work to fulfill their calling and keep the bishop off their back.   I am so sick of the church's defense o the scouting program. Why can't the church just have a YM program the same way it has a YW program? I know that TSM is a Silver Buffalo, and while he is the leader of the church, nothing will change.   Don't get me wrong, I do like the values and skills that the scouting program taught me. I just think the same skills could be taught without the need for an annual extortion.   Is anyone aware of any "LDS against the BSA" or "Mormon's against Scouting" type organizations? Do you think you could get ex'd or disciplined for starting / being part of any such organization?   Not sure if this should be posted here or in the /mormon subreddit, but I feel like I'll get more of a straight answer here.
Genesis 1:11 - 27 , and He is speaking in first person.   In the second book of Genesis, we have a retelling of the some of the same events with a different order and a different perspective.   Genesis 2:7, 2:18 - 24   God made man from dust. He then made the plants and planted the Garden. He then made the animals. He then made woman from man's rib.  God is singular, and the actions are told in third person.   And then there is the subjective. The first book of Genesis has a more poetic and majestic feel.  The second book has more of a parable story feel, including the
Shame you have to
So to start this off, I want to prerequisite this by saying this is the first  serious  (I say that lightly) relationship I've had. With that out of the way I want to explain how I went about getting in this entire mess with this girl and the current situation I'm in. For personal reasons, I'll call the girl, "Katy" and the guy in question, "Billy." Also a slightly important detail is I'm still in highschool (1 month left) and she is 22 in college.   Okay, so around this time of year, I was hired at my current place of work which is a retirement home essentially. With that, I met Katy who worked there as a server (Which I was too) and Billy who was a cook. While working there I began to become interested in Katy but soon learned she was in a relationship with Billy. So I dropped it and went on with my life since she seemed to be in a good relationship.   Later this year is when I became more interested in her since we became pretty good friends and one day she told me about a certain other guy we worked with she went on a date with. This completely blew my mind since I thought she was still with Billy, so I asked her and she said she broke up with him last year.   None-the-less she ended up not liking this other work guy and we started talking A LOT. I mean so much that if I was up and awake and so was she, we'd be texting each other or facebook chatting, no matter what. We started hanging out a lot more, staying up till 3am, going out to eat, ect. So with me being still interested in a relationship with her I told her I liked her more than a friend and she felt the same way.   To cut thing shorter, we basically dated for about 2 months after that, she took my virginity, and soon after that I learned that she was still sleeping with Billy. I confronted her about it and she cried and apologized perfusely not wanting to lose me. She explained this situation as unintentional and it just happened. She couldn't explain it but she didn't like Billy.   This is when I learned that after their break up they were  still together with no title , as she puts it. They basically did everything a boyfriend and girlfriend would do but with no title. This confused me, I didn't understand it, but she reiterrated many times that she didn't like him that way and she wanted me. She said he was an asshole but great at sex and her stupid side of her took over. This pissed me off, still don't understand it, but I guess the stupid side of me still wants to be with her since she supposedly wants to be with me. So I forgave her.   A week later, (yes... a week) I caught a bunch of clues that she slept over at his house this past Wednesday and told her to tell me the truth or I'd be completely done with all of this. She told me she did and started crying again saying she was sorry, blah blah. She tells me they didn't have sex but she spent the night over. I don't know how true that is, but either way, it's the principle of her sleeping over at his house still. She goes on about how she loves me, doesn't want to lose me, and doesn't want to break my heart.   She texts me all Thursday begging me to give her another chance and do anything to regain my trust. This is when it all confuses me because it seems like she really does want to be with me. If she was using me in anyway I feel like she'd just drop it and cut her losses by now.   We went out for lunch and talked today and she basically explained again that she loves me, doesn't want to hurt me, and quote, "doesn't want to sleep with Billy, but can't promise she won't. I won't go out of my way to sleep with him."   This is where I become confused. I only thing I get in this situation is she wants Billy for sex and me for the rest? But she reiterates how she doesn't want to have sex with him but can't promise she won't. Can anyone explain to this to me? I really do love this girl, but I can't get my head around this. Thanks for any help.
I'm going to start off saying I was mostly raised by my single mother and older sister until my step dad came along. Years of "What not to Wear" and "Project Runway"   I love thinking of ways to dress up my girlfriend. To me she has perfect proportions and would look great in so many different outfits, I actually browse amazon for stuff I think would be fantastic on her and I went shopping with her not too long ago and picked out most of what she liked and got anyway.
I think but why would you prefer gpt over gold? The ai is unlikely to trade for any amount of interest unless they are losing a war. If you go commerce then your gold is already more valuable because you have higher purchasing power (your dollar is worth more) but to the AI its still 1g=1g so they have no incentive to trade for the interest rates you would need to justify the trade.
I have been online dating for about two years now and have had nothing but disappointment.  The person I was with [24M] last just ended things at random, despite having a great time together.  We had so many shared interests and would go on a bunch of fun dates (always shared the bill, if you're wondering.)  When we weren't together, we would send your typical cute texts and snapchat pics to each other.  He would send me texts saying "being with you is one of the best decisions I'll make" and would frequently make plans for our future.   Suddenly though that all changed.  He started to become more distant and not wanting to hang out as often and was always too busy to see me.  He also would reply to texts less frequently and was just generally more distant.  He broke things off a couple days later saying he had too many family issues and busy work schedule to include me in his life.  I noticed he had reactivated his online dating account though, so that was pretty much a lie because he apparently has time to look for someone else.   I just don't understand what could have gone wrong if everything was fine a couple weeks prior.  This is the third time I've been in this situation with someone I've been dating and I have lost trust in dating and looking for someone.  Has anyone else experienced this?
I am the one who posted his ascenson some time ago in [this]( post.   I swapped the  Corsair CX600M  for a  Seasonic S12II 620W 80 Plus Bronze , I had to struggle a little for the cable management because the CPU connector was a little too short, but I feel safer now. I also got a  Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO , and now the whole computer won't get past the 45ºC at any time (only the GPU does)   So I wanted to say  thank you  to everyone who helped me and to the whole community, there were some guys saying mean stuff on imgur but it's ok, I love you guys
I run a hotel, over the past year I hired 3 guys at my job, all 3 disappeared on us. Each one lasting a few weeks to months. 10 bucks an hour cash, 40-50 hours a week doing construction. Over time you realize that it's not the job they hate, it's not the wages they earn, it's work they hate. So they quit and then start over always resetting their earning potential.   They burn bridges, they lack any networking skills, no drive, no ambition, no entrepreneurial spirit and they certainly don't want to invest and sacrifice for their future with skills, schooling, and equipment. You feel sorry for them at first but then you realize how frighteningly stupid they are.   I would do everything to show them yes you can make lots of money laying tile, painting etc. Get the basic tools and skills and do side jobs on the weekends I'd tell them, I'd even show them how, but nope none of them did it. I even gave one guy old tools we had on the property. He quit, never took them. Just today months later he called presumably to get his job back, we didn't answer the phone. They rather spend money on a beer than a hammer. I'd tell them we can get you Obama care, get you some free schooling etc, none of them took me up on the offer to show them how.   Then we have a second class of citizens who earn just enough to skirt by on Gov benefits. Example, one day I said to a hotel guest who was way behind on her rent; the guy next to you is the manager of Publix, he said they are hiring. She didn't want to apply because they didn't pay enough. I told her they offer profit sharing and in a few years you'll be making decent money. She wasn't having none of it. This repeats it self over and over and over again until at which time they fall behind on their rent and we bounce them out.   You can't fix stupid and lazy and I'd say from experience those who are stuck making low wages into adulthood should look into the mirror first.
My roommate just got a black lab. His name is Otis and he is the runt of the litter. He got him in February of this year because of the attention the puppy and him will get. If it wasn't for me the dog would be spending 22 hours a day in a kennel. The small of amount of time my roommate has him out of his kennel, he completely ignores him. He is a hyperactive puppy trying to have fun and play but my roommate just pushes him away. He only interacts with him when he jumps up on his lap after giving up on trying to play. Fucking Douche Bag. Then one day he let him out in the morning and i was in my room sleeping. I here "Fucking OTIS!!!" and he had shit on the floor right in front of my room. Apparently he didn't let him outside when he woke up, so he took care of his business on the carpet. My roommate cleaned it up and then noticed Otis didn't have any food or water. This is when he stopped giving him more than 1 bowl of water and 1 bowl of food a day. He also hasn't taken him to a single vet. appointment, I have. He hasn't ever given him a bath, I have. Our lease is almost up and we're moving back home. That dog is going to die. I've offered several times to take him as my own but he claims he's too attached. I hope Otis runs away and finds a new owner and my roommate gets locked in a cage for 22 hours a day and beaten for every time he shits.
Mi sa' che la mia e' nuova...   3,5 anni , pranzo di famiglia allargato (dalla parte di mio padre son 7 fratelli sparsi per il mondo) io gioco con i cugini piu' piccoli (8 e 12 anni) sul fazzoletto di terra che i miei nonni ci avevano dato da gestire nell'orto.   Ovviamente al centro di questo gia' ridicolamente piccolo pezzo di terra sorgeva un imponente formicaio..   Cosa fanno i bambini con le formiche? Gli danno fuoco...   Ovviamente nessun adulto e' d'accordo e nessuno ci fornisce accendini o simili; trovando pero' una bottiglia di alcol e una scatola con 2, dico 2 fiammiferi decidiamo di fare un tentativo.   C'era vento e il primo fiammifero si spegne impietosamente davanti alle nostre facce ansiose.. Mentre il secondo fiammifero cerca di sopravvivere, la bottiglia di alcol (appoggiata al bordo di un leggero pendio) cade facendo  una fiammata. Il vento e la natura estremente sintetica delle tute anni 80 fanno in modo che i miei pantaloni prendano fuoco.   Mio cugino maggiore nel panico urla all'altro di correre a prendere dell'acqua e io che  non mi ero accorto di niente  gli corro dietro al grido di "Anch'io!".   Mio cugino maggiore quindi procede a placcarmi ed ad ustionarsi le mani nel togliermi i pantaloni. (non ricordo questa scena)   Ricordo poi di essere trasportato da mio cugino in una bacinella d'acqua verso la casa, di esser sotto la doccia a puntare dove faceva piu' male e mio padre che stava per tirare sotto dei motorini che non si spostavano dalla strada verso l'ospedale..   Ho cicatrici su tutte le gambe anche se, crescendo, la dimensione relativa delle stesse si e' ridotta.  Fortunatamente mai nella vita qualcuno mi fece pesare le mie cicatrici tanto che ormai mi ricordo/accorgo di loro solo quando una nuova persona mi fa domande a riguardo, ma effettivamente tra riabilitazione e trattamenti per la rigenerazione della pelle, elasticizzazione in fase di crescita, etc. ho fatto una vita un po' diversa dai bambini della mia eta'..   Al ritorno a casa dal primo lungo ricovero, trovai la casa piena di palloncini sopra la mia testa ed un Amiga 500 (Con espasione della RAM a 1 MEGABYTE) ad aspettarmi, facendomi così scoprire la passione per i computer: sono ora un ing. informatico con un lavoro divertente, challenging e gratificante..   sarebbe cambiato qualcosa senza l'incidente?   .
TOSE isn't really a "dirty little secret." They've been relatively well-known for years, and in any case, they aren't "really developing" the games you're talking about. They're  programming  them, which is altogether different. TOSE offers a lot of services, but the main thing they're known for is doing the so-called "grunt work" part of programming, the basic stuff that isn't related to the actual design or creative end of the games (although they do some other work, art and texturing and so on). So, with the exception of a few games (Starfy is the main example, I believe, and if I'm not mistaken they did most of Super Princess Peach), they aren't the "developers", they're just the programmers.   A good way of looking at it is: say you're a car designer. You build a really cool looking car that can go 0-60 in less than a second and run on sunshine and dreams. Then, you send the design to a factory in Mexico who actually builds the car. Did they "develop" the car? No, they just put it together for you. You were the developer.
Hey everyone, its my first story and I think it belongs here so here we go.   Years ago when I was 9 I was on my way home from school walking with a friend, it wasn't a long walk ( only 15mins ) and we were half way when we saw the mail man ( 25ish years old ). Being a lil kid at that time I got the brilliant idea of asking him for the mail of our adress so I could deliver it myself.   So I ran up to him and asked nicely if he could check for any mail on our adress. Strangly he didn't reply so I asked again, he kept walking and making some growling sounds so I got confused. Being young I had no idea on why he was ignoring me and I asked again. Suddenly the guy kicked behind him hitting me right between my legs, I was obv shocked and ran home instantly crowling behind the couch crying because the man even dared to ring our doorbell. He complained to my mom and I already told what happend to her and she ofc got MAD. She got his name, contacted his workplace and he got fired.
I have an absolutely brutal scar right down my stomach from an emergency appendectomy surgery. It's huge (about 6"), and pretty much cuts down my stomach in two through my bellybutton and makes my tummy look like a bum if I squish it in. Some days I absolutely hate it.   When I go out in a swimsuit, I'll wear a two piece. People stare occasionally, and I mostly find kids staring the most and looking at me wide eyed. Mostly I'm sure people think I've had a C-section or something, but quite honestly..   I've learned to not care. I know it's not the same as stretch marks, but it's something I used to be super self conscious about. I'd go out and try to cover it up as much as possible and be pretty damn downtrodden and shy away from people. Now if I catch people staring I just smile at them.
As a woman, I agree about cutting back on makeup (technically, our "actual needs" for makeup are nonexistant) but there might be some confusion about what's socially expected, which I want to try to rectify.   I only wear normal makeup for two things: fancy occasions where professional photos will be taken and the lighting is going to make my skin look awful (weddings, mostly) and job interviews or networking events where I need to feel uber-put-together and professional and, I guess, dressy.   But I own what seems a ridiculous collection of cosmetics for someone who almost never wears any. Concealer and foundation in two shades (one to match my winter/pale skin and one for summer/tan skin). Blush, because foundation kind of obscures the natural flushing of my face and makes me look corpsey, and pressed powder, to tone down the high-beam glare off my nose. Mascara, eyeliner, and a few pretty-neutral colors of eyeshadow to complement whatever I'm wearing. A lighter "daytime" lipstick and a darker "evening" lipstick, and lip liner, because lipstick doesn't hold up without it. About a hundred chapsticks, because I'm always losing the one that's supposed to be in my purse, and then my lips get chapped while I'm out and I buy another even though I know I have a bunch at home. Oh, and a facial moisturizer, which is different from the one I use on other body parts because the skin on my face just reacts completely differently, and makeup remover, because soap fucks up my skin even more. Those last few might not count, but I do keep them in my makeup bag, along with dental floss and tweezers.   I'd  love  to not feel required to buy all that stuff, but until we as a society get past the notions that a dressed-up woman should be wearing lipstick/mascara and that bad skin indicates poor hygiene and not just genetics, there's huge social pressure practically equating to a mandate to do so.   (And this is already quite long but I'm also going to add: but I've always seen nail polish as more akin to jewelry, an accessory that can be whimsical or expressive even in situations where your clothing can't be. Is the variety or costliness less daunting if you think of it as compared to jewelry?)
Hello ladies (and lurking gents),   I got a BFP today! Some of you may recall my story, but I was pregnant back in 2015 and experienced a MMC at the beginning of August, around 12 weeks for me but they guessed that the baby died around 9 weeks.   We were wrecked for a long time but after a few months of grieving, the husbeast and I decided to try again. We wanted to be casual about it, and I wasn't allowed to temp or obsessively check my app. We BD'ed a few times around the suggested ovulation week but we weren't being really scientific about it.   This week my boobs have been swollen and super sore, my energy has plummeted and I've been getting the black hole hangry food cravings. I just inhale food, it's crazy. I had chalked it up to starting a new job this week that's really physical and that my PCOS was acting up again.  But we did it! We're scared and excited all at once. Please send happy thoughts of sticky baby dust!!!!
Human beings are wired (as in, there is an instinctual, non-conscious response) to respond to physical contact.   Extreme case point:  many autistic children respond positively to being 'compressed' (eg, schools will have heavy, lead-lined blankets like those used for X-ray shielding).  This is related to the same pathway.   Neuroscience brain studies have shown that physical contact with other human beings releases increased amounts of neurotransmitters associated with pleasure.
Hey there, first time poster on this subreddit, I moved about 5 years ago California to work in a family business of a not-that-close relative, before coming here, everyone told me that it is HELL to work in a family business because other coworkers will always look at you very bad and think that you are here to f ck everyone up and that the relative that hired you will always expect more from you than what you can deliver. Every single day, when the boss (my relative) is not in the office, about 15 employees email him with complaints about the most stupid thing they can think about without knowing what I am doing. Examples of complaints include:  using a coworkers computer (when she was having issues with the network uploading files) part of my job is doing IT and I fixed it; other example includes: dropping off the office mail after 5:00 (I can drop it off before 5:30 and the post office is not even 3 blocks away from where I work) and the coworkers want me to drop them off like at 4:30, yet I get in trouble if I leave earlier to drop off the mail and I get in trouble if I drop the mail after 5. Texting on my cell phone (when I am replying an active clients text). I know it sounds stupid, but this has been going on for over 4 years and honestly I feel like shit. Oh, and btw, I get paid minimum wage with bonuses since I started, never have had a raise and when I asked my relative for a raise (he is making about $500k) he told me that there is not too much money in the payroll for a pay increase, yet other coworkers that are not relatives get a pay raise even TWICE a year. Living in California (L.A.) is not cheap, and I used to be a Uber driver on the side just to compensate the money that I needed to survive here in CA. Well, the Uber gig was great, until they cut the prices way down, to the point that if I would have kept driving, I would have been making Uber money while I was losing money. All the money that I saved from Uber has been burning slowly it since September 2014 since I don't make enough to survive here in the office. I am one of those that dropped out of college and don't have any other place to go. My parents look at me like a disappointment or the black sheep, I have siblings and all of them went to college and graduated with honor roll and are working professional jobs making over $120k. I am 27 and my W2 with bonuses came to a total of almost $28k.  I have a car that depreciated enormously since I was doing Uber, yet I still owe over 7 grand on that car. I will be homeless in about 3 weeks with no where to go and pretty much $1000 (the final check + vacation time) and that will be used to pay off my credit cards. I can probably put a coworker here in the office as a reference for a new job, but I read somewhere that it triggers a red flag if it's not a supervisor, and my supervisor won't say anything good about me, even though the employee handbook says that the only thing that they would say in a reference is start date and end date + last job title I am sure that she will add something extra to make sure the potential employer doesn't hire me (has already happened on 2 different offers that I had for seasonal jobs). In other words I am really f cked. I know that this is not the worst thing to happen to someone and I know that others have major issues to deal with and I totally understand that, but I really don't know what to do, and I feel like shit, like a loser that tried to be successful and failed, over and over again. I read John Paul DeJoria's background and I really admire him, but I have no idea how he became who he is now, and I really want to be something in my life, not live in depression as I have been living for the past 10 years.
I wasn't necessarily a "Popular Kid" in my high school, but I was friends with a few kids who would be considered that.  In there group there was a girl that was exactly like the one you describe, and most people just didn't give a shit, but at the same time didn't take any shit from her, and that seemed to work out pretty ok.  I personally ignored her unless I absolutely had to acknowledge her, and that worked out fine for me.
First post.  My wife and I have both worked retail off and on over the past [REDACTED] years.  Some of these are my wife's tales, some are mine.   This nugget was from my wife.  She worked at a large retail chain for several years.  This particular location was closing, as they were moving into THE MALL.  This meant they were going to sell as much as they could as opposed to moving it to the new location.  As you could imagine, high priced women's clothes going for 60-75% of their value generated a lot of traffic.  So much so, in fact, every couple of hours, they would have to rope off the changing rooms to clean out the stuff people didn't want, and return it to the floor.   On one particular sweep, my wife picked up a pile of $100+ blouses COVERED IN PISS.  That's right, thousands of dollars of literally pissed away.   Despite how crushed they were by people, after that, there was someone on point at every dressing room to check after a customer left to insure that didn't happen again.   It still happened.   Another event, same sale, was a man that insisted that every garment being purchased was rung up separately, in case he needed to return something.  Despite explaining that he could return any item at any time, as long as he had the receipt, he insisted it be done this way.  Making a long line even longer.   EDIT:
A long time ago, maybe three years ago, I dated this girl from across the country. Let's call her M. We met on MapleStory, of all places. Anyway, we got along great, had tons of things in common. It was awesome. Back then, things were rough because of an emotionally abusive boyfriend she had. He'd keep coming back into her life, she'd feel guilty for leaving him, and end up leaving me in turn. It was kind of a rubber-banding thing where she'd keep snapping back and forth. It hurt me, but I truly cared about her, and worried about her. I wanted to be there for her. When we talked, she smiled, she laughed, she broke out of her shy shell. Made goofy faces. Cracked jokes.   It got to the point where she was fairly abusive to me. She'd say terrible things about how she was using me, and never truly loved me. How the whole thing was an act. I'm almost positive that's a lie to try to break things off with me without me clinging to her. Because she kept coming back, apologizing, spending time with me, etc, whenever things got hard. I could tell she enjoyed my company and wanted me around, but was having a hard time accepting that fact. She had a pretty rough childhood that would leave anyone emotionally scarred. Having gone through some tough times myself, I could relate. I felt for her. But it kept getting worse. Eventually, I just stopped letting her come back.   A year or so passed. She comes back into my life. For the sake of saving time/space, I'll just say the same thing happened a few times over the next few years. She'd come back, we'd have an awesome time together, and after a few days/weeks, she'd say she was using me, she can't talk to me, and delete/block me from everything. But each time, she seemed more... Genuine? Like. She opened up to me more.   Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Overwatch came out and she started messaging me again. In the time since I last spoke to her, I've changed a lot. I've been going through living in poverty, no hot water for years, hardly able to get a meal. So relationships are something I've been sort of... Numb to? I guess? Anyway. I've matured. I've grown stronger as a person. So I figure, what's the harm? I'll talk to her again. She also got Overwatch, and we played a bit. Had a lot of fun. Business as usual, you're probably thinking. Haha, in retrospect I guess so. We talked, stayed up into the wee hours of the night, talking nonstop. Watching anime together. It was great! She opened up to me, told me she was moving soon, told me how she still wanted to meet me someday. But the difference this time was we agreed to keep it as friends.   Well... That didn't last too long. One night, things sort of escalated on Skype. The following night, we were just sort of casually talking about our future. Not even in like an ooey-gooey lovey-dovey sort of way. Just kind of matter-of-factly. It was strange... I've never actually talked to someone like that. So. We started dating for what must have been my shortest relationship ever.   The following day, we talked. M was packing for her move so she didn't have much time, but she did check in to tell me she was grateful I was supporting her despite all the shit she's put me through. She vented about how she didn't want to leave her dogs behind, and how hard it would be to move away from her friends and live alone. Told me that she was happy I'd be there to keep her mood positive in this new life she was about to start. She was a lot more open with me... A lot more grateful for me. It was nice. She'd never been like this in the past.   Sure enough. This morning I wake up, and she messages me.   >[10:51:49 AM] m: i lied to you and used you. i should not have said yes to dating you.  [10:52:02 AM] me: How so?  [10:53:17 AM] m: i had a boyfriend. i did not like how my relationship was going. i cheated on him with you. i faked intimacy with you.  [10:53:44 AM] me: I wouldn't exactly call it fake. We can always talk about this at a later date, though. I still love you, and I'll still support you / watch anime with you / play games with you, okay? :)  [10:54:48 AM] m: i cannot talk to you anymore. it isn't right. i'm sorry for doing this to you again. i truly hope you can find happiness.   And that was it. She deleted me. I followed up with some messages, saying that I don't care about that and I just want to talk it out. That she can't keep running away like this. That I still want to be there as a friend to her. I thought she changed. She  has  changed... But some things just don't change, huh?   Look. I'm not stupid. I realize it's dumb of me to pursue this. I realize what a toxic situation it is. I know I shouldn't trust her. You can tell me all day that it's a bad idea and that she's no good for me. I learned that a long time ago. But I truly feel unphased by this.   I want to talk this out with her. I want to make sure she's okay. She says she's using me and yet she was  happy  talking to me. I do care about her. I know she's hurting a lot, and I can't just abandon her. Because I do love her, despite all this. I've been with many people that I cared about, but M's the only person I'd go through this much shit for. I'm not hurt or angry. Just concerned about her. I don't care if she has a boyfriend, I'll support her as a friend. I just wish she'd be more honest. I just wish she would stop running away. If you're going to open up to me about your concerns, don't run away when something like this comes up. Stay and talk. And if you're reading this, M, please understand this. I'm not mad at you. I don't hate you. I want to be there for you. You can't hurt me anymore. I'm stronger than you think. But if problems arise, just  talk to me about it  instead of shoving me away.
Your active participation in this thread shows that you do give a fuck, if only a small one.  If you really didn't care you wouldn't defend yourself.   I'm not going to say don't do it or be a cheery gladbag and throw platitudes at you.  What you do with your life is your choice.  I can't take the proverbial gun out of your hand.   I will say that professional treatment can take a lot of time and a lot of times you have to try different methods or medications before you start getting better.  I was lucky enough to find a treatment plan that worked well for me early on.  A friend of mine who is not so fortunate has tried to commit suicide four times in the past few years.  The first year or so she was in and out of the hospital.  She's been on multiple medications and most recently has been undergoing periodic ECT sessions.  She is finally starting to turn around.  If you went to a therapist for a few weeks and tried one or two antidepressants you can't say you "tried that too".  But seeking and sticking with treatment is your choice to make.  If you don't want it treatment won't work for you.   I'm sorry about your family.  I'm not just saying that.  My best friend is a transman and he struggles with depression as well.  It's no secret that LGBT people are more likely to commit suicide.  I hope your family comes around.  Even if they don't, I hope you find people who help you realize your self worth.  There is nothing wrong with you.  The problem lies with them.   I'm rambling - if you've read this far I'm glad that you did.  I'll spare you the armchair psychology that gets flung around Reddit.  Most people here have never been truly depressed.  If someone's never had the horrible weight of depression dragging at them day in and day out they can't truly understand it.  It's easy for them to say "just try" because they don't get how hard it is to try and worse to try and to fail.  I just want to say that I hope you find what works for you.  I hope you find the strength to try again and find what balances you out or at least gets you on a higher baseline.
I used to work with a fat, ugly, smelly, borderline homeless kid (unpaid intern sleeping at a flophouse in NYC). He hooted and hollered at girls on the street all day every day (we used to make deliveries together). He got about 3-5 numbers a day, usually. He dated many of these girls. That's when I learned the reason people do this: believe it or not, it works.
Well there is certainly a balance, and this is going to be more of a general statement than anything. In the working world there may not be enough time or resources to see what someone is going to do with their freedom, but at the same time micromanaging takes resources as well. It's a balance, and it's up to a good leader to find that balance.   OP's problem is likely that this person is fairly new and needs experience. Training her to work efficiently is probably the best bet.
to be honest, this is what is so good amount this game. you actuslly have to make effort to find the items you need, and self found items have a lot more value. ive been looking for a 4L high hp helm for 3 days now. its frustrating, but rewarding.   if they added something like an AH a massive social side of the game would be removed.
Before you read this sorry for the random info thrown around this is how my brain works not entirely linear, just kind of random   So I have seen many theories in which the Others are a weapon made by the children of the forest to attack the first men. I have some issues with that 1) Are the children so powerful they can create a new life form? And 2) a quote from the asoiaf wiki   “Eventually the First Men and the children fought one another to a standstill. The two races agreed to peaceful coexistence and signed the Pact on the Isle of Faces, granting the open lands to humanity and the forests to the children.   The Pact lasted for 4,000 years before the enigmatic Others invaded from the uttermost north, bringing death and destruction to both races, during an extended period of winter known as the Long Night. The children of the forest joined with the First Men, lead by the last hero, to fight against the Others in the Battle for the Dawn. Eventually the Others were driven back into the Lands of Always Winter.”   So they had a pact that lasted 4,000 years in peace and then they decided to make a weapon?   Also about the children we get “The children did not use metal, weave cloth or build cities; instead they lived off the land, using stone implements, wearing bark leg-bindings and shirts of woven leaves, dwelling in caves, crannogs, and hidden tree villages. Males and females both hunted side by side. The children had no books, no ink, no parchment and no written language.[2] They were a people with a deep connection to the land.[3] The children wielded obsidian weapons and bows in battle, but also used powerful magic.”   Why would the children have used obsidian weapons when stone is probably easier to come by and shape, note that’s what ancient people in our world used, I’m thinking that the others have always been around and the children had already had confrontations with them prior to the long night, but due to the no written langue issue they became a legend, much like they are in westeros today.   A quick side note why is the fist of the first men so far north when they entered from dorne? Never understood that….   “The first members of the Night's Watch drove the Others back in the Battle for the Dawn.[3] Other legends state a great hero, who in the eastern tradition is known as Azor Ahai, led the war against the Others wielding his sword of fire, Lightbringer, driving the Others back. In the Westerosi tradition, he may be known as the last hero.” So in this passage we learn some stuff, such as the Nights watch started prior to the wall’s creation, that AA is possibly the last hero who is possibly tptwp (no surprise always thought they were the same), and chances are if AA was there then lightbringer isn’t a dragon or the wall seeing as how neither is in westeros yet.   “Steps were taken to ensure that the people would never be caught offguard by an invasion from the North again. Bran the Builder supposedly raised the Wall, an imposing structure of solid ice and magic, stretching one hundred leagues from the Gorge in the west to the Shivering Sea in the east, cutting off the Lands of Always Winter from the remainder of Westeros.” I love this passage because of the word supposedly, I do like the theory that the others made the wall, I mean a big block of ice to stop those that control ice… and we do get this from grrm him self when asked what their swords are “Ice. But not like regular old ice. The Others can do things with ice that we can't imagine and make substances of it.”   “. Eventually they were defeated, supposedly by the Night's Watch in the Battle for the Dawn, and the Wall may have been raised as a defense against them” another quote about how the wall may or may not have been made to stop them. I’m liking the whole border idea instead, the others get the lands to the north and the humans get the land to the south.   So we did find out that the others use human babies to make more others, or at least that’s the common interpretation of that scene on tv. Warning tinfoil needed (What if the wildlings where part of the arrangement, we leave some criminals in your territory so that your race lives on and you all leave us alone, the nights watch is trying to keep the wildlings north of the wall at any rate.)   So then who was the first other, if they reproduce through humans then how did they start in the first place…   In the nights king wiki page we get “Later, he fell in love with a woman "with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars". He chased her and loved her though "her skin was cold as ice", and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.[1] Her description matches that of the Others” This is the first and only time we see a female other. Combine this with “Old Nan used to say that there were wildlings that would lay with the Others to birth half-human children.” Alright for this next part don your tinfoil armor.   The two above ideas that a) the nights king was in love with the only female other we know of and b)stories of wildlings laying with others to make half-human children followed by c) the show showing the “nights king” turning a baby into an other leads me to think that   1) The “nights king” shown in the tv show was in fact the half-human child of the first nights king, he would have extended life due to his mom’s side, and a “kings” son eventually becomes king, so that could be why they called him the nights king. 2) This one is vague but there are no more female others, this is why they are stealing the babies to further their race.   Now the reason no more females is important is because I think that the others aren’t the bad guys in all this, in fact the cotf are. I’m thinking that the cotf lived in the south originally (mainly due to the fact their race doesn’t seem like the kind to endure the long cold winters of the north) and the others lived n the north. Since we saw that the others bring the cold with them im thinking the entire north use to be like the land of always winter and some of that lingering magic is why it snow even in the summer (just speculation and doesn’t really matter)   Now I think at some point the children learned obsidian could easily kill the others, (look how easily Sam killed the other) and decided to expand their territory, and eventually drove the others to the lands of always winter (killing a lot of their women), because the others live so long I think they reproduce slowly otherwise they would overrun the world. So they escaped to the lands of always winter just to save their race and by time.   Then the first men showed up later and started killing the cotf severely reducing their numbers, and then they made the pact. The pact lasted 4,000 years which to a race that lives for an indefinite amount of time (the others, ice preserves) isn’t that long, but long enough to try and rebuild an army to take back what was stolen. So the others saw that the cotf were dramatically reduced in population and attacked to retake their homelands. When the first men and cotf were about to beat them they raised the wall in hopes to keep more land from being taken from them.   The nights king had a kid with the queen of the others (the last female other? Make sense that they would keep the queen safe, maybe she came south to make a plea for her people and fell in love) And she died in child birth, now the others are being led by their kid who wants revenge for their people.   The last thousand years or so he has been gathering wildling babies to create these half-human beings (not as powerful as a full other but much more abundant) to take back their land.   Now I think the cotf are helping Bran to finish the genocide they started against the others. This fits with the others being misunderstood that GRRM said.
At school one day there was an announcement that there had been rumours of someone in my year carrying a weapon around school and therefore everyone's locker and bags were going to be searched.   I had a master key for everyone's locker in the school (somehow obtained by my older brother when he was at the school) but I had only used it to help people and never got anyone into trouble using it.   I had some less then legal plants in a glass jar in my locker and was deciding what to do with it. As everyone was going through their lockers before the search was going to happen (IMO kind of defeated the point of the search), I saw a boy in my year who had previously got me and some of my friends in trouble.   30 seconds after he finished at his locker, I opened his, placed the glass jar in and closed the locker door. I was slightly annoyed because I had lots a fair amount of plants and a good glass jar.   Anyway, a week later he gets expelled and me and my friends all smoke some substances in celebration of it.
Can I be honest? Yes.   I didn't always used to be though. I went to a small high school, same kids K-12. Thing was I only really connected with a few kids those 14 years (I went to Pre-1st). And those three guys moved away all by the end of middle school. Everyone knows high school can be brutal unless you got your friend group set for the entirety of high school. I wasn't in one, and always seemed to bounce around with making any true friends.   But that was fine for me; I was waiting for something else. I didn't know what exactly, but I know it had something to do with university and girls (THE One? idk, maybe it was teenage dreaming).   I used my frustration to become a better person though. I took 8 or 9 APs in high school cause I was bored. I casually picked up Latin using  this . I started to pick up Rowing as a sport for fun. I took an incredible interest in  movies  I decided to double major in a related field (biochemistry with bioengineering) because I thought I could use the challenge and the extra knowledge. Because I thought I was a bit bored I decided to start doing undergraduate research in biomaterials because I thought it would make me a better student and researcher. Because I thought it was fun I decided to take up sailing at my school, and now I'm on the club team!   Got lots of friends now, an amazing social life, doing great academically this semester, AND I have my 21st birthday on Wednesday (the 24th of October). I feel like I molded myself into the man I want to be from the average teenager I was. Also have a very supportive family.
your point 3 ->   Where do you get this idea. Have you ever heard of [goldie blox](   This is a company started by people in engineering/cs fields who wanted to change how we raise   our daughters. We don't necesarily want to turn them into boys as there are many things we do   wrong with how we raise them as well. But we do want to change how society encourages boys in   mat and science and engineering but doesn't encourage girls. And its true that society doesn't.   There aren't many toys made for girls that encourage inventiveness and puzzle solving. Legos   and blocks tend to be marketed towards boys. Video games are as well. Goldie Blox is a company   that decided a good way to encourage girls is to make a toy marketed for them that is   inventive.   I was at an event for diversity put on by my school's AWC. One girl, a senior in the cs     department, told us a story of when she was a kid and changed schools, they made her be in Home   ec and would not let her transfer to engineering. Recently my school's AWC did a focus group   for woman. Their goal was to get at least 14 of us but the guy that is the teacher supervisor   for the club said he had ran out of names quickly. Only 9 people showed up. One of the things   that came up in that focus group was why we thought there weren't many girls in the department.   And the answer agreed upon by everyone was that we weren't encouraged to do this when we were   younger. Not one of us had started doing anything cs related until college or late high school.   And only one of us said they played with boy marketed toys (me) when we were younger. I was the   only one who played with legos and blocks and video games. And I still didn't get into CS until   my junior year of high school. My guy friends would be goofing around in flash and I emulated   that a little but if I hadn't been able to take a computer web programming class at technical   skills center run by the public school districts in my area, I would never have thought to   pursue it as a major. And Many girls don't get that chance.   your point 2 ->   It's hard to get into a subject if 1) None of your friends are into it and 2)You don't see any   other girls and no one you can relate to. NOw I always had mostly guy friends. It's just how it   worked out. But many girls are only going to be comfortable beginning something if there are   others they relate to that they can get help from. One of the things brought up in the focus   group was that the boys in the department tend to be really competitive and don't want to help   others. Now, the majority of the boys in the junior and senior level of the department (and   probably much of the sophmore entry levels) have been doing CS since they were very young. They   were encouraged and had many people they could relate to already doing it. They probably know   much of their class's material before they begin and can do the projects fairly easily. The   girls (at least the one's in the focus group) did not have that head start. So we are all   struggling to keep up and learn all the background while the teachers ( majority male) teach as   if they expect everyone to be at the boys' level. If we try to ask the boy's for help they   won't give it to us and think were stupid. Many of the teachers act like this as well. There   are certain teachers the girls won't go near to ask for help due to this intimidation. And some   just don't bother event trying to see how a certain teacher will be due to past experience.   There were mulltiple girls in that group who had heard teachers ask them why they were even in   the department if they couldn't do something.
I've been searching the Internets for a while now and always seem to come up short of what I'm looking for. A friend of mine is starting a Pink Floyd tribute band and I'd love to play a few songs with the band. Off the top of my head, The Wall is really the only album with enough orchestral parts to make it worth my while to buy some sheet music. I've searched high and low, and the closest I've come are a few songs here and there that have vocals and guitar, and I try to read the songs as best I can from those. Problem is, then I'm playing the guitar parts on a violin, and I really want to play the actual violin parts. Any pointers on where I can find the orchestral sheet music? Does it even exist? Any help you could give me would be very much appreciated.   I should also mention that I'm picking my violin back up after a roughly 8 year hiatus, and at the moment playing/learning The Wall by ear is pretty much out of the question.
This is a joke. The only thing that reddit cares about in its daily circle jerk is the plight of the white man. Just like the only sexism they care about are conjured up "Men's rights" scenarios, the only racism that they ever care about is conjured up "reverse discrimination".   Because talking about real sexism and racism is so cliché and racist since talking about racial injustices only takes you in a direction away from a post racial MRA dominated feminist utopia where such conversation would never happen, the so edgy teenagers and the libertarian man children of reddit are brave enough to speak up for America's most ignored and unmention and wronged racial class, the white male.
Nothing, but I know it wasn't part of our universe because our universe didn't exist yet.   So you're making assumptions about the nature of reality and the origins of our universe that aren't based on anything testable or verifiable. Just like ancestral spirit worship.   >Thank you, I will watch this when I have a bit of time.  However,  would you mind
Hello all,   I love reddit. It's a great and fun way to lose time. It's also, I learned, a great way to get a glimpse of other people's lives, their feelings, their characters. And it's a fantastic medium for sharing emotions. So that's why I decided to write this little post. Not for karma whoring, but since I'm really a bit lost. And so is my wife.   The story: we got together a couple of years ago. Big love. Really. And still. She has two fantastic children from her first marriage. They love me, and I love them. Really very much. I didn't want children of my own, things were great the way they were. But gradually, those feelings changed. And so did hers. We wanted a love-baby. And since the kids are growing up really fast, and starting to hit puberty in an adorable way (I know this will change. I remember my own puberty. But at this moment, their adorably grumpy.) we decided to really go for it. Mind you, my girlfriend is 39 (I'm 32) and has lost one ovary after the birth of the youngest. So chances were still pretty good, but overall not as good as they were ten years ago. So we expected difficulties.   After six months of trying, in April, the test came out positive. We were going to be parents again. We couldn't be happier. We waited some weeks and informed my parents, her parents, the godmother en -father. And gradually, all of our friends.   This was a week ago. On wednesday, we miscarriaged. I was in Cannes for the Cannes Lions festival, and she had joined me for a couple of days. Our goodbyes in Cannes were heartbreaking, but in a good way: this is true love and the baby was going to make everything perfect.   RIght after she landed, she started bleeding severely. In the airport, she left her luggage with a police officer and headed for the toilet. This wasn't looking good. She tried to reach me. I was in a meeting so couldn't answer. I did call her immediately afterwards, but she didn't pick up. So I called my dad who was going to pick her up from the airport. He answered and told me she was at the gynaecologists office. My colleague who was with me at the time, saw my face went pale and asked if everything was ok. She then told me it could be everything. Maybe she went for a checkup.  I felt my stomach turning. This was not a checkup. And then the phone call.   I will never remember the phone call. It was her. I was standing on the Croisette in Cannes. Everything looked amazing. The sea, the skies, the people having fun. But everything froze when I heard her voice full of tears. I didn't understand a word she was saying, but I knew we had lost our baby.   My mind went blank.   Instantly I knew I was leaving cannes. I called my colleagues, called the airline, booked a new flight and became a mess. I cried all afternoon, waiting in my hotel room for the taxi to arrive. Everyone was sweet to me. They didn't know what had happened, but I must have looked awful.   In the airport, I think I must have looked liked a drugged up weirdo. I got very strange looks. Maybe people thought I was going to do something horrible to their plane. I don't know. Everything became quite blurry after the phone call.   Yesterday, my wife had surgery and the baby is gone. And now, all we do is cry, pick ourselves up, and cry again.   I know this happens all the time, and that this is not a big disaster, and that we will get over it, but I also know that sharing something can help the process. Speed it up, maybe. So that's why I'm posting this.   I need real life stories from people so that I can tell my wife things are going to be ok. They're everywhere on the internet, I know, but many of those stories were written years ago.   So are there people going through the same things now? How are you coping with the loss?  I'm usually the sort of guy who fixes everyting (as men tend to do), but now I'm completely lost and I have an empty feeling in my stomach. I don't know what to do, and I think we could need a little but of help.   Thank you very much, and to everyone going to the same thing: we should help each other, and you have our deepest sympathy and love.
My only point against Cleveland was having to watch the Browns on TV. I've never called out Cleveland as being a bad town. I've driven through it a couple times and it really seemed like a decent town.
Met her at a party. When I saw her I knew she was exactly who I wanted to talk to.. I got the balls to walk up to her and we talked for a bit. Headed to the bar for a drink and saw her slip and bust her ass. I ran over and picked her up.. We didn't let go of each others hands all night after that.. I didn't want to let go of her hand and from what I can tell she didn't want to let go of mine. (Never felt that before) We talked all night and eventually made plans to see each-other again.   From that moment on we saw each-other twice a week for about 7 straight weeks.. We slept together on the 6th meet. It was just passionate and real.   Then the boom. Next time I see her she says she's never been in a real relationship and feels unsure...(apparently this was her way of asking for space). My insecurities kicked in and instead of backing off I chased like a fool and it only pushed her away to the point of her cutting off all contact. Granted I did not blow up her phone or anything but every person has their boundaries and I wasn't aware of hers.   She sent me an email saying it was best we didn't talk anymore and she's no longer interested in continuing to see me. No real explanation but I guess she didn't owe me one. I emailed her apologizing for not giving her space and wished her the best. She replied back a week later wishing me the best too.   So yea... That's it. It's over. Ive tried every which possible way to get this out of my head. I know the mistakes I made.. I just miss the shit out of her and keep wondering if I'll ever hear from her again. My gut feeling tells me I'll hear from her again someday... But I wish I didn't feel that way.   I've been dumped and I've been the dumper, but something about the way this ended just feels so wrong.  I'm 30. I need to get it together. Anyway.. I came here to get this off my chest. Thanks to whoever took the time to read this mess.
I think PYOTFB's just hosting a 25 instead of doing H LK 10 so I'm down for 11/12 HM 10 with reddit. I'm down for H LK 10 too if we have a good group. Willing to lead it or just explain stuff in vent, I'm psure I'm the only one who's downed it. Not too different from NM tbqh, the challenge was always DPS (healers having to DPS, etc) but after 4.0.1 that should be a nonissue.
So I was 6 when my parents divorce in 2002 but turns out my mom had been cheating on my dad since 1997 and got pregnant 2 times with her secret friend (1st stillborn, 2nd abortion) who is my fathers childhood friend who introduced him to my mom. She accused my dad of forcing her to get an abortion and turned all of his friends against him, even when my brother died from her lack of care (he was handicapped)a few months later she pinned it on him. My dad's the most innocent sweetest father there is and he's my hero but I only started to live with him until I was 12 because she convinced the judge when they were getting divorce that he beat me and beat her (while she was the one psychologically harassing him). She spent 4 years in court and nearly bankrupted my dad voluntarily who has way less money than her.
My grandparents live in Chicago near Midway Airport, and when I was about 4 I was over there for the day with my cousin. We were playing on the swings outside for a while, then my cousin went inside the house for whatever reason. I stayed outside and swung.   Remember how I mentioned my grandparents live by Midway Airport? Well, because I was the only one outside, I'm the only one who can vouch for this story. I shit you not, AN AIRPLANE-AN AIRLINER-flew directly over the house; like, you could throw a baseball in the air and hit the damn thing. I ran in the house screaming and saying the plane almost killed me, but my relatives just laughed at me.
Hello Lovelies.   Some of you may know me, and most of you do not. I made this account because I didn't want people to trace down my main one.   As for the name. I didn't think I was gonna use it so much, so I guess it stuck ahah   You can just call me Temp or Tempo (like those horrible tempo runs ahah).   Mmh, I guess I wanted to make my official way into this lovely community c:   We all know why we are here, but I don't mind answering some questions you may have, if at all.
I'll try to keep this as short as possible.  We started dating when we were both 20 in college.  After graduating we both got jobs in separate towns and lived about an hour apart.  We still were able to make time for each other on weekends, and things seemed ok.  2 years ago she took a job closer to where I live and shortly thereafter moved in with me.  The first year was great, and eventually led to me proposing to her.   Thankfully we have not yet made any wedding plans because the girl who moved in with me 2 years ago is nowhere near the same person that lives with me today.  She used to be fun, active, hardworking, smart.  Since becoming engaged she quit her job and its like her brain has gone to mush.  Its like she said "I've reached my goal of latching onto a man who can support me, and now I'm going to be a lazy slob the rest of my life".  Sex which used to happen almost daily is now maybe once every 3-4 weeks if I'm lucky.  I know we're both never going to be as attractive as we were when we were at 21-22, but frankly shes put on a lot of weight and her appearance has really gone to shit recently.  Any half intelligent conversation I try to have with her feels like explaining rocket science to one of the Kardashian sisters.   Its frustrating working 60-70 hours every week, paying all of the bills, doing all of the cooking, cleaning, and coming home to someone who has been sitting on their ass watching The View and eating Oreo's all day.   She knows I make enough money to support us both, so figures she doesn't have to do a thing anymore.  I've tried to figure out what the hell went wrong with her, but its like she doesn't even care.  Any attempt to ask her why shes not looking for a new job or why she hasn't moved from the goddamn couch all day instantly leads to a fight.  Its shocking how quickly someone can change.   I'm at the point where I'm ready to tell her that it would probably be best for us both to move on.   I'm ready to meet someone new.   I'm afraid of kicking her out because she has no job and nowhere to go.
Nice to see a list; I, like many, was confused as to the goals and desires of the protests. On the specific points:   > 1. Campaign Finance Reform > All votes are no longer equal in our Democracy.   How do you mean? Candidates still require a majority of votes in order to win a seat, and votes are not counted in dollars. There is obviously lots of "lobbying" (bribing) going on, but as far as any actual votes by citizens go, it is still "one citizen, one vote."   > Money must be put outside of politics, or politicians will continue to pander to those who contribute the most to their campaigns, rather than their own constituencies.   Read up on your history. Never going to happen. Patronage, whether to "special interests" or to the larger constituencies, has been a constant of democracies and republics (and pretty much every other form of government) since their inception. Even if you completely eradicate the institutions of money, voluntary provisioning of goods, and wealth inequality, people will always try to advance themselves by currying favor with the powerful.   At best, we can hope for and try to evolve towards a system in which there is a minimum of value transferred for non-productive actions, such as lobbying.   > Specifically, we abhor the decision by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. FEC. Corporations are NOT people.   I'm no fan of crony capitalism, but Citizens United was a pretty open and shut case, and it would have been crazy for it to have been ruled any other way. First of all, it really had nothing to say about corporate personhood, and specifically did not comment on [corporate donations to politicians/parties](   What Citizens United did was overturn the law that prohibited unions and for-profit and not-for-profit corporations from broadcasting "electioneering communications," defined as "a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that mentioned a candidate within 60 days of a general election or thirty days of a primary" (From Wikipedia). I can't see any way that a law prohibiting a certain kind of communication during a certain time period can in any way be constitutional. "Congress shall make no law [...] abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." There doesn't seem to be a lot of wiggle room there.   Whether or not it might be a good idea to ban that kind of speech is a separate and interesting question, but totally irrelevant to its constitutionality.   > While corporate profits have been skyrocketing and the wealthy have been getting wealthier, the average worker's income has dramatically dropped.   I've seen this thrown around a lot, and without going into it too deeply, I think it confuses money for wealth and draws conclusions based on the former. Rather than looking at "inflation adjusted real income," look instead at how long the median worker needs to work in order to afford a given good or service. In areas like health care and computing, clearly the standard of living has shot through the roof.   Instead of measuring something like "the health care expenditures per person have increased," look at "the number of coronary angioplasties performed per year," which, by the way, is between  650k and one million ; the cost of an angioplasty in 1970 would be infinite, since it didn't exist yet.   Similarly, regardless of what official inflation numbers may say, a poor person with a cell phone, especially if they have a smartphone, is infinitely wealthier in terms of computing and internet connectivity than the wealthiest person in 1970, since none of that existed then.   The point being, the numbers attached to wealth and income are not meaningful; the only thing that's important is people's access to goods and services, which have clearly improved for all Americans over the last half-century.   > It has been shown time and time again that tax cuts for the wealthy are NOT effective.   By what definition of "effective?" For raising revenues for the federal government? For ensuring a lower (measured) inequality between the high and low earners? For promoting a higher level of wealth creation? These are not purely rhetorical questions; if the goal is to raise federal revenues, then we get into a bunch of debates about the Laffer Curve and such. What if "taking less of people's money" is part of the definition of "effective" we are using?   > Taxes on those who practice greed should be raised.   The "greed" one always bugs me. How is "I want to make a better life for myself and my children" greedy? Presumably, that is what most rich people are looking to do, just like everybody else. If you saw a $20 bill lying on the ground, would you pick it up, or would that be "greedily enriching yourself?" When you buy a pack of gum, do you give all of your earthly possessions to the store clerk, or do you "greedily pay her only the minimum you can get away with?" How would one determine what is "greedy" vs. "not greedy?"   > The decision of a judge should not be based upon the race, creed, or wealth of an individual, but rather, the content of the case.   Totally agree. Is this one under unusual attack?   > Those who enter Washington should not be representatives of the elites, but representatives of the people.   I agree with the sentiment, but historical precedent doesn't look good on this front. In Republican Rome, the senators were primarily the landed aristocracy, concerned with extracting wealth and value from the land they owned. Constantly bumping up against their dominion were the representatives of the equestrian class, the merchants, who were enriching themselves and others through trade. The senators were constantly vying for more power for themselves, using any means they could, legal, political, financial, or simply straight-out murder. The few prominent figures who tried to enact redistributive policies, most notably the [Gracchi brothers]( were beaten to death in the Forum.   Obviously, that is an overly-harsh way of disagreeing with a policy proposal which seeks to establish a more progressive welfare state. I'm definitely not advocating Roman-style politics, merely pointing out that expecting corruption to disappear from any form of government is hopelessly naive.   My preferred solution is to have enough organizations competing with each other that none can afford significant wasteful corruption; this involves weakening the extent of the federal (and state) government's monopoly over as many areas of society as practical. If the USPS didn't have a forced monopoly on certain kinds of mail, competition from UPS and FedEx would force out (or at least reduce) the level of corruption that the USPS could get away with and still survive. This is a silly example, because I don't perceive there being much corruption in the USPS, but you get the idea.   Bottom line, I agree there are problems, and I largely agree about which problems are present, but I don't think the solutions, or next-best work-arounds, are likely to be had from our current conception of federalist democracy. Many of the grievances you list disappear when the institution in question no longer has a monopoly on force, such as campaign finance reform. I haven't heard any widespread complaints about the selection process of corporate board members by the stockholders of that corporation. The "revolving door" problem which is so damaging in government simply becomes "getting a different job" when a person changes jobs in the private sector.
I had a coworker (he has since been laid off), but he was always saying he knew everything about dieting and nutrition, but he was 5'10" and 220 lbs.  I'm not even sure if that is obese but he was definitely fat.  Anyway, I got tired of hearing him tell me that the Paleo Diet I was on was complete nonsense and that plant based diets are the way to go along with his intermittent fasting diet (eat one day, don't need the next day)   Finally, I got so fed up with him preaching to me that he knew so much about nutrition I told him to put his money where his mouth was.  I said I'd bet him $500 that he could not get down to his target weight of 165 lbs.  He said he would do it in 3 months tops.  I said I'd give him 6 months, but he would have to weigh in every month for the bet to continue on.   I bought a scale and had it delivered to work and asked him how much he thought he weighed.  He said he couldn't be more than 200 lbs.  He was 220.   A month passed by and he refused to weigh in.  I said if we both give $500 each to a non partial 3rd party, I'll give him another 10 lbs, so he only has to get to 175 lbs (or lose 45 lbs).  He agreed.  I even encouraged him to start exercising and started to get on his case when he would eat a bag of cookies at the office.   Two months left in the bet he said he was going to get serious with this.   He didn't look like he lost any weight at all, maybe 10 lbs at best.  He said he was going to do a 10 day fast, which he ended up only doing for 2.5 days and then gave up.   After he lost the bet, he still kept saying how the plant-based diet was only real healthy way to eat.  Unfortunately he didn't really follow it.
So fun story. My best friend slept with my boyfriend and no one told me for a year and a half. The timeline was something along the lines of, Bf and I get together, a month later he sleeps with girl who happens to be a mutual friend that I trust with my life, about two months later I lose my virginity to this boyfriend who I love with all my heart, a year and a half later through very bad circumstances I find out they slept together because she wanted to see what sex was like since she was planning on being with her girlfriend for the rest of her life. They wrote us a contract and everything to never speak of it again. It was behind a picture above his bed which I slept under. What hurt the most was that he, this girl who is one of my best friends and her girlfriend all lied to me about it for so long, and then, when confronted, my BF and friend tried to lie some more saying they just kissed. I found out from her GF. (Also, I'd like to say I'm no angel here. I cheated on him too right before I found out. With his cousin. Yeah.. Hell, here I come.) My BF and I stayed together for about another 6 months and then we couldn't handle it anymore. We loved each other, but we were coming to a realization that we were not good for each other. The bright side of this story? The friend that had slept with my boyfriend, we're still friends. I forgave her and now several years later she is my best friend. If we can make it through that, we can make it through anything. Honesty really is the way to go here though. Tell your boyfriend what you did. I hurts 1000 times worse to hear it from someone else.
Haha what coincidence! Anyways, just last Wednesday I was biking back to my Universities campus (I commute) and I took a left turn into a two way street that had no stop signs or street lights (like to call them freeway streets because you can go pretty fast). Before turning, I was going donw an inclined street, and I bike like a maniac, so I was going at exactly 19.3 mph. Because I was going so fast, I turned really sharply, ignoring the stop sign, mind you, and winded up on the the opposite side of the street. There was a car coming dead at me. Having time to react, I veered to the right, and before I knew it, I saw headlights coming behind me on my right side. I only had enough time to realize what was about to happen and say "Oh shi-", then BOOM! I was on my ass. If I had ridden my bike responsibly and payed attention to the stop sign, that wouldn't have happened. I'm actually lucky to be alive as the lady did not brake or anything, and I'm pretty sure she was going at around the same speed I was. Even more miraculously, I wasn't seriously injured; some scrapes, bruises, and a ton of stiffness in my back and neck, but no broken bones, or even sprained ones. Unluckily, my bike is now totalled; my tire rims are bent and I'm trying to find a way to fix them.
After finally completing a WoC campaign I thought I'd voice my frustrations with it and see what you guys think.   Disregarding that it was given as a preorder bonus it is a race pack that's £5.99 in the UK which is significantly less than the £13.99 for the Beastmen and for me personally the gap in price was met with a similar gap in quality. I'd happily pay more for race packs so long as they don't end up being as unenjoyable as WoC.   Now I'm gonna try and cover most of the specifics that frustrated me about this campaign. Starting with attacking settlements. The proximity attrition mechanic is clearly there to stop WoC just sticking as one group and crushing everything but I feel an exception should be made whilst besieging/turn after beating settlement. This is especially frustrating when the AI just sticks an army in a settlement and refuses to move. Now the Raze/Loot mechanic is clearly just bad and I'm assuming CA don't wanna copy the Beastmen on this one. It really just doesn't make any sense, I sack a settlement getting favour (so I'm sacrificing everyone in it I'm assuming) yet the settlement is there with just a 1 tier lower main building. Then I have to wait before I can level the city. I'd honestly be quite happy with a straight rip off of the beastmen here.   I'm not sure if there's anything more frustrating than chasing an army around the map imagining the sound of Benny Hill music. The only way to avoid this is using agents to block army which firstly you shouldn't have to do, and secondly they're usually too busy fending off the 7 agents from 5 different factions that have been hounding your army.   Replenishment. Good grief this is a mechanic so terrible that the best thing to do is to just merge and recruit brand new units. If I've managed to turn Kislev into a fully corrupted wasteland I'd expect my Warriors who are powered by Chaos to replenish a bit faster. It makes corruption pretty much pointless unless you wanna cheese the AI that can't handle it.   The Gods of Chaos. Now this one really just annoys me as it would have been such an awesome mechanic. These Dark Gods are supposed to be influencing the world and constantly vying for the upper hand. Yet besides Sarthorael and a pleasure palace (gee thanks for slowing me down Slaanesh) they’re about as real as any of the religions in Medieval TW. If CA really wanted to have a unique mechanic they could've been having you occasionally fighting quest battles against their Champions for buffs. Let's say there's a Khorne sends you to destroy a Slaaneshi warhost and you get melee buffs for however long. I feel like CA could've got really creative with the Chaos Gods but instead they paid them lip serice and I think this is a big part in the dullness of the WoC campaign.   The roster. I'm amazed this has been overlooked so much given the uproar about a jabberwhatever for the beastmen. Ogres, warshrines, skullcrushers, slaughterbrutes, chimeras, hellstriders, vortex beasts, nightmaws. I'll give them a pass on the forge world models which are incredible and whilst I'm not surprised it is unfortunate that it looks like we won't be seeing the incredible models Forge World produce. The Lord choices are annoying.  The lack of a daemon prince (or even better your generic Lord could ascend to daemonhood after maxing out, in keeping with TT, roll 12 on eye of the gods become a daemon with all your equipment) should've seen everyone complaining to CA. No unique laws of magic but that's in keeping with their apparent plan of completely stripping the four Gods out of the game. Now they did give us a 3rd LL but if we're being honest Sigvald is boring. I'm honestly not sure why they bothered to have him in and buck the trend of two LLs.   The campaign feels like the WoC were manufactured  for the horde mechanic and not the other way round. If there was ever a campaign that called for a real story driven campaign with some RPG elements, it's this one. You are the general carrying out the will of the Dark Gods. If you're king of the dwarves you're at the top but with WoC there's a higher power. Off the top of my head this campaign should've been around currying the favour of the four, committing greater and greater atrocities in your pursuit of immortality. I would've loved to see quest battles for the major cities with big payouts instead of them being the same as every other one. I'd rather not have 2 stacks vs Altdorf, or be able to starve it out. I'd want a truly epic battle with big payouts besides just money.   I'm aware a lot of this could change in the second expansion according to the Russian datamine. But this is relying on CA giving a free update to WoC when releasing the WoC. I'd like to think CA would consider a couple of these things when making Chaos Divided. Lord knows I'd love WoC to actually become a good DLC.
Bit of background.   Came out of a 3 year long distance relationship around easter this year. (Mutual break up so no real blow to my confidence) Until recently I've enjoyed the rest of nightlife and uni without any physical relations with girls. I've been lurking on the subreddits for a while and have a pretty well rounded idea of what to do theoretically, but until uni there's not much chance at home to practice (countrylife...).   Any bits of advice that should have more emphasis in my case? Can anyone relate to me and tell me what worked for them?
Any insights as to how to overcome this problem would be appreciated.   Task: I have a site that is basically offering a digital download of some videos. To prevent direct access to the files, they are stored outside the web directory and accessed through a PHP script that first authenticates the user, matches a supplied token to a video file through a db lookup and then returns the file contents.   Solution: First I did this with PHP using fread(). I read in a section of bytes into a buffer in a while loop until the entire file was read and sent. My second attempt was having PHP do the authentication then using passthru() to pass the file off to a cgi script that created a file handler and did the same thing (read some byes and printed).   Problem: Both the PHP method and CGI method worked some of the time. The rest of the time, they cut off mid download (download acts like it completed successfully but the file becomes corrupted). After experiencing this issue with PHP, my thoughts were that GoDaddy (host) was killing the PHP process for taking too long and my solution was to pass it over to CGI. Unfortunately, this did not work.   Additionally, my RAM and I/O continue to be maxed out during a single download. I am wondering if GoDaddy is still killing processes once I hit the max allocated for these resources? Why would reading and outputting file contents store anything in RAM? The only RAM used should be the 1024 bytes I am using as the buffer I would think.. and then each new read should write over the previous.   Specs:  GoDaddy Shared Hosting  RAM - 2GB I/O - 2MB
Computer science teacher. I already knew everything that they taught in the class. So when we were working with Karel J Robot in java I decided instead of making the robot move and collect the peepers or whatever, I made an animation program with the beepers, you could fill in each slide using arrays. Teacher came around to check our programs, everyone in the class did the stupid move Karel 2 spaces and pick up beeper. I was really proud of my program. She came by told me "that wasn't the assignment" and gave me a zero. I started hating computer science, which was my passion before. Eventually after I finished the class I picked it up again and realized why I liked it.
liking star wars seems to be 'geek cred' for most people, which i suppose it was back before it became the mainstream goliath it has become.
Not a restaurant but when I was a teenager I lived in this kind of state run group home for fuck ups.  It was a pretty dismal place in an old dilapidated building in the poorest part of the city and there must have been about 500 of us kids crammed in that place.  6 kids per tiny room.  You could regularly find jizz and dead rats and roachs in the old freight elevator we used to get upstairs.  One of my roommates used to shit on the bed each morning and cover it with news papers.  Needless to say, it wasn't the Ritz   Anyway in the caf, the food was shit.  Every other week was soul food week, which meant gizzards and ox tails and all other shit.  Once I bit into my potato and found bugs in it.  But the worst was this little ice cream machine, you know the kind where you press the level and ice cream comes out?  For some reason the ice cream always tasted like cardboard, but I didn't care because anything for me was better than soul food.   Anyway, once I went to go get my nightly ice cream and on the tip were about 5 curvy, tiny little pubic hairs.  Spooning the ice cream I could find more.  I was really grossed out and I took the ice cream up to one of the cooks, and I was like "what the fuck man, there's pubes in my cream..."  He snatched it from me and was like "that's probably just a brotha's hair!"  I remember thinking, oh shit... maybe he's right... but then I realized wtf does that really make it much better?  Either way there was fucking hair in my ice cream, and a lot of it.  How do you even get pubic hair in ice cream in the first place?
Nix working as a tech.  Not worth the time or money.  Go to a small suburban hospital and contact the manager of the ED directly and have a conversation.  Ask him or her what they think you need to do to upskill to ED level.  It may entail taking regular floor job in order to get your basic acute sick patient skills back up to snuff.  ( I don't know how long it's been since you've graduated or how long you've been at an LTC).  An  ADN is fine but if you've been in LTC for a long time you may want a retraining program for nurses that have been out of hospital care for some time.  The BSN is now the designation of choice but it's expensive if you have other debt or financial obligations and the RN to BSN program is competitive to get into but it would be nice to have.

I have a unique opportunity to set up my entire living room/gaming area as a Destiny stronghold...my very own Tower, if you want. I've seen (and plan to buy) the three Destiny class banners from Bungie. But that's only a start....   A bit of background, I just moved into an apartment after a rough ending to my former living arrangements. I'm lacking furniture of all kinds, and have a decent budget. Most of which I plan to put toward my entertainment center. TV Stand and couch come first. Dining table and everything else is secondary. I'll eat on the couch as long as I have to...I just want somewhere comfy to crash... This is where the reddit community comes in: I'm looking for ideas and/or stuff to buy to hang on walls around my tv, or to place on my desk, or entertainment center. Basically anywhere I can fit Destiny, I want. I'm not very hand made centric and I have NO tools to make anything at the moment. Help Please! I can't stand looking at these blank walls for months!
There is no culture on Earth that does not objectify women. Look at upcoming US movie posters and you'll see hordes of airbrushed women with puffy lips and tight outfits. Do you remember that Russian band TATU that was sold  entirely on the main duo's fake lesbian relationship ?  Watch any commercial from any place and you will see women fetishized, objectified, and disrespected.   This does not make it okay. Many things are not okay:     Why do we need political stratification when we have the means to feed everyone in the world?     Why is the US spending money on overseas military action when the poor live in a cycle of squalor thanks to backwards educational theories?     Why do we kill rats but not cats?     Why are women allowed to complain but men must keep silent?     Why are female bodybuilders paid a fraction of their male counterparts?     Why do we condemn murder when we have the death penalty?     Why are people no longer culpable for their own emotions?     Why are comic books considered a lesser literary form than long-form novels?     Why do people listen to radio pundits but not their friends?     Why do we power our vehicles with a finite resource?     Why is polygamy illegal?     Why is marriage not a secular institution?     Why do we marry?     Why do we insist that non-US citizens have the right to US citizenship?     Why do we have borders?     Why do we allow mothers, looking mainly for welfare benefits, to have children?     Why is dueling illegal?     Why is suicide illegal?     Why do we find notions of honor quaint at best and offensive at worst?     Why is "Jersey Shore" on TV more than Carl Sagan's "The Universe"?       My point is, every culture has positives and drawbacks and, once you start questioning things, you realize how inefficient, arbitrary, and backwards most things are.   >Well, yeah, but do you honestly say "Hm, I guess that's just how they do it" when you hear of something from somewhere else which you find repulsive?   Actually yes, I do. Because   A)I can find fault in literally  everything   B) There are a lot of reasons people do things and actually effecting change usually means not directly challenging something.   For example, this post you are making is not actually changing Japanese culture, it is venting frustration. This train of thought is probably making you internally opposed to Japanese culture which makes you less likely to understand how to change it.   The Japanese, like many people, have a lot of cultural pride. Just like if you tell a friend "hey, you're fat", they will likely get defensive and say "hey fuck you, I like being fat", saying "hey your culture is backwards and offensive"  will likely just get them to dig in their heels.   A better way to approach this would be "hey, I think your body fat percentage might cause you health issues" or "remember that cute dress you used to wear?". In this case, it would be better to make an appeal to the idea of "Yamato Nadeshiko", the traditional Japanese woman who was strong of mind, spirit, and body. But you didn't think to make that appeal, because you assumed Japanese culture was all about kawaii shit and pedophilia.   Most people in Japan don't care about whaling. It's not that profitable and is a hold-over from post-WW2 reconstruction policies. That being said, the actions of the  Sea Shepherd  and her crew have made whaling a matter of national pride and now, people in Japan are actually siding  with  whaling as a symbol of Japanese culture against Western oppression (an issue since WW2).   Whaling is unsustainable and silly.  Whale Wars  is full of morons and assholes. Just because you are trying to do something right, doesn't mean you actually  are  doing something right.
This is an economic concept highly related to something called the [Laffer Curve](  There is still some debate about the validity of the idea.   To look at this scenario let's imagine two hypothetical scenarios first:   In Scenario A, the US lowers its taxes to 0%.  This is obviously at least as low as the rate anywhere else.  Assuming that people will behave in ways that maximize their profits, people will start moving nearly all their money into the US.  After all, it could be subject to taxes and other restrictions overseas.  When this money is spent, it'll be spent largely in the US, stimulating the economy.  Of course, with 0% taxes, the government won't be collecting any revenue, leading to some major problems.   In Scenario B, the tax rate is 100%.  No matter how much money anybody makes, they'll lose it once taxes are due.  As a result, people move their money overseas to avoid losing it all to taxes.  Furthermore, people will not spend as much time being productive.  After all, if nobody gets to keep their money, why bother spending your free time trying to grow a business when you're not going to be richer than a part-time McDonalds cashier?  This results in a smaller economy.   Any scenario between 0% and 100% will give results in between Scenarios A and B, where higher taxes reduce money staying in the economy and lower taxes increase wealth inequality.  Theoretically, there is some ideal amount of taxation that will yield the best economic effect.  The biggest problem with this idea, assuming it's accurate, is that we don't know which amount of taxation is best.
I agree with you completely. Last season I played over 900 games of soloq and could never go higher than gold 3. The thing is I knew I didn't belong in this elo. I always won lane and did well but riot just kept sticking me with sh%tty teammates who fed or trolled all game. After giving up trying to reach plat on that account, I created a new account for season 5 ranked and within 60 games after placing into silver 2 (7 and 3 in placements) I climbed to Plat 3 and am currently still climbing at a high rate although I dont have much time and only play 2-3 games a night now. I believe what you mean about how sometimes an account really can get unlucky and that it's best to sometimes just start a new one. I know people are gonna say that I just got lucky on the new account or something but if I did get lucky and got carried by my teams, how come I still win lane almost every game even with the wrong runes (only have adc and support runes on new acct so far). If i can beat a xerath or lissandra as AD runes morgana or annie or nidalee, im pretty sure I belong in this elo or even higher up.
Yes, I know, side character with like 2 scenes and no dialogue, but I'm not gonna let that stop me #sidecharacterlove (in more ways than one. NeonXReese OTP). Plus she's the star (along with Neon) of that fic I'm currently writing, so there's that. I in fact got the idea while writing a fight scene with her.   My theory is that Reese's Semblance involves manipulation of Gravity. Obviously, that one has the potential to be even more busted than Pyrrha's, so there's some caveats:     Reese simply hasn't trained her Semblance a whole lot, because she only discovered it relatively late, and couldn't be bothered to take that much time away from her skating, so her control is relatively limited.   There's a certain something called the planet of Remnant permanently exerting a rather massive gravity on everything, interfering with Gravity manipulation. Sure there's also (presumably, I don't think we ever actually had word on that) the magnetic field of the planet that could mess with Pyrrha's Polarity, but that is significantly weaker; an iron nail left alone will not spontaneously be attracted to the magnetic north, but it will fall to the ground.     That being said, she does get some use out of her Semblance nonetheless, namely her hoverboard. It's pretty clear it's running on Dust, specifically Gravity Dust (which has been confirmed to canonically exist), and it has a color similar to bits of Reese's protectors. Add to that, that in her battle against Blake she seems to control her board without even touching it, including it practically sticking to the back of her hand for several seconds and following her movements (around the 4:40 mark in the episode), as well as her launching it accurately at Blake from several meters away and it returning to her hand after flying in an arc that couldn't be achieved without some sort of manual control.   Thus we (I) can conclude (wildly guess) that     a) Reese's Semblance is indeed control over gravity, but    b) it's relatively little developed, so she has to use Gravity Dust in her gear to actually harness it,    c) which she does to control her board in combat, and little else.
I had smoked a few times prior to this incident, but nothing major. I was over at a friends house, chillaxing playing some halo, when one of his roommates says "hey *** do you want a grav?" i retorted "i dunno what that is but sure..." so i hit the grav like a champ, get some major coughs at then sit back down to play halo, and all of a sudden i was amazing, im talking no scope headshots left and right. after that game, i stood up and was like, "i gtg, before this really settles in"  Little did i know, that it already had. The drive is typically 20min from his place to mine, but that night it took me 1hr, just because i got lost and was travelling through so many back roads. And during this time all i could think about was how my ears felt like the center of gravity wells and that everything was being sucked into them. Best car ride ever.
My puppy's crate is upstairs.  We got her at 16 weeks, she is now 7 months, she has the occasional unexplained accident (most of them our fault because we didn't catch a cue), but she's pretty much housebroken and has been this way since week 18.   One thing that really helped us was putting her on a schedule even if she didn't need to go out.  At very specific times we go out to do business.  While she had an iron bladder that could hold strong in a crate (1 crate accident ever since we got her), we didn't want her to get her into the habit of peeing in the house because that is really one of the hardest things to break.   We kept her supervised all the time.  100% totally all the time unless she was in her crate.  At 16 weeks, she could in theory hold her bladder for 5 hours, but we took her out every 2-3 hours.  If she did her business, great.  If she didn't, we'd try again in 15 minutes.   Another thing we did was pathing with her.  She spends the most time in our bedroom with us.  Any time we came downstairs within the first few weeks, we'd make a beeline for the front door.  For a couple of weeks, especially if she had been holding her bladder for more than 2-3 hours, I would pick her up and carry her outside to the designated pee spot, then to the designated poop spot.  This subtly trained her that "outside" was the natural progression after "down the stairs" if she needed a potty.  Our pathing for the very first bathroom break of the day, usually around 5am at 16 weeks, was to the backyard (fenced in yard; when we had sunlight before the end of DST we'd make her do her business(es) and play fetch all in one trip).  She actually got the drill down quite quickly - she will run to the BACK door first thing in the morning or before mealtimes and run to/sniff at the FRONT door when she needs to be taken out any other time during the day.  We will still carry her outside after 5 hours once in awhile if we suspect she really has to go since she won't pee in our arms, even if it seems inconvenient or we know she's been able to handle it in the past, just to set her up for success and prevent accidents from occuring.  She developed better tells around 6 months (sniff at mat, whimper) and just this week she's started to put her paws up at the door as a tell.   I don't know how often your dog switches floors, but if you confine him to an area like the main floor for a week, where he's already successful, and change up your strategy to 100% supervised on 2nd floor and basement with the consistent expectation that you are going STRAIGHT to the back door every time you change floors for a "potty assessment", he may learn how to path to the door when he wants out and start to exhibit bigger tells like sniffing around that will help you indicate if he really needs to go.  It doesn't have to be permanent, but maybe at least for a little while til he gets the hang of it and is more steady.  If not, he may get used to hiding his pee and poop from you and sneaking away to do his business as a legitimate way to eliminate.  If our dog raced to a different floor around this age, this would immediately set off warning flags and we'd race down to take her out  just in case .
I live in your fucking home town. Stop coming for vaction and congesting all the fucking traffic in Lanikai. Its already bad from all the tourists, we don't need you to literally STOP TRAFFIC for an hour while you eat your fucking Island Snow and go hiking.   And why are you doing that shit on base?! Its a fucking MILITARY base. Arent you the commander-in-cheif to this same military, the one that protects this country and therefore you? Im 100% sure you wont get assassinated.
19 year old with a machine learning job here, no degree, just finished first year of college. I was lucky and got hired by my friend's dad, and now I'm writing machine learning code, and getting paid to do it.
Went to a concert on Labor Day weekend at an outdoor facility with some friends and ended up running into my younger sister (16). Some guys in between my group of friends and her group of friends started to shove each other and it looked like a fight was about to break out, so I moved to block my sister from the impending fight. Some guy turned around, made eye contact with me, and head butted me in the face. My friends dragged me away before I could retaliate and took me outside the concert to clean up my bloody face. On our way out I was stopped by police officers, or sheriff deputies I'm not sure, and questioned as to what happened. The guy who headbutted me walked out shortly after so I pointed him out to the officers. He was taken away and questioned as well. Soon after being told I would be able to give a statement (which I never did), I was handcuffed and put in the back of a squad car, taken in and processed and officially charged. My Omnibus hearing is in about a week and I'm not sure what I should be expecting.
ASADA are yet to release their conclusions remember, they can still punish the players when they complete their investigation. WADA can then appeal that decision if they dislike the punishment delivered by ASADA.
I've been living with my partner for the past 8 months. We've been together for almost a year, known each other for 2.   We get along fine, not too much fights, we do not get on each others nerves. I enjoy living with her, but I realized i  see her more as a roommate than an actual lover.   However, I feel like i do not love her anymore..I do not see myself with her in the long term, so i figured i owe it to her to end the relationship.   I just don't know how to proceed... we are both students, so moving out is not really an option as we are both on a very tight budget. I don't want to play with her, but if I tell her now before the end of the lease(6 months), I fear that situation will be worse for both of us...   I know this sounds like I'm incredibly selfish, but i don't know what to do...
Alright so i Dm'd a game a couple of years back and my group was going down a set of 15 stairs with water running down them and vines on each sides. Half the group slipped and started rolling down the stairs and got tangled in the vines one of them upside down hanging by the feet another had vines wrap around his arms and they had made a link that the vines were alive and attacking them so the other two made it down the stairs and started attacking the vines to free the two "captive" once freed they all fought the vines for a good 5 minutes until finaly a player asked me if the vines were alive and i just told them that i never sayed they were. EDIT:
So, there I was just sitting on a bench at my local mall minding my own business. Partaking in one of my favorite hobbies of people-watching. about 10 minutes in a black prob 17-20 y/o set down not next to me but within conversational distance. After about 5 more minutes, a few of his friends came and chatted with him about Lebron vs Kobe, shoes, weed, ect ect ( typical black guy conversations ). Not 2 minutes after his friends left, he spoke up and asked me: "Hey man, you wouldn't happen to have change for a $50 would you"? I replied without hesitation: "IDK, let me check".   Now for some background. I usually am pretty quick-minded with situations. I pay attention to my surroundings. I often eves-drop into conversations taking place around me. And usually always keep myself out of precarious situations. BUT NOT TODAY!   I knew I had just cashed my payroll check a few hours ago and kept some cash on me. I knew I had a few $20s but didn't know if I could make the remaining $10. After a quick check in my wallet, I had the money in hand. 2 $20's, a $5, and 5 $1's. We traded bills and immediately I knew the bill wasn't right. The feel was wrong. So instantly placed it up against another bill and it was smaller in dimension. I then checked for the watermarks and there were none to be found. I instantly said to him: "NO, I believe this bill is fake and I want my money back". what took place next was a slow but steady escalation right in the middle of a crowded mall.   He stood up and stated: "Its not fake, I just got it from a store in change and need to break it to pay a friend back." I stood up and blocked his progress of walking away. when we both stood up I realized what I was up against. This kid was a good 6 inches taller than me, easily 50lbs on me and at this point, angry that I had confronted/trapped him.   Now I new that @ this point he was NOT getting out of my presence, NO MATTER WHAT! I also knew that it was his word against mine but that if worse came to worse, that we were or at least should be being recorded via CCTV.   I again stated: "this bill is fake and I want my money back NOW and you can walk away or I am calling security". He then said: "go ahead, you have the bill. Its your word against mine. You think they are going to believe me because I'm black and you're white?" At this point I was getting pissed but had to keep my calmness or shit could get out of hand fast!   Immediately I yelled in a stern voice "SECURITY". We were within Earshot of the guest services booth thankfully and I know at least a half dozen people were watching at this point. He said: "Hey man, I just got that. I didn't know it was fake. Let me go get them." I said, No, its too late. I gave you the chance and you passed". and Yelled "SECURITY" once more.   By this time, he was very nervous and trying numerous times to leave but i had him partially cornered between the bench we where on, a kiosk selling hair supplies, and the wall. I glanced over his shoulder and seen a very large man in a suit walking our way. The gentleman asked: "what seems to be the issue" and the kid tried to split once more and I sternly said: "Do not let him leave!"   by this time a few more "mall cops" arrived and separated us and got both stories. I repeated what had happened while he still attempted to leave again. The man on the suit told him he was being retained and called for local PD. Not a minute later I repeated the incident to the officer. The officer then spoke with the kid. He obtained the bill from me and looked it over and stated it was def a fake. The kid tried to play dumb not knowing about the water marks and such.   The officer didn't buy it, obtained the kids ID, spoke on his radio, then asked me how I would like to proceed. I told him that I gave him the option to get out of it and he passed. I asked the officer if he had the right to search the kid. He said NO. I then stated that he could have more bad bills on him. The officer then went back to the kid and asked for consent to search him. Like a scared kid, he said yes. The officer did a quick scan then took his wallet and sure enough. 4 more FAKE $50's! needless to say, the ball is in my court!   The officer immediately arrested the kid and read him his rights! HE was pissed!! cussing and yelling obscenities at me.   It was at this time that a was flooded with different emotions. Knowing I fucked up by trying to be a good patron. The potential for the situation to end way worse for me. And the overwhelming feeling that I did right by standing my ground and busting this asshole!   I immediately went and got a soda to cure my crazy cotton mouth and left the mall. Now, a few hours later. looking back, The way I handled the situation has given me a great deal of confidence in my ability to handle a situation with a stranger. I do know this feeling could very well one day make things worse for my but for now, I feel great! but I still FUCKED UP!
New user here. How's your BTS going? Between the dreadfully worded ads and families of 7 raising hell because "WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE'S A LIMIT OF 3 PER HOUSEHOLD/$5 MINIMUM?" and my personal favorite "Oh, you're already out of (insert penny item here)? You'd think your store would get enough inventory to cover the sale. I'm never shopping here again!" (as they come to shop on a Thursday evening while the ad has been running since Sunday), this years BTS isn't too bad so far. I've been getting PC services like crazy after a draught of $0 for the past two weeks, so thank god people are finally coming back in.   Any crazy customers? Terrible management? Fun stories? Let's hear it.   I'll start off with a fun, albeit disgusting story. A woman who I can only assume has terrible mental illness came in to have a data transfer to her new laptop. Pretty routine service. After creating the work order and ringing her up, she proceeded to talk to me for an HOUR about her personal life, how she thinks her neighbors are spying on her, and how aliens are actually God and when we go to heaven we ascend to space and join the stars. Right. The whole time I couldn't help but notice a smell of urine coming from the lady. I initially guessed she probably lived in a very messy household which was confirmed by what follows. She finally leaves, so I take her laptop and begin to work on it, starting the file transfer before going on lunch. When I came back, I noticed these small bugs all over my bench. Upon closer inspection did I learn that they were tiny, baby roaches. I guessed it was just normal (my store is about 10 years old; roaches aren't that rare to find) and smashed a few of them thinking the problem was solved. Nope.   As I'm fiddling around on her laptop, another small roach emerges from the cooling vents. And then another. And another. And another, until finally I'm disgusted and stand back to watch. At least 10 or more crawled out from her laptop which I proceeded to try and kill with a stapler. There were TONS of these terrible creatures. I finally said fuck it and let the machine transfer without me touching it. I leave for the day and come back the next only to have my manager warn me about small roaches all over the store. (this was a different LoD than the one from the other day) I tell him what happened and he shutters. To top it off, the woman wouldn't be back for another 3 days to pick up her computer. I bagged the laptop in two Hefty garbage bags and threw it into our cash office.   She finally comes in to get it three days later. I'm dreading this customer already, as I know she's going to talk to me for ages again. I open the bag and find what's best described something out of a Lovecraft story. The bag is almost full of small roaches, some of them already maturing. I scream over the radio for a manager to come in and grab the can of RAID that we have. He's like, what's the proble- and then sees it. He's about 6'4, 230 pounds. I've never heard a man scream so loud in my life. We get one of the cashiers to tell the woman that it might take a moment because we're filling out "paper work". We were actually at war with these horrifying bugs, trying our hardest to spray and smash each one before they could get everywhere.   After 15 minutes and some cleaning up, the battle was over. I gave the woman back her laptop, gave her my card, and walked away without saying a word. This is by far my worst experience dealing with a customer (indirectly) for the one and a half years I've worked for OfficeMax/Depot. Another fun bit about the computer: the keys were sticking, so I pulled back the keyboard cover and cleaned out enough hair and crumbs to make a small animal.   To say BTS has been interesting so far would be quite the understatement.
I am not a bad player, I actually am a good player (I'm not going to say "very" good because I know I have not earned that title yet) In (almost) every game I play in, im positive as a laner and jungler, and have assists for at least 1/2 of the kill in the game, i know a lot about each champion, how to counter them and such, and I think I am worthy of at least Silver II rating, instead of jumping between Bronze V and IV, I seem to get dragged down because of lesser skilled people who recently hit level 30 who feed and dont know what to do.. For example.. today, i was support sona, my adc and I recently hit 6, and when their adc overextended, i pinged, q'd and ulted him, my adc auto attacked and ran away... like... wtf..
I wanted to buy a new computer to play some games. I was not really sure on what to get, but I decided with some crappy Ibuypower system. The only reason why I got this system was because it was in stock at my local store for same day pick up. so I ordered it online, but shipping was selected instead. I was pretty disappointed, and as I am an impatient baby I called the 1800 number to see if they can cancel it and reorder it at the store. I called, gave them the order number, explained why I wanted store pickup (that's the only reason why I got this model ect) and they said there was nothing they could do, It was already shipped out. I was going to accept that, but I decided to push a bit harder. I was super nice about it, explained I was a elite plus member for years now, and if there was anything more they could do. I knew in the back of my mind that they could do nothing about it. I was wrong.   About 30 mins of being on hold, the lady got back on the phone, she says they are going to try to intercept the package, and redo the order so I can pick it up that night. I was stoked! She said there is a small chance that they could not get the package, so if it arrived, just return it to your local store. What they did was add a new computer to the order for the price of 0$ and make it a store pickup. I got my computer, it's fine, overpriced, but fine. Later that week, the other computer shows up, so I returned it like the lady over the phone asked me to do. They took the order slip on the package (the computer was sealed) scanned it, and returned it. I was thinking the return would be for zero dollars., but they refunded me the price of the whole computer. So now I have a computer that cost me 0$ bucks sitting in front of me with a moral dilemma. Should I call best buy and correct the issue? Or just keep the free computer?
So last night I was talking to my dad and the topic of racism came up. My dad hesitatingly made the comment that he thought Brigham Young was a bigot. I tested the water by escalating and commenting on his sexual abuse of women.   He immediately started lecturing me on how I shouldn't worry about things like that and how the church was about Christ blah blah blah
Ok so in my first playthrough I went in blindly and had no idea how to complete NPC's questlines. This time in NG+ I'm following the wikia guides and my Anri questline ended up in a weird way.   I've followed every step carefully doublechecking everytime, and everything was fine up until the point I reached the Darkmoon room in Anor Londo. I've been sent there by Yuria to marry Anri, right before the entrance a pilgrim gave me the cerimony sword..but when I entered the room I found her body laying on the ground, and in the cutscene my character just pierced her head with the sword.   Now...why the hell did she die if I've done every step correctly and Yuria told me to go there for the wedding?
I had it happen during my first range day with my new mosin nagant. I was using surplus ammo, if I remember correctly, I determined that the ammo was made in Bulgaria in the early 70's. I was at a public range, happily beating my shoulder into mush with the recoil, went to take another shot, pulled the trigger, and all that happens is I get a small puff of smoke in my face. I pause for a moment, confused, and then I realized what had happened. After waiting what I thought was an appropriate amount of time, I opened the bolt and examined the round. It appeared to me that the seal on the primer had failed, and vented the gases into the bolt head, rather than the round. Not the best way to end a day at the range.   My next action, however, I'm not sure was the right one. When one is at a public range, what do you do with such a round? I've been told that you are supposed to bury rounds that don't fire, but I can't very well do this at a public range. I ended up putting it in one of the barrels of spent brass. Did I make a mistake?
Too many people don't understand allergies, and, as such, think you can just "deal with it."  My daughter has severe allergies to many different foods.  There is no way to "deal with it" other than to just avoid certain foods.   Most of the foods she eats will put her into shock if she has them in any significant amount.  I have had to take her to the emergency room twice, and having an inexperienced medic try to place an IV into the arm of a screaming infant is not pleasant.
I'm running a group of 5 through LMOP. They're having a blast. At level 3 they saw the dragon, said "yikes!" and decided to return to Thundertree when they felt ready to take on the challenge (ie, not at level 3.) At this point they are about 1/3 of the way through Wave Echo Cave, have reached level 4 and have completed everything in the LMOP booklet except the dragon and Wave Echo Cave.   Two of our players couldn't make it tonight, so I sat the three others down and told them, "We're going to assume that you survive your encounters in Wave Echo Cave, and jump ahead in the storyline. You are in Neverwinter, making preparations to return to Thundertree and face the dragon. The wizard has heard rumors of an arrow of dragon slaying hidden somewhere in Neverwinter."   Long story short, they enter a small dungeon by going down a well in an abandoned courtyard. The entrance to the dungeon is about 10 feet above the water in the well. I wasn't thinking of anything special when I decided on that location; it just seemed to work as a way to get them into a dungeon.  They faced the challenges in the dungeon, got the arrow of slaying, and decided to explore the final room of the dungeon. Just for the fun of it, I rolled on magic table B in the DMG to give them something fun. I rolled a 51, which gave them a potion of water breathing.   This really was entirely by chance, but now my players are convinced that they have a potion of water breathing because they should dive into the well and explore down there. It's as if I've carefully laid the railroad tracks right in front of their noses. I might as well put a big neon sign next to the well blaring "dive in for adventure and treasure!"   So...now what? Is there any lore relating to the aquatic environment below Neverwinter? Any ideas for how to run this? Any ideas for what creatures to encounter, or what type of treasure to offer? What would some of you more experienced DMs do with this?
Dread. Game. Works. There are plenty of posts on this sub that are examples of dread game. Search them out and study them. OP, are you in good physical condition? Get in the BEST physical condition. Flirt shamelessly with ALL (even the unattracive ones, it's good practice) in wifeys presence. Deny you were flirting. Only reinforce (with your attention and affection) HER attention and affection. She MUST work for it. Continue to go out on the weekend. Get a small bottle of women's perfume (hide it at work or something where wife can't find it) and before you come in the door after the night out, put a very, very small amount on yourself.   I disagree with real-boethius below. Confessing to an affair is ultra hard dread game, and often times works with the proper frame. You (clearly) don't have proper frame. When you told her about your (barely an) "affair" it should've been along the lines of "I'm sorry you feel that way" or "Why do you care? You don't want me." not "I'm sorry I did it". I also disagree with the "stop playing her aloof games". One of the things you're doing with dread is operant conditioning, and you are starting from zero - re-establishing the relationship basis. The other part about we're having sex at 9:30 is good though, but there's got to be a carrot AND a stick. For instance, it's a little later in the evening, you walk over to where she's standing, turn her around and give her a really good kiss. If she doesn't respond, go out for the rest of the night. Above all, don't explicate, demonstrate, and if she calls you out on it explicitly, deny, deny, deny.   If she "woke up" a little bit this past weekend, reinforce that. Reciprocate her attention and affection. If hers stops, yours not only stops completely - don't speak to her unless spoken to, and grunt your responses, ignore most of what she says, avoid being in the same room as her unless she wants to physically touch you - but you leave the house more to work out, go out, what ever. Give her hamster the opportunity to spin. Talk to a female friend on the phone. A lot. Lock your cell phone. Wife will worry more about an emotional affair than a physical one, but emotional has more plausible deniability.
A friend of mine has had countless health problems her whole life. Instead of being supportive, most people we went to school with ostracized her for it. She had a cancer scare (she didn't have it, but for a couple weeks she was unsure) in sixth grade, which resulted in some awful little bitches saying she was bulimic and in the hospital for that instead of treating her potentially life-threatening situation.
As a bi woman with "moods" (I find they fluctuate with my menstrual cycle actually) I actually find this perspective interesting. I think your perception only seems a little off to me in one way: I am never "turned off" by the sex I am not currently "craving". If the emotion is there, the person is there, the love is there- there is no way I (personally) would be like "bitch please, go away, I don't want dick right now". Now, stick one dick and one vagina in front of me, and it might be another story.   I really appreciate your understanding of how difficult it is to find someone understanding, though. It really is! There's someone for everyone, though, ultimately. :)
I want an impossible game. A "limitless" sci-fi Rpg style game. You can customize your character in an incredibly in depth fashion. You get one spaceship to start out but you can customize it down to the number of visible hull rivets. You can commission more ships at a later time in the game. You can travel across the galaxy and even between galaxies later in game. You can do whatever you want as there are no quests. You can found a colony on a new planet and then cruise off to take part in an intergalactic war. There is single player and you can do more or less everything in it but you can also open your universe to as many people as you want, be they your closest friends or complete strangers. When you join another players game it is similar to fable 3 as you bring only your avatar, one ship, and whatever your ship can carry. Whatever you do in another players world is permanent, but as every world is randomly generated, their universe won't be quite the same anyway. There is also an MMO option built in. There is a massive universe server where every player in the world can play on at the same time. This game is driven by the unique economy system where you barter whatever is in your ship with other players and the computer players on single player. Think fallout 1&2 barter system. There is no way to pay real money to get ahead. You must earn resources by playing the game. You can gather as much as you can carry on your game and fly through the wormhole to the MMO mode and barter on the massive player-run marketplaces. There would be as many original races the developer could come up with but there would also be many licensed races made by other people. From Turians to Arachnids. Gameplay would consist of flying around the galaxy, monitoring your fuel and food and other supplies. Landing on planets and exploring. Mining various minerals. Charting planets. Upgrading your ship. Making contact with various alien governments and entities that have complex AI's. fighting on ground wars. Fighting in space dogfights. Opening black markets on the online mode. Selling space drugs and guns to space politicians. Anything and everything.
I can't speak for your friends, but I'm gay and reading OSC's stance on homosexuality makes me sick to my stomach. When I first read it (which is before I even knew that I was gay), I was horrified that I not only liked his books, but recommended them to others.   Admittedly, I was a teenager then, but I was a teenager who knew the difference between what the author believes and his books say (and none of his books that I've read said anything about homosexuality). And as an adult, I still have problems separating the creator from their creation; I can't stand Adam Baldwin and his characters ever since he went on this crazy rant about the evils of Canada after we won a freaking hockey game. Turns out that he's a bit too much like Casey for me to be comfortable with.
I was playing Leblanc in ranked 5's. I usually never play AP mages like LB, everything was going pretty well, my team was having fun. I wanted to try all Dorans' Rings. I was doing fine, got a couple kills. My team started losing, the enemy Pantheon dominated every lane with his notoriously strong ganks. Some of my deaths were because of my failed W's hehehe. As we got farther and farther behind the enemy team started trash talking, trash talk really gets to me. I tried to act like we we were having fun and all but in reality you still feel like absolute crap. Enemy team would make fun of me because I'm Plat, they would say things like "how does it feel like to be beaten by bronzies?" it just really ruins all the fun of Ranked 5's. 5 people gather together to have fun, enemy team trash talking just ruins it all. I know the solution is just to mute them but it doesn't feel right, I just can't do it, they're still trash talking but you can't respond to anything they say. I feel so oppressed when these things happen. I've suffered depression, I couldn't say anything on my mind at all, this is what it feels like when people do things like this. I know things like this have been posted before but please mind that other people are behind the screen, they have feelings too, they go through the same struggles, they hate being trash talked too, they're human just like you.
My evil narcissistic aunt and my dad's whole family.   My aunt (dad's sister) never liked my mother since she is a different religion than my dad - although it was never a problem for my dad. But dad was very mild mannered, so he didn't really speak up and my aunt kept butting into our lives to the point where she found a new woman for my dad to marry and  brought her to our house , lol. I don't know what she was thinking. My mom served them food before realizing what my aunt was up to. Anyway I grew up with her shit, trying to bad-mouth our mom to us when we would be at family gatherings, refusing to shake my mom's hand etc. The rest of the family would kind of enable her.   Anyway, my dad passed away two years ago. You'd think my aunt would have pity for a new widow. Nope, she went into action the next second. First, lying her way into getting important documents relating to his death and trying to get control of his accounts. Nope, blocked. But then she found a loophole. Her husband, had helped my dad out I guess at one point, and apparently his name was on the lease though my dad had been making the payments. So she made him kick us out of our house and my mom and and my younger sister had to live with my aunt (mom's sister) for a month while I crashed with a friend. This was all while I was completing high school. My mom doesn't work, so it was a kick while we were down. And the family did nothing. We're barely able to make rent each month, and my mom had to take a shitty secretarial job to keep us going. She tried mediating with my grandparents but they're also passive as fuck and take the side of their daughter.
Great feedback !  Concerning your lack of warm up and in the shape you say you are, consider just swimming for fun. Start with enjoying the fact you have this pool available, the good feeling of being in the water again. Only do the set after that, you'll have done your warm up without noticing !
So basically, i can print out a ticket that looks like a suburban express ticket, with bullshit name, a fake id, and not get into trouble. It seems, these bus drivers don't look at shit, so you might as well take advantage of it.   I wonder what the rate of stole aways are? Aside from this, A bus driver not looking at a fucking ticket, sounds like an irresponsible driver to me. How do i know he wouldn't look at a traffic sign, car, or pedestrians as he is driving.   The suburban express is quite moronic for such a policy, and its obvious its geared towards scamming the crap out of people.  Its also really funny as to how people are defending them because they haven't had any issues, and they obviously blame the passenger.  Imagine you have the same Daily routine: wake up, shower, breakfast, coffee, take the amtrak to the city (assuming chicago area), and hand the conductor your ticket.   You decide to preorder these tickets to save time each morning.  Now one unlucky day, you hand the conductor the wrong ticket, and shit hits the fan, In the amtrak policy, it stated, if you "counterfeit a ticket, you will empty out your pockets, strip you naked, and forclose your house" (yes this is extreme). How would you feel about your honest mistake? Yes, you could have been more careful, but you did this sooo often, you didn't even care that day, and now, your naked with no house.   $150 isn't terrible, in the event you actually tried to cheat the system... BUT if i give you the fucking return ticket, as my start, and the start ticket as my return, I bought 2 tickets, and i cashed them in... How is that counterfeiting? and why should you be concerned.
Well I took the plunge and bought this DLC. I initially thought 'hey, this isn't too expensive for $95k and doesn't take up too much room!'. How wrong I was.   Similar to a university, you have to level up your theme park in order to build the best rides, and to fit room for these cool rides takes up a staggering amount of space.   Sure it looks cool and generates a steady income, but you'd be better off with a standard attraction and take up much less space.
Civ is about commanding an empire. But Empires in its truest sense are multicultural and unintegrated. For example: Alexander the great didn't just conquer persia using solely greek soldiers and hoplites; he also employed the aid of some of the indians and west persians he conquered, integrating them into his army. Civ V does not reflect anything like this.   I think there should be something like that implemented in the game. You conquer an enemy, you retain their culture and their UU  UA  UB. It shouldn't be empire-wide that you get their benefits, but only in THEIR cities that you conquered. For example: You're Denmark and you conquer Sweden. You can make their hakkapelitta and carolean ONLY if you both have researched the required techs for them. You can build more of those guys IN THEIR CITIES ONLY.  Regarding the UA's, if it's unit-focused, only the units you make in the cities of those civs are taken. If it's not, maybe you can get a heavily nerfed version of that UA like for example again denmark conquers sweden, you get a 2% increase in GPP when you're friends with different civs. Another example: Denmark conquers the zulus, they can make impis but only in a zulu city, and the units they make in zulu cities has the benefits of the zulu UA.   This would probably encourage warmongering, and would also help with tall civs not having to worry as much with someone knocking on their doorstep. Another example of the UA carrying over would be india, but a nerfed version of their UA goes to the indian cities eg. 2.10x unhappines from number of cities, 0.4x unhappiness from population. Siam - just 1.4x instead of 1.5 the amount of the gifts from city states. Greece: just 9% instead of 10% on the city state decay.   I think it should be the one who conquers both the capital and defeats the leader should be the one who gets those benefits, as to not make it appealing for everyone trying to conquer everyone. It may be somewhat of a complicated idea, but hopefully you get the point.
My name is Grishfish, Ive recently been on a search for a new home.  , I left the last server I moderated due to an increase in ridiculous politics and abusive admin.  Ive tried many servers on the subreddit so far, and I just haven't seemed to find any I care to call home.  I was banned unjustly from a server I just visited, but other than that, I have a clean ban history. I have moderated, administrated, or hosted 4 servers throughout my career.  I would describe myself as a people person. I am kind and am able to deal with the immature and annoying players in a professional way. I have a great deal of knowledge in regards to using plugins, and am particularly proud of my experience with World Edit and the Voxel plugins. I'd love a new home server. One that is simple.  I can help build, set up rules, and in general just be pleasant to be around. PM or comment if you are interested in letting me help out. Thanks Much.
So I was playing Pathfinder on Wednesday. I hadn't put my deity in, and the DM insisted I put one, so I put the Helix as a joke.   Later that game, I found myself trapped in a cave, an impossible jump through / over flame to get out, and an unbeatable enemy behind me. The only thing that could save me was a miracle. So I thought "screw it, what's the worst that could happen."   "Grant me luck, Helix."   Nat 20. I clear the flames by an inch, slightly blackening my armour but escaping without injury.   Twice more that game I found myself in a situation where I was almost guaranteed to die. Both times I prayed to the Helix, and both times I was granted salvation. The Helix watches over my character, and protects him from those who would seek to do him harm.
Extremely interesting question!   I personally focus on guides and gaming news so although Markus is correct there is also a bit more going on. People obviously watch my content because they find it informative or helpful.   I think your question is more about the "Let's Play" side of YouTube video gaming channels, however.   In addition to markus' comment I'd like to add that for many younger people they want a show that is relevant to their interests. Gaming is an interest held by millions of people, especially younger people (which are the main demographic for let's play series). All of these people could watch TV where there is not really much available that is relevant to their interests or they could go on YouTube and get an infinite amount of choices in shows that are within their interest area.   Zooming out a bit. Why do gamer's watch gaming content online? Why, if there is such high demand for it is there not more gaming content on regular TV?   Gaming is an inherently interactive experience and online video content is a lot more interactive than regular TV. The barriers to entry are also a lot lower for YouTube and people are able to make some pretty high production shows about gaming.
22 Year old independent guy here who is just about to purchase his first house. I changed a lot the first year out of College/University (the 13'th school year in norway). That year matured me greatly.   To live with your parents is often a smart choice that will save you a lot of money. If you are capable of taking care of yourself, help with the household chores, make food, clean your clothes, basically be self sufficent and responsible then you living with your parents is no problem.   When it comes to not having a job. The important thing is not what you are or do right now. But what your goal/drive/ambition is, to have a plan/idea for what you want to do with your future. That is an attractive trait in my eyes.
My uncle and I were at a bar in Florida (where he lives), there were a ton of German tourists there (German tourists in Florida? I know, what a shocker). Anyway, the entire group was basically moaning and complaining about America and everyone in the bar. Now, I took German all four years of high school, am working on a German major in college and I've spent some time in country, so I got almost everything. I walked up and asked them how their trip was going so far and where they were from (in German). The looks on their faces will be something I remember until the day I die. They ended up profusely apologizing and were actually pretty cool people.   Brings me to some of the best advice as far as traveling goes I've ever gotten from a teacher: "Always assume someone around you knows the language you're speaking".

I just wanted to throw a small game tip out there. If you are playing a soldier class, and you have the DLC that unlocks it, you should definitely use this weapon, as it combos excellently with adrenaline rush. That is, the DPS of this weapon firing at maximum rounds per minute simply blows away all other assault rifles. Fully upgraded, this thing kills collector drones in four headshots (with 10% damage headpiece). This combos very well with adrenaline rush, for the slowing of time makes the max RPM easily achievable. With this setup I beat insanity difficulty with ease.
Every white person here is (has) a master('s) in racism. Every colored person here has a doctorate." - Allen750   What is 'de jure' law and what is 'de facto' culture?   de jure :  written  norms; the way it should be.   de facto :  unwritten  norms; the way it is.   What is a 'norm' ?   norm : a rule; something to be followed.   Why does this matter? A short version:   The Civil Rights Law passes, it's a bit past 1964, racism didn't end. It merely became subtle. The 'BLACKS ONLY' & 'WHITES ONLY' signs disappeared, forcing racism to go underground (practice by de facto culture).   Why? Because racist BS became de jure illegal (written into law). Of course, the south knew their loopholes.   Let's use Jim Crow for example, like the 'literacy test':   Who's administering the test? Most likely a white male. Who's controlling the judicial/legal system? White males. Who's voting? Only white males.   Who's  trying  to vote? Black males.   Due to years of being fucked over ( by anti-reading laws, and general lack of education, blacks couldn't read. Blacks failed the test. But so did whites; however, guess who's administering the test? Your white male friend of course! It's a small town. The cop don't mind. The judge don't mind. The politician being elected don't mind.   So there you have it. Changing the law is one thing, but changing the culture, the societal norms that people follow, is another thing.   Modern Progression   The system's real clever fucking over people of color.   Remember this ( Well, America's one of those special countries where we fund taxes based on local incomes; George Lipsitz writes:   "By channeling loans away from older inner-city neighborhoods and toward white home buyers moving into segregated suburbs, the FHA and private lenders after World War II aided and abetted the growth and development of increased segregation in U.S. residential neighborhoods. For example, FHA appraisers denied federally supported loans to prospective home buyers in the racially mixed Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles because it was a "'melting pot' area literally honeycombed with diverse and subversive racial elements."1" (page 373,
When I was about 8, there was an old barn a little bit away's from my house. I was a bit of a pyromaniac, and since the barn was entirely abandoned, I thought, hey! it'd be a great idea to go light that barn on fire. It'd be so cool! It was too wet and windy and I eventually gave up, but looking back on it now I can't help but wonder what made me think that'd be a good idea.
I recently started getting up at 5am to workout before heading to classes and work. I hadn't worked out regularly since high school (6+ years ago) mainly because of being so drained at the end of the day between work and school. I don't feel like I am getting a real strong workout in like I used to. My dilemma is that I just feel tired and start to lose interest in lifting. I do a bit of a jog to warm up, but it wears off quickly (plus I don't wanna do too much cardio, as the FAQ says cardio and lifting should be spread out). I have lost 20 lbs in the last month so I really want to start bulking now and cutting back some of the cardio.   I was wondering about the pre-workout supplements and if there are some that aren't so heavy in caffeine. I have gotten chest pains/uncomfortability when drinking the energy drinks that are packed full of caffeine and have since avoided them. Although I imagine caffeine is the main point of most pre-workout supplements. I was also trying to find one that is NSF certified and such, even though I don't actively participate in any official sports, I would prefer that the chemicals I put into my body are somewhat known to be safe. Any other recommendations to keep energy up is also welcomed. I have found some stuff so far   What I have found so far on my own:   Proven4 Pre Game   Extreme Edge Pre-workout   Cytosport FAST TWITCH
I definitely regret it.  I think the first time is probably more important for a girl than a guy, but that being said I still wish mine could have gone better.  In high school me and a group of friends somehow got in tight with a group of really rich girls from a different school.  The one girl's parents were ridiculously loaded and had 5 different houses in the area so there was always one house that was open with no supervision.  I know this part was awesome but back to the awkward first time.  Basically I was a virgin to just about everything the night we went over to party with these girls.  I hadn't ever done more than maybe a 5 second french kiss and this was as a senior in high school.  Although I was inexperienced I wasn't afraid of girls I just thought high school relationships were pretty pointless and hadn't really met the right girl.  The girl who was the host basically called me out for being a pussy and said I wouldn't get with her even if she offered.  I was drinking a lot of Goldschlager that night so I just went for it and kissed her really intensely with I think surprised her but also turned her on.  We ended up going up stairs and getting naked.  I fingered her which was really new to me and I was already way passed my experience level.  My friend knocked on the door at some point and I was all freaking out telling him how far I was getting.  At some point she basically asked if I was a virgin and I said yes.  She was definitely not.  She asked me if I wanted to know what it felt like to stick it in her so I of course said yes.  She basically let me get it fully in to where I was getting the idea of how amazing it felt and then told me to stop.  It was awful and my friends called me 50% (virgin) for the rest of the year.  I ended up running into her at a party in college the next year and did her in a bath room so that kind of put a bit of closure on the situation.  Either way I would have liked to have been with someone I actually dated and cared about for the first time.
Hahaha, I didn't even think about that. I spelled it from memory. After reading your comment I thought for moment that I embarrassed myself, but apparently it's correct.   The Ukrainian name of the club is Шахтар Донецьк, whereby Шахтар translates to "miner" and Донецьк to Donezk, obviously. Transcribed from the Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet it is written Shakhtar in English and Schachtar in German. My best guess is that the difference is due to a better phonetic resemblance. Well so far my spelling is wrong, but apparently the club is also traditionally know under the Russian variant of it's name, Шахтёр Донецк (notice the slightly different Cyrillic spelling), which is transcribed to Schachtjor Donezk in the German version of the Latin spelling. The English equivalent would be Shakhter or much rarer Shakhtyor.
Honestly should be mentioned as one of the better trades in MLB history, especially considering the benefits we may continue to reap.   To recap, we directly received Alcides Escobar and Lorenzo Cain, 2 of our 3 best all-around players (not to mention Cain = ALCS MVP). Not only that, but we dumped a huge salary AND also received Jake Odirizzi in that trade, who was part of that deal where we got those guys James Shields and Wade Davis (I know Myers was the real chip in that trade, but Odirizzi was no small piece).
You don't  need  a master's degree, but it is helpful.  It's required in oil because they write big paychecks and can therefore be picky.  You can get into mining or environmental work with a BS. I worked in mining for several years before going to grad school. You need a solid understanding of chemistry and structural geology to really understand what's going on when it comes to ore deposits.   As an undergrad you will need to take at least through calculus 2, two semesters of chemistry and two semesters of physics (especially if you're planning on grad school.)  I always recommend that students take as much math as they can, at least through differential equations.  Geology is a science that incorporates math, physics, chemistry, and biology.  Depending on how you want to focus your studies, it may behoove you to load up on chemistry or physics courses.  I did undergrad research that was practically all chemistry.
intelligent design is a term creationist use to make creationism sound scientific. Saying things like, "there must be designer because life is wonderfully complex and there is no way this all just happened my chance" and "there is no use in half an eye".  Term "intelligent design" was invented as a way to get around the supreme court case Edwards v. Aguillard, that ruled it was unconstitutional to have a law that forced the teaching of creationism.  There is tons of evidence that disproves intelligent design, lots can be found in the books of Richard Dawkins.
the week of thanksgiving, and shortly after my twenty-first birthday, i was supposed to fly from seattle to san antonio, with a quick change in denver. i miss my 6am sunday flight because of traffic--i literally arrived two minutes after check-in closed. i swear at myself a little, say alright, my bad, and reschedule for monday. in the meantime, my parents are swearing at me as well--they flew denver to san antonio at a much higher cost so they could meet me there and then drive as a fam to just outside of corpus christi...i have now fucked these plans. they drive on ahead, testily.  i show up early monday, and have a three hour delay in seattle because 'something is hanging off the side of the plane.' direct quote. turns out its something completely harmless, but it took three hours to find an engineer to say so. i have missed not only my scheduled connection out of denver to san antone, but also the one they preemptively rescheduled me for. i get to dia, run to the customer service desk, and they put me on the next flight out to dallas, on a different airline. im actually alright with this because they then schedule me from dallas to corpus, so my father is less likely to kill me. or so i thought.  flight out of denver has to veer around a storm, and i arrive in dallas fifteen minuted after my flight to corpus has left. the next connection is in five hours. six hours and a trip to tgi fridays later, i come to my senses in the wrong concourse, covered in my own urine. the lovely gentleman at the bar with whom i was discussing the finer points of rugby had bought me tequila. and so had the next guy. and the bartender.  nine shots later, ive missed my connection and pissed myself. luckily, i carried all my luggage on. i change and answer my phone (13 missed calls)--my father has listed me as missing and thinks ive been murdered. after an hour long intervention via phone, i pass out next to the gate for the first connection out to corpus with a note on my face asking to be awoken for the flight. they changed the gate whilst i slept. woke up an hour after it left to more enraged father calls. totally valid. (so sorry, dad...) almost miss the next flight cause i was puking. get to corpus two days late.  return trip, i missed three more flights due to mechanical issues. (not me this time).
You said there is nothing to clarify, but what I was clarifying is valid information. That's where you said I was wrong.   I'm not even going to read past this, you just want to argue to argue. Maybe you should stop by /r/circlejerk. I'm not going to deal with this shit. What I said was valid and you can just deal with not agreeing with it internally because it's not my problem it's yours. Washing roots is not needed in this case in any way shape or form and nothing you can say can make it so and I've seen root washing by noobs kill plants first hand and it should not be recommended to them, especially for this case of just needing to be transplanted to larger containers.
I don't know if this is the right place, but here it goes!   Me [17F] and my close friend [17F] are going to be seniors in high school this fall. We've been friends for five or six years, and very close for the past year or so. She's helped me through a cold-hearted ex-best friend, a long titular relationship, and so many personal problems, and I'm happy to say that I've helped her a lot as well.   Through our high school we go to the local college and take courses there, so we'll be going there for college next year (fall of 2014). So we've been thinking of becoming roommates and getting an apartment together. Living at home is not an option for either of us because my home environment is not friendly, and she wants freedom ASAP. The only problem is, I'm not sure if it's such a good idea.   The pros of the situation is that we're similar in a lot of ways. We both love to party (but respect time to study), agree on getting a cat, are respectful and open with relationships, handle money well, are responsible, and we're both generally good people. Not to mention after reading all the horrible roommate stories on here, I'm not exactly excited to go sign a lease with a stranger.   However, there are some cons. I'm a bit messy, but in comparison she is an extreme slob, although her mess can be contained to her room. She can be a bit unreliable at times whereas I can get a bit neurotic. And overall I am a bit more high strung, ambitious, and organized and she is a bit more relaxed, ditzy, and and spontaneous.   I would honestly love to be her roommate, but I'm so scared of ruining our friendship over it. I know there is so much time to determine this, but the earlier I can make a decision, the better! Is it a good idea to move in with my close friend for college next fall? If so, any tips, tricks, or advice to help our friendship? Thanks!
I've had the whole "ready for marriage whenever you are!" talk with my SO. Much like you, I don't want some giant, flashy thing, but I'd like something beautiful in it's own way (and hopefully easier on the pocket!). I don't necessarily even want a diamond..   I can't even tell you what I would do if I was in your spot.. I think I'd feel the same way you do. Being frugal is one thing, making a weak attempt at proposing with a garbage-ass (sorry, kinda) ring is an entirely different one! I hope things improve for you..
I was thinking WDYWT in the sense of a full outfit but I realized that people rarely post photos of themselves past their knees.   I honestly don't mind outfit grids that much if it brings up useful discussions about how to dress with sneakers. Unfortunately most of them consist of the same two questions:     What kind of pants are those? (...joggers)   What brand are those joggers? (Publish, Mercer, or Zanerobe)     Requiring a comment detailing the outfit would prevent the same questions being asked over and over but then again, we might be getting into /r/streetwear territory.
Hello /r/relationships, this is on a throwaway because people know my real account and I just have to get some advice from someone on this.   I have been friends with this girl let's say named Jennifer for 7 years. Jennifer is the girl of my dreams. I have loved her, been there for her, and tried to do everything to make this girl as happy as can be. I knew her in 9th and 10th grade in high school and then moved 7 seven hours away but we still kept in touch with Facebook. I went to a school in that state and she went to one in hers (parents wanted her to stay home for college understandably) but we stayed in touch tremendously well. We have always been able to talk for countless hours every single day with neither of us getting bored. I can honestly say I have never had such an amazing connection with another human being.   My freshman year of college I went there to potentially ask her to be my girlfriend. While I was up there I got scared (one of the biggest regrets of my life) and thought that maybe I shouldn't tie myself down so early in college. Even after her obvious disappointment we still remained friends and talked. She after a year started dating a guy named Steve who was weird and gross, and dumped him. Then a year and a half ago she started dating Matt. Matt's a decent guy and I didn't want to get in the way of there happiness so I backed off. Fast forward to now and we are all juniors in college. In the early stages I only occasionally talked to her but was keeping my eye out on her. After this amount of time I realized that they were most likely going to stay together and wanted to at least make my feelings known. However, before I could do so she came to me and said that she still had feelings for me. She also said that she felt this way because she could always talk to me and I listened to her and valued her input while Matt did not always do so. She has said many times that she has felt we are soul mates and I have felt the same.   I was obviously really happy but didn't want to be a dick to Matt and said that she should think this over and definitely tell him about it and figure that situation out. She did and tells him that it's over and that she wants to date me. I'm ecstatic and say that we should wait a bit out of respect, but still stay in touch and start dating at an appropriate time. She then tells me that after she broke up with him she got a call from Matt asking her to take 3 days to think it over and if she still wanted to leave him then he would accept it, but that he wants her to at least think about it. Perfectly reasonable I thought and was assured by Jennifer she would not be changing her mind.   Fast forward to a few days ago where she calls me crying saying "I can't be with you" and "I'm sorry I just can't do this to Matt even if I like you more". I'm obviously heartbroken and try to ask why she would rather be with someone that won't make her as happy, and that she doesn't feel as close to which she replies "I just don't want to hurt him and I just feel it's the right choice." I try and talk to her more but she hangs up and says that we shouldn't talk anymore.   Please help me Reddit. I know this is a bit of a sob story. I know I'm young and there are plenty of other great people but the heart wants what it wants. I know this girl better than anyone and it just sucks losing a possible lasting relationship and the best friendship I ever had. For those 3 days I was planning the future, who would move where, how jobs would work, when I could propose, and it all just feels like its come crashing down. Is there any hope for this or should I just mourn and move on?
Hello my fellow wow addicts.   Recently the problem of gear progression has come up especially when it comes to the future legendary weapons. That problem being that as we progress from expansion to expansion we give up our bad ass powerful weapons for generic blues. For example after wrath players have up shadowmourne for a generic blue sword in cata. How do we justify giving up the Lich King's sword so we can use a more powerful "Bastard sword of the monkey?"   I'm not sure how many of you have played Destiny, but anyways, with the new expansion they added a new way to get more powerful gear. Instead of equipping new gear that has better stats, players can now infuse their new gear into their old gear. This allows them to keep the old gear that they like while still progressing in power.   However, bungee doesn't allow a 1:1 power level exchange. For example if you infuse a level 290 piece of gear with a 300 piece of gear the old gear does not become 300. I'm not sure of the algorithm for this but I believe it's close to the average of the two.   Also, a chest piece can only be infused by a chest piece. A chest piece can't be infused by a pair of boots.   Blizzard could implement something similar to this. This would allow us to keep the gear that we fell in love with. It would allow our legendary weapons to be viable once again. Instead of transmog, where the appearance changes, we can actually have the gear with the power that it deserves.
Monty's method of choosing the door is of the utmost importance here. He will choose to open a door specifically so that:     it was not your choice   it does not have the car behind it     If more than one door has both of these properties, he will pick randomly.   Also, the car is always placed randomly behind any one of the three doors. THis is all integral to the problem having the 1/3:2/3 solution.   So we don't know much about the problem, but we know which door you chose, and that makes it 'special' because Monty can't ever pick it. This is why we group the doors by "ones you choose" and "ones you didn't choose"(call these sets A and B respectively).   Now we don't know where the car is, so we break it into cases based on whether the car is in A or B. When Monty opens a door, he will always leave A closed(because you picked it) and reduce B to one door(either one has the car and he opens the other, or he picks randomly), so when we are left with the "stay or switch" moment, we can choose between A and it's 1/3 chance, and B with it's 2/3 chance.     In your splitting, where you pick 1 and 3 as a group (let's call it A with a 2/3 chance of winning) and 2 as a group (called B with 1/3 chance of winning), it's not as easy to break down into cases for where the car is and which door monty picks, because Monty could pick a door in A now, which he couldn't before. In particular, when the car is behind 3, Monty opens 2 and you no longer have a choice to switch between A and B, because both the doors he left closed are in A.
haha ok, sure.  I guess being logical and open minded makes me a bad person.  Im glad you could deduce that from one sentence, and make a decision of the kind of person I am, by reading one single comment on the internet. Hell, I even gave you a link, to see all the people who have died from water.  I hoped it was a cunning joke, a quick jab at our political system.  Things like tobacco, alcohol, big pharma, all legal in this country, with death rates in the thousands per year, and addiction at an all time high (lol high), and yet weed is STILL illegal.  Sorry you didnt get the joke.
The same way any performance is practiced. The music and choreograph is learned and practiced in a dance studio. When they go on tour they already have everything planned. Every show is the same. No matter the city or venue. They have the same set list of songs in the same order. Yes they practice the run through of the show the entire day before and the day of the show. They have to have a set plan because a lot of really popular preformers dont have time to improvise and prolong venues because they are on such a strict schedule. On two occasions (one with deadmau5 the other with iron maiden) the preformers had to be flown to the venue via helicopter because they had a show in another city that just ended.
Copied from my blog at:   I really don't know what to make of Civilization 5. There's so much of it that I enjoy, the hex based system, the fact the stack has been removed, the addition of ranged attacks, the way cities can defend themselves, the simplified happiness and economy system, the new way strategic resources work, the way units can cross water on their own... it's all really good. But you know what? I think I actually prefer Civilization 4.   Before reporting to the comment section and flaming me for 'hating on the new' please allow me to explain. I've been playing Civilization since Civ 2. I loved it. I played civ 3, I loved it. I played civ 4 and I ADORED it. For me, Civilization 4 has everything that makes the Civ games so good. It had very well thought out diplomacy, the culture mechanic was excellent, the religion mechanic was difficult to learn but very powerful, and culture flipping meant it was possible to capture cities without ever needing to fire a single shot.   Civilization 5 has stripped most of that down and put all it's extra effort into one particular theatre- war.   Warfare in Civilization 5 is excellent, it can compete with the best of turn based strategy games in that regard. War has always been a central element to the Civ series, pick up any Civ game and you'll notice how most of the units are combat units. But I just feel that Civilization 5 takes this too far. You can still get culture, diplomatic and scientific victories too, but many of the diplomatic options have been stripped down, and many of the features of culture (such as flipping) have also been removed. Espionage is also strangely absent. Nothing has been put in to replace them either.   It's quite sad really. So many brilliant new features have been packed into Civilization 5, and yet the removal of just a few little bits from Civ 4 totally changes the feel of the game.   I think if you're looking for a turn based wargame, Civ 5 is certainly a worthy purchase. But if you're actually looking for a true Civilization game, I'd wait until these features are added in the inevitable expansion packs or fan mods. I've completed a game, and to be honest I just don't feel like going back and playing another one. At all. When there's something I can do with/to other civs besides blowing their heads off, I'll come back to it. Until then though Civ 5 will be collecting dust on my hard drive.   Incidentally, if anyone knows of a good mod that adds all this stuff I'm whining about back in, please let me know. Civ 4's features + the changes listed above would equal total, unequivocal, win.
I agree with you pretty much completely. It's one thing to ask for a recommendation, but when a poster has a specific book/series in mind, it seems like they're lazy, petulant, trying to be controversial or edgy, or some combination of the three.   I'll grant that I  can  see some of the reasoning behind using the phrase "convince me," but only if it's associated with a specific problem. For example, say I read a review saying "This ten-book series is the best series ever! If you love epic fantasy and heroic quests and magic swords, this is the series for you! RIYL Tolkien, Sanderson, and Weeks." I think, "I love all those things and all those authors; this series sounds great! I'm going to read it!" But then I read the first book and am terribly disappointed because it doesn't seem anything like the review. I  might  turn to a forum, explain my situation, and say, "Fans of Tolkien, Sanderson, Weeks, and this ten-book series, can you convince me to keep reading, or do you think it won't be worth my time?" Someone might respond, "I had exactly the same experience, but I read book two and it was everything I was hoping it would be so you should definitely keep reading and it'll become your favorite series."   That's the kind of "convincing" that might actually work. But that's a very specific situation and it's not what most posters are doing when they use the word convince, so overall I definitely agree with your gripe.
You will be fine, its a great game that has had an amazing story so far. However the game is set within the same universe as the comics and whilst not having read them will not hamper your understanding the story, I feel that I appreciated the game a lot more having read them.
There's this girl in my Business Calc class at my university that's really pretty that I've had a thing for for a while. I've thought about asking her out after class, but the inner debate always comes up about whether or not it would be weird to ask her out for lunch/coffee despite never having spoken a word to her before.   I was planning on approaching her after class when she's walking out of the building and introducing myself, hopefully getting her name as well (which I don't know), and after making small talk about where we sit in relation to each other/what her opinion on the professer is, I'd say something to the effect of " Hey, I know we just met, but I'd really love to get some coffee with you sometime soon" (though that is obviously subject to change).   To clarify: I am a somewhat attractive male, likely a 6 or 7/10, with a good sense of humor, self-worth, and hygiene. She is likely a 7 or 8, though I have literally nothing to go on in the personality department. I want to reiterate: I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO THIS GIRL BEFORE, so I know literally nothing about her. She has likely seen me before, but neither of us have interacted beyond glances, which she may not even be reciprocating.   Would this be weird? Or should I go for it?
I've asked this question here on ATZ  a while back, and this is what I have learned.   Because +1 carapace doesn't actually do anything (same # of shots to kill in a roach war), +1 evens out with 1/1. Now because +1 carapace costs 150 minerals & gas, you can afford more roaches if you only go for the attack upgrade. That's why a lot of pro players go for only attack upgrade - they don't want to waste money on a useless upgrade.   2/2, however, does shine against 2/0 because +2 missile will require 1 less hit to kill a +0 carapace, but +2 carapace and withstand +2 missile as if they were both on 0/0 (Think of it like this - attacker does +2 damage but the defender takes -2 damage -> no net change in damage taken). Because 2/2 roaches make 2/0 roaches upgrades obsolete, +2 carapce is actually worth it. And THAT is why people go for double evo - to get that +2 quicker.   The funny thing is that 2/1 evens out with 2/2 anyway. So getting +2 carapace costs 150 + 225 = 375 minerals & gas, which could've been more oraches, hydras, or 3 infestors.   A lot of people just get a second evo around the time their +1 missile is done. And then they get +2 missile and +1 carapace. If your opponent went for double evo and is getting 2/2, well, 2/1 will make the +2 carapace useless and thus you will gain that 225 mineral & gas advantage. It's such a small difference though, and unless your competing in a very high level, that won't make much difference.   It DOES make a difference in early-mid game though, when your going for that +1 timing. Because your opponent will have 150 min & gas worth of less roaches, your timing will be stronger.   FYI 3/3 evens out with 3/2, but still get +3 carapace because in late game it's not about pure roaches!
So, over Christmas break I went into a Best Buy to get my mom a chrome cast for her TV for Christmas. At the purchase lane, I was asked If I wanted to set up a Best Buy rewards account. I politely declined, but after the cashier said "Are you sure?...You would save 30% (or some appealing percentage that escapes me now) on your purchase today". So i figured "What the hell, there's no harm in that". So i began entering in my credentials, annual income, address and whatnot. After a few minutes, I start to question how long this is taking and how much info I'm having to enter in multiple times. I was asked to enter my SSN into the keypad and knew something was up. Soon the manager came out and the cashier was grinning at me. I was asked to verify my birth date and the last digits of my SSN again. I was then informed that I had won $2,000 in store credit.   I was in disbelief. I, having just turned 18 a couple of months before Christmas, had never had much financial experience and didn't know what to do with the money. The cashier seemed to be genuinely happy for me and she asked if I wanted to "go back into the store and buy anything else" she also told me "not to go spending all that money too quickly". I just left with what I had bought, and cried out of happiness on the drive home, avoiding going back into the store and making impulse purchases.   So when I got home, I read the terms pamphlet that I was handed when I was informed of my "luck". It seemed to be as good as I was told it was. I tried to double check everything; even the circled "Available Store Credit: $2,000" that the cashier had written on my chrome cast receipt. After making sure I wouldn't have to pay any of it back, I went back to the store a day or two later and picked out a few items in elation. Before purchasing, I spoke to the manager and even asked multiple employees walking around and asked If I would have to pay anything back, ever, ensuring that I would be debt-free.   So over the course of about a month, I spent all $2,000 on a TV, Ipad, PS4/games for my college roomates, and various Christmas present surprises for my friends back home and at college. I was extra careful to make sure I didn't spend a penny more than the $2,000 and I didn't and I was also careful to keep every receipt and the card terms.   During the time of all of these purchases, except the PS4/games, I did not have a physical card and was making these purchases by having the cashier look up my account info via me entering credentials and locating my account. When my card came in the mail, nearly a month later, I activated it and looked at my account.   I was confused to see that I had a payment due that equated to $2,024 with 27% interest. I didn't know what to do. I'm a college student already struggling to make ends meet financially and I don't know what to do with this exponentially growing problem. I can't deal with this stress in my life right now. I've already dealt with suicide attempts/depression due to the death of a girlfriend and best friend and I don't know how I'm going to get past this. I just don't understand the legality of what they're doing and I don't know where to turn and I don't think I can get legal help to battle this, because I don't know if they technically did anything illegal. They just abused the ignorance of a kid and mislead them. I just don't know how to deal with this and I really need help. I don't want to have to struggle any more with loans and I can't ask my friends to return gifts that I gave them. How can people be so cruel? Cheating people during Christmas I just don't get it. Best Buy is a vile company.   Any guidance/help is appreciated more than you will ever know. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
I've seen a lot of the videos mentioned, and they are all very disturbing. But the one that keeps me up at night doesn't involve any person dying. Instead, it's a video by some animal rights group about how dogs are treated inhumanely in China. Seriously, worst thing I've ever seen. So bad, there is no way I am going to try to find it and re-awaken that memory.   Video
Some other day then" and shrug it off like nothing. If you don't already have her number, "some other day then, write down your number on my phone". See? No questions   Then try again a week or two after. If she doesn't put the effort reschedule with you by the second time you ask her, just next her. She's not interested in you.   Now don't just sit there and wait for her, try to spin other plates while you put her on the back burner. If she doesn't come around then no big deal, you'll be looking for other girls that whole time if you don't already have contact with other chicks.   Also, a couple of more tips. The "I have some free time on Friday" is unnecessary and a tiny bit beating around the bush. It should be "Lets get coffee at 1pm Friday." You should never have to explain yourself, ever. It kills the mystery for women when you explain things plus you come off as more alpha/masculine this way. Be careful when they ask you personal questions on your date too. Like what you do, where you work, what you study (dismiss this with a funny joke about you being top secret CIA or something). It'll send their hamsters spinning and create what they want to see in their heads which will make you more interesting for them.
Never heard of it. I just think its a pity that i only have limited time, i'll never learn if mankind makes it through the next 1000 years. Neither if the universe expands or contracts. There are so many things i would like to know.   Dying itself doesn't look much fun either.   Being dead isn't a problem tho, no soul, no mind, no body, no pain.   It's just a bummer that the universe will run for so long and i only get to see 80 years. Someone should do something about it. Fast!   Since my time is limited, it has much greater value tho. I couldn't strap a bomb to my butt and blow myself up or fight the ottomans in a holy war.
I've never cleverly talked myself out of a speeding ticket, but I've talked myself into a ticket before.  I got pulled over for speeding (35 in a 30 zone) by a motorcycle cop and the officer noticed I wasn't wearing a seat belt.  When he pointed this out to me, I said, "Well, neither were you."  I didn't even realize I was saying it and definitely had an, "Oh shit" moment.  The officer than told me he would have just given me a warning, but I just, "shit all over my chances of that happening."
To move to a NAS style solution is going to cost more money than you want to spend. If your drives are already detachable, you can plug them into your laptop and utilize Plex when you want it and shut it down when you don't. Another option to look at that will allow you the flexibility of moving your storage around is iTunes & an AppleTV. You can point iTunes to an external drive (and Plex for that matter) so your library is not on your ssd. When you are not using iTunes, you shut it down and be done with it.   If you prefer the Xbox to the PS3 (My preference is the other ways for a number of reasons, among them that the PS3 is still among the best blue ray player out there and has a host of additional functionality . I get it that the Xbox has the greater mind share.) you may want to look at Windows Media Center on Windows 7. No one does Microsoft like Microsoft.   As flippant as you may think I was being, the PS3 Media server is a no cost solution along with Handbrake which supports batch transcoding means you spend $0.00 on extending your setup and utilize your existing hardware. Handbrake will encode both AVIs and MKV to MP4s which the PS3 understands and you can stream.
So... I have some ideas involving Dragons, of varying races and sizes, with obvious different habbits and different positions within the dragon "Civilization" I'm not much of a madder. (Not at all actually) But I figured besides the forum, this was the best place to look. Some of the varying races include: Ice Dragons, Storm Dragons, Scarlet (Typical) Dragons, Stone (Mountain) Dragons, Stone (Cave) Dragons, Freshwater Dragons, Saltwater Dragons, (Both amphibious of course) And more to come.   Dragons will have three different classes (For now) Leader, Soldier, Egg-sitter.
Hey everybody, let me preface this first by saying I have already set up an appointment with my adviser and done some research on this subreddit about transfer logistics.   I'm currently a Sophomore Chemical Engineering major and after last years chemistry and lab classes nearly wrecking me I naively thought I could rough through orgo and mass and balance and eventually another two years worth of classes but I'm getting to the point where I just can't stand to even look at chemical equations anymore. I also find it hard to compete with people who are insanely intelligent in chemistry and seem to memorize every detail perfectly, That being said, I'm sick of chemistry to the point where I'm having test anxiety and it has started to affect my other classes and more important my GPA which isn't the best (2.6). Physics and Math so far haven't been awful it's just the chem I'm starting to loathe.  I'm interested in transferring out to something non-engineering and hopefully something dealing with what I originally wanted to do (persuaded by my parents to not pursue against my better judgement) which was law enforcement possibly even a career in government, FBI ect.
Hmm, well I tend to have a very scientific mind and, as such, approach things in a scientific way. And the first thing that any scientist would tell you is that  anecdotal evidence is not evidence at all . I'm not saying that I doubt the sincerity of the man you spoke with, but I can pretty much guarantee that the things he described didn't go down the way he said they did. Our mind will mold our memories in a way that suits us.   Let me give an example, and this is a true story: Before I lost my faith, I was tacitly a Christian. Once when I was driving home from school (I lived ~100 miles away from home), it was raining... HARD. I also had an old car with poor wipers. It got to the point where I could hardly see 10 feet in front of me. It was in a desolate 2-lane portion of the highway, and I was legitimately scared I was going to run off the road and potentially hurt myself or even die. I was legitimately afraid for my life at this point. I could have pulled over, but there was no shoulder and I was afraid someone would rear-end me. So what could I do? I prayed. I prayed to my god that I was scared and I didn't want to die. And less than a minute after, the weather started to clear. This is  not  an exaggeration, I swear.   I consider this a "spiritual" experience. If I were devout right now, I could easily spin that in a way that provided anecdotal proof of God's existence. But seeing as I'm not, I merely see it as a coincidence. Now, I don't believe in a spiritual realm, but I consider this a spiritual experience because it was a moment where I felt more than what I can see and touch. And, unfortunately, (as Sam Harris has spoken about) religion seems to have a monopoly on spiritual experiences... and those tend to be the most important experiences in a person's life.   I realize I went off topic, my bad.
Gallery here:   Nudie slim jims, 28 waist and I had the bottoms taken up to around a 30".  The shot of the tape measure shows the distance from the top of the jeans to the bottom.   My mom washed these in cold water (without asking clearly) after about 3 months wear, while I was back home visiting over christmas.  They were air dryed once I discovered her treachery.  Only time they have been washed.   SO.  I have no idea how to sell dry denim.  Am I supposed to wash these jeans before I mail it out?  Not sure how that works, or what the value of a pair of once-washed dry jeans would go for.  As it sits they're very nice dark jeans, and I love the slim jim fit.  I just need around a 29 or 30 waist, unfortunately.
I am going to disagree with this.  I am all for discussions about the show/episodes/universe and it can be great sometimes.  But I think part of what makes this subreddit great is that we can enjoy other's expirences of DWIRL (Doctor Who In Real Life) whether it is their cake, costume, poster, painting, lamp, ect.  We also have all of our little in jokes that, while they require knowledge of the series, do not necessitate discusion but certainly brighten our day with a laugh.  I do not think it is a good idea to limit the great (and not so great) content of this subreddit just to highlight one of the aspects that not everyone may enjoy.  Everything together makes this a subreddit that I enjoy visiting.
I was a 13 year old at a birthday party sleepover at a mates house. I was playing snooker on a $20, 000 pool table, and me and my mates were joking about drawing a dick on it. In a moment of stupidity, I took my pool cue and with the rubber end, drew a giant dick on this expensive pool table.   The father was absolutely furious, although he didn't kick me out or tell my parents, he left that to me. It ended up costing $1000 dollars, half of which was covered on insurance, the other half I paid back to my parents, who had written a cheque for re-felting the table.   $1000 was a massive amount of money to me at the time, and it took me ages to pay my parents the $500 I owed back. That actually started a pretty shitty time in my life, as most people at school thought I was a dickhead for doing it, rightly so, as did my family.   I remember sitting in the next room realising what I had done, just staring at the floor. Then the accusatory exclamation, 'Who did that?'. The thought still haunts me.
Basically I've played for about 16 days now and I've met nothing but assholes at every corner.   I first rolled a PvP server, ended up getting camped at level 20 by 90s in my questing hub. I quit and rerolled a PvE server. My fault as I should have expected something like this. No biggy.   Once again, around level 20, I'm questing and a Human Mage just runs around AoEing all the packs in front of me just so I couldn't get any kills. She wasn't killing any faster since she went back to single targeting after pulling the mobs but... seriously?   Everyone time I hunt a quest boss with a low respawn rate and I see another player there I just go do another quest and come back.   But no one ever has that consideration when I'm questing. Questing in the Zangarmarsh was aggravating as people started camping the bosses while I was already waiting. Luckily I had an AoE spell I just kept spamming and got the kills.   And now today... I finally hit 83 and went to fight the Dragon guarding one of the pillar fragments.   I get there before anyone, set my standard, and then a Night Elf Hunter shows up. At first I think "sweet, he's being polite!" as he was waiting behind me. The boss comes, I kill him, and when I go to click on the fragment, the asshole runs in front of me and clicks it first.   Turns out I can't loot the fragment after him despite me getting the kill (what brainiac decided that was a good mechanic?).   Lucky the boss was easy but it really put a damper on my day. I don't know what I expect on an online game but... really? Can't people act more civil to each other?   I don't know... Are there a lot of players out there like this? Obviously not everyone's immature but are other new players experiencing what I'm experiencing?   Or are racial hatreds that deep in WoW? Do Alliance and Horde players seriously go out of their way to screw over the other factions players outside of PvP?
We have been separated since August of Last year. I was angry at first but I had come to accept it. We were friendly. Most of my friends were confused by his behavior because he would behave in the same way he did when we were together. He would come over every night to put the children to bed. We would talk and still have intimate conversations and occasionally have sex. I began distancing myself emotionally and stopped having sex with him.   I was fine until the day of the divorce and then I snapped. I have been incredibly mean to him. I told him he is not allowed to come into my house or talk to me if it is not about the children or finances. I give him short, kurt answers and try to be as unpleasant as possible. He on the other hand says he will not be disrespectful and that he wishes me the best.   I know my behavior is counterproductive but I cannot hinder my feelings of anger and sometimes rage towards him. I know that he is not happy because I notice it in our interactions but I want to crush him. I know these feelings are unreasonable. I don't want to feel them anymore but I can't stop them.
I really enjoy watching these close games on SMITEGAME and honestly, just watching all the tournament games for the smite weeklies for NA and EU. What I don't enjoy is the fanboy vs fanboy in chat ( or in my case fangirl vs fanboy ). All these teams put in tons and tons of hours into this game to master their gods and hone their skills and without these players this game would be NOTHING. No competitive scene, no one to learn from or look up to, no one to cheer for.   Now I'm not saying you shouldn't cheer for your favorite team or player, because you totally should.. that's why we all sit for 6-7 hours to watch these casts & games, but when it comes to witch hunting  players using in game commands, like laugh or taunt ( that hi rez studios put into the game themselves ) or posting something sarcastic on twitter, it gets a little ridiculous.   Too many tears and whiners in this community. People getting butt hurt over jokes and people just having fun and being sarcastic in good taste.   Example:   Now I'm a DIG fangirl myself, along with pretty much every other competitive team in SMITE, but when it comes to something like this... over something so small... maybe you need to take a step back and eat a chicken wing and cover your body in watermelon sauce.   We all need to just relax, have fun and continuing to grow this game, but when you have "pro" players acting like children and sending fans to bash on other "pro" players, there needs to be a line drawn and something done about it. It's sad that someone like me ( a scum chickened watermelon fangirl ) has to post something like this. But come on now... this is whack.
I live out of town, about an hour walk, I recently rolled my car and have no transport other than to and from work, I have only a few friends since I moved to a new province a year ago and have had transportation issues.   The only people I see are my co-workers (east indians hardly speak english) My dad, his wife, and my brother.   I got cheated on and lost my girlfriend of 3 years in the process of the move, and things have been pretty shitty for me in the past year altogether, I have made many self improvements and have tried my best to make my life as good as it can be but I am still so lonely.   I turned to facebook and world of warcraft but i feel so empty inside.   What to do....
I guess I should provide some context, so essentially I'm 17 and at uni, I know I'm young and all, but I honestly haven't had a proper friend of any sort for something like 10 years now. I always used to just tell myself that things would get better latter but it's just not working these days, I feel like I've run out of "latters." One of my main aims when I got to uni was to try and make some good friends, instead I meet some people who only ever talk to me if they need something, barring face to face contact, where they still don't normally talk to me. I realized this during these holidays since I have had one conversation with anyone from uni which only happened because I initiated it, and pretty quickly ended when they just didn't bother saying anything more. otherwise One person who I thought was a good friend has just asked me for help in things that he really could have done quicker himself.   I just don't get it, they hang out with each other yet they never want to be around me unless they need something, it makes me wonder at times if I'm to generous, since they nearly all owe me in various different ways for things I have done for them most of which I have offered to do without being asked. Yet, I can't just leave them because otherwise I would have absolutely no one to even pretend to hang out with, so I'm not really sure what to do. I tried playing rugby with my local club, which barring few annoying facts I enjoy, but even though the guys are friendly none of them make any effort to talk to me let alone hang out with me. I seem to be stuck in this state where people don't mind being friendly, and they don't try and drive me away, but I never get included in anything unless there is no option in it.   I should also maybe point out that I fear rejection quite a lot much more then most other things, I would far rather get beaten up (which to be fair happens on a regular basis since I play rugby with guys who are 30 sometimes 40+ kilos heavier then me), or get into a serious fight then have someone say no to me. This does make me practically incapable of actually asking people for anything at all, just in case, even when I think the answer might be yes, even in writing this it took me days to actually get around to even starting writing this, and all day with many restarts to actually get here. I already have enough things causing me to be depressed with out this continuous loneliness that I've been carrying around for too long now. It might be worth pointing out that the part (probably the main reason) I fear rejection so much is that I have a ton of self confidence issues for various reasons. If you want me to expand on anything here I'll answer questions.

I'm at priesthood session and TSM is going on and on about duty. The child in me is having the hardest time no laughing at the phrasing.   I haven't  heard a peep. The deacons in here have to be loving. He also keeps saying call of duty. Maybe he has been playing MW3 and it has been on his mind.
on another thread, a redditor posted a comment that it's not fair society should have to bear the medical costs associated with motorcycle crashes. his post was down voted to oblivion but I wanted to get this off my chest.   ok troll, I'll bite. lets talk about fair. my 21 year old son pays usurious insurance rates ... for his CAR ... because other under-25- year old males have demonstrated poor judgement. he's never been in a wreck, or had a ticket. is it fair that his rates are higher? yeah, probably ... that's how insurance works.   I worked my ass off in college, took crappy jobs, and served in the military. now I have a good job, and my taxes pay for various safety nets that are, in some cases, abused. is it fair that a person who can "earn" more living on the dole than they can working full time for minimum wage gets a subsidized apartment, health care, food, and still manages to pay for a pack of smokes and a six pack of beer a day? no, not really, but that's how society works.   as a society, we allow - and even underwrite - an astonishing variety of hazardous and unhealthful activities. government subsidies keep tobacco prices low. we tax alcohol sales with one hand, and subsidize corn, wheat, barley, and hops growers with the other.   fast food - and American chain - restaurants serve salty, fatty, high-calorie food in ridiculously large portions, and our health care dollars subsidize treatments for obesity, diabetes, heart problems, and other results of a sedentary, over-fed lifestyle. how many employers subsidize gym memberships, or smoking-cessation support? precious few.   so you suggest that I should surrender my fuel-efficient fun machine because I MIGHT incur healthcare costs that society will have to help pay for? because its not fair?   do you feel the same way about cell phones? we are approaching the point where the majority of accidents ... involving motorcycles, as well as cars ... are the result of distracted driving.   how about alcohol? leave aside the suffering and costs associated with alcoholism, including employment problems, family abuse, and long term illness and focus JUST on motor vehicle issues. how fair is it that a repeat drunk driver can continue to risk not just his life, but yours and mine as well?   you've picked a single activity - riding a motorcycle - and declared that its not fair that society bear the cost. I suggest that the very purpose of modern society is to share the costs associated with life choices.   i submit that to suggest that one group of people, who happen to enjoy an activity that you disapprove of, should stop doing what they enjoy so you don't have to pay for it, without similar restrictions on EVERY potentially costly activity ... that is the most unfair attitude of all.
Probable, but is anyone else getting the vibe we all might have twin cars with matching dents? What if we made it a country wide event to find your automotive twin and if you did (and it is legitament. Not you destroying a random car for no reason) then you got a special deal with the car dealership you purchased from for a brand new one.
So, this very good looking female wants me to come show her how to dance in the city I used to live in. The city is 2 hours away. She is hereditarily good looking. A solid 10/10 to the general population. Out of the blue one night, she contacts me and tells me how good of a dancer I am and she wants to learn. So I say I'll show her and drive up because "I miss my old town."   The only thing I'm worried about is trusting that her what we planned to do. I know what you all are thinking, but I don't want to drive up there and get mugged or something bad happening. As you can tell, I have anxiety sometimes. I just find it so perculiar and random for someone like her to want someone like me to do that for her. Maybe I'm just over thinking it?   All in all, I've only talked to her a couple times in school and she seems like a very sweet woman. I don't know her all to well. What would you guys do in a situation like this?
No power over anyone else on the bitcoin network   Are you serious?   The entity known as 'Satoshi' reportedly holds a million BTC's. That's 1/12th of the current available supply. If ever there was a potential whale, he is it.   Whilst I'm sure he's a very nice chap, we don't know for sure what his intentions are.
So you are saying it is fine to point out conditions someone cannot control but it isn't if they can change it.  Makes sense, it's alright to make fun of something you can't change but can't because someone doesn't change their lifestyle.
Fourteen years ago my dad bought me a relatively cheap Johnson acoustic guitar because I thought I was super seriously interested in learning to play. Needless to say...that never happened.   But now I'm a stay at home dad myself and I find myself with a lot of free time on my hands. I'd love to finally learn how to play for real, instead of being able to play a short tune or two from random popular songs.   My current knowledge/skill is virtually non-existent, so I'll be starting from the ground up. I've tried to get into learning many, many times before, but I've just not found the right resources that work for me. I'm fine with books, online videos, or things of that nature (despite having tried those methods before without much luck), but I'd love to hear if anyone has any good resources they could point me towards. Oh, and one-on-one guitar lessons aren't really an option.   So,
Personally I believe in getting the guitar you want. I started with a knock off Stratocaster. That's a learning guitar package that came with an amp for $300 aus but it never really felt right, so save a little more and get the one that feels right to you. I use a Kramer nite v myself and haven't looked back on spending the $700 for it. Rocksmith 2014 would be a better purchase as you can download the original songs as dlc as well as having a bigger range to play. Also I feel 2014 is easier to navigate and use. Buy it on steam then go to a local store that sells the realtone cable standalone to get the game as cheap as possible if you are lacking on funds.
I had a Christmas party, and I realized just how screwed up high schoolers can be even when they aren't drunk.   So, we have these specialty cupcakes, right? They're Mountain Dew flavor (actually they were really good) and I had two friends over before the party. One person that would be attending the party was a grade lower, and my two friends wanted to prank him. Hard. They found the red food dye in my cabinets and the cornsyrup in the pantry... You see where this was going.   So they gutted his cupcake and filled it, I mean completely stuffed it with this sweetened fake blood. We had to be absolutely careful that he was the one to get the cupcake, because we didn't want our other friends to get it. They took a little black pipe icing and wrote everyone's names on the cupcakes, and took the ones without names into the kitchen. It was going perfect.   After the party began, I realized that they forgot one persons name, and I was unable to fix it. When most everyone got around to grabbing a cupcake, there was only two left for three people. When the left-out person complained, we willed the other friend to give up his cupcake and we could get him a new one, but the younger kid had pranked the other himself by smashing his cupcake in his face. Long story short, the younger kid gave his cupcake to the friend without one.   The pure look of horror on my friends face when he bit into it and realized he had sticky red syrup running down his face and clothes was enough. Everyone else began laughing, and the poor kid snapped. He tasted how sweet it was, and I'm not joking when I say he ate every last drop. This kid was on a sugar high for the rest of the night.   After we went outside to hang around, he came up to me and asked if he could drop kick off my wall. I declined, and I thought that was it. Not even five minutes later, he's running at my neighbors fence, screaming "I AM THE SPIDER-MAN" and plants his foot directly in the middle of the fence. Two panels fall through and all 20 of us ran upstairs.
While not a coworker, I'm almost certain this guy was fired on nearly his first day of work serving me:   I went to order dinner at a local Carl's Jr. one afternoon on the way home from work.  I went to use my debit card, as usual, but it was not working quite right; for some reason they could only do credit charges for some reason that day, and not debit.   The cashier guy was very new, and seemed really nervous about a bunch of things.  I saw him fucking around pretty bad with the keypad when he went to manually enter the charge for the transaction or something, then he frantically ripped off a receipt and tried to discreetly throw it away.  He redid the transaction and I signed the paper...it looked normal and legit, and I took my copy.   No less than two minutes after I got home with my hamburger, the phone rang and it was my bank's automatic fraud system asking me to verify charges on my account.  WTF?  The system started to read off charges and then it read off a charge of somewhere in the neighborhood of ~$17,140.00 from Carl's Jr.  I was transferred to the fraud department and they deleted the charge... (like I had that kind of money anyway???)   Turns out the guy somehow fucked up the entry so bad that he charged me $17,140 for a hamburger instead of $7.14, and didn't correctly cancel the thing...he just panicked.  I was surprised you could even do that on a fast food credit card machine..   Never saw him working after that single day.
I'm age 21 and female by the way. This evening I was talking to my boyfriend (23) when he remarked that "I should take better care of myself" and "to be a more positive person." I'm completely stumped by what he had to say, but also acknowledge that perhaps I can be a bit of  downer especially when I'm stressed out (and I've been very stressed these last few weeks). He said that I bring him down sometimes and that makes him not want to be around me, but I've also noticed that the longer we go without seeing one another (we usually see each other on the weekends only), the more easily I get stressed out. I feel like he helps center me quite a bit when things get difficult but now I feel hesitant to express myself to him.   I work a very busy full time job and am double majoring in school at the moment. I still manage to do my best to exercise and eat right, but sometimes the stress just gets to me and I get really bad headaches. He seems to take my headaches as an indicator that I am "letting myself go" and that I need to take action in some manner. He's on the kick of getting back in shape at the moment and asks me every day if I've been to the gym yet. I'm 5"5' and 125 lbs and my job is very physically demanding so I don't feel the need to go to the gym every single day. Plus earlier this week I went a little bit overboard and inflamed a minor over-use injury I've had in the past so I took a few days off. This pestering is also adding to my stress but I dare not say so as I may be coming off as "negative" again. I already refused to partake in his "bi-weekly progress pictures" due to my past with a decade-long battle with an eating disorder. Though fully recovered, I still avoid things that could unnecessarily trigger me in some way.   Overall, on the general day to day I find myself to be rather neutral in personality. I'm neither beaming with good will and positivity, but I also don't walk around saying how much I hate the world. I'm always encouraging him to do his best and I try my hardest to only think about the good incomes even though he doesn't see it. What are some things that I can do/change in order to be a more "positive" person? When I expressed confusion at what he meant, he could only say that "see, you're not even trying."
I have a few stories but here is the one that sticks out most in my mind. I had a friend (let's call her Karen) who became incredibly depressed after the man she "loved" (she'd talked to him but never really told him her feelings nor got to know the guy too well) had gotten with another friend of hers. Technically, I know there is some unspoken code of not getting with the object of your friend's affections, but since she had apparently never made a move in the 7 years she spent being his acquaintance, I really don't see too much wrong with it.   Anyways she asked to crash at my place for a while. Since she was a friend, I figured spending some time together and cheering her up wouldn't be too much trouble.   BITCH STAYED IN MY HOUSE FOR 6 FUCKING MONTHS AND WOULD NOT LEAVE.   Here is a list of things she did:   -Demanded pancakes at 12 midnight or she would cry. I love pancakes but after catering to her needs for a couple of weeks, it got annoying.   -Spooned me at night and told me I was "just his size." One of the most sleepless nights ever. She is/was also quite obese...so heavy, sweating bitch spooning.   -Insulted the food we had at home. I live in an Asian household but things like broccoli beef are not that foreign and when you're getting it for free, you need to stfu. If I lied and said I bought it from a restaurant though, she'd say it was the best stuff ever.   -Made me take her out for food since all the food in my house was apparently inedible. Since she was apparently broke and I had a job, I could buy everything. I expected to be paid back at least some of that...nope. She picked some expensive places too.   -Had all of us eat a month of del taco tacos. Think Supersize Me but not.   -I asked her if she could stay somewhere else. Then she told some of our mutual friends and basically ostracized me as a 'horrible friend.'   -Stole my bed during Finals Week even though she was off from her university and I had a final that determined 60% of my grade.   -Randomly had unprotected sex with an Indian dude on a beach. Then cried because it made her realize she still loved the other dude. Tried directing her to Planned Parenthood and got called a horrible friend and, once again, ostracized by other friends.   -Made weird voodoo dolls of the guy she liked. Tried saying they were mine when confronted. More ostracizing.   -Littered my car with Plan B pills and a bondage whip once. I shit you not.   -Broke some of my art supplies. Refused to replace them because they were just 'shoddily made'   -Would reply to every time I confided in her with "WELL I HAD IT WORSE."   -Drove my car into a ton of trashcans.   -Demanded I spend all my time with her. Spent some time with her an my ex then got yelled at for making her a third wheel when he and I hugged. I had to make excuses to do the simplest things, like going out to see other friends. If I took too long, she'd get the other mutual friends to yell at me for being horrible.   -Made up stories about my ex assaulting her though, when she told me it had happened, he had been standing next to me.   -Used my computer and registered a bunch of dumb shit to my email address.   -Told me false stories about her former friend who had gotten with the guy. Ended up clearing it up so now we're good friends. One of these was that she had some sort of cancer and the friend in question laughed at her. Turned out to be some sort of face pimple :/   -Made me drive a large number of miles to help her move things, to get food, etc. This would be hours of driving...so not just a quick commute.   -She made me drive 25 miles per hour on the freeway once to move her shit because she thought it helped when you were moving. Everyone was mad, including me, but at this point it seemed like I'd get lynched by her friend mob if I didn't. I know I may seem like a doormat at this point but I really didn't want to lose my friends anymore than I already did.   -Borrowed money from my ex, and immediately after our bad breakup, decided to ask me for the money he owed her and yelled at me to sell my car to pay her back.   -When I told her I couldn't pay it and that this was unfair as I'd been broken up just the day before, she sent me a wall of text on facebook telling me how we could never be friends and how I lost something amazing.   -Apparently had gotten a hold of my password for my email and proceeded to fuck everything up like a psycho ex-girlfriend on steroids. Email was linked to a bunch of shit. Unfriended a ton of people on facebook for no reason, emailed me a bunch of pseudo-breakup letters, declared to everyone I was an EXFRIEND and was like [this!]( all the time.   -TOLD EVERYONE THAT SHE NEVER STAYED WITH ME AND THAT I OWED HER MONEY AND HOW DARE I BE SUCH A HORRIBLE PERSON. Lost my friends at the time because of this but, in retrospect, they weren't really friends to begin with.
I had just left my friend's house on my motorbike, and maybe 50 metres after turning the corner, a random car failed to yield at a give way sign, going straight through, and i ran into the side of it. The car didn't stop, and i was left on the ground for other people to call an ambulance. Went to hospital, suffered permanent damage to my knee and shoulder (Helmet ftw) and the best part is, I have to pay for the damages to my bike, because they didn't stop.

The problem was competing visions. My wife and I had the same vision for the business when we started and we achieved it together. If it hadn't been for the fact that I wasn't comfortable doing the software development we'd never have sought a merger.   A business merger is like getting married to a stranger. You have no idea what the other people involved are like or what their real goals are. It's easy to overlook potential problems when everyone wants things to work out. It's not until afterwards when the masks come off that you see what the reality is.   Instead of sticking to the vision she and I had, I allowed myself to be swayed to a different vision for the business without her buy-in. After she was pushed out, the criticisms she raised about that new vision ended up being validated. I wound up hating the changes and spent years disliking my business partners and hating my job.   Three of four different visions later, and after over a decade of insanely hard work, my business partners and I finally found a business vision that we were able to work toward and eventually sell for a profit.   I know I'm speaking code here to keep from revealing too many details, but my wife had a degree in accounting and business management that would have made my life easier if she had remained involved. I never wanted her out, but I was too easily sold on the competing vision. We all should have listened to her input, because of the four of us, she was the only one who predicted what ended up happening.   I loved being in business with my wife and would do it again in a heartbeat. The trick for us was to divide responsibilities cleanly and keep a common vision of what the business needed to be.
So, I have this spot in my local small town, which we consist of about a total of 2000 people maybe. One of my favorite spots in the small town is the local cemetery. The reason I like smoking in my car there is because it is away from a lot of the town, and you can virtually hide anywhere in there and have no issues encountering people. Well yesterday I decided to go there to toke a little bit that I had, I only had a little keif that I ended up smoking and then put my bong away.   As I'm leaving the cemetery to pull out there is a local cop sitting right there, and he makes me exit in front of him, basically to pull me over. He did pull me over, and of course my driver side window doesn't work so I direct him to go to my passenger side which he obliges, and he arrives to the windows. He says, "The reason I pulled you over is we have recently been getting reports of a white car that has been in the cemetary quite a bit lately, and we're just trying to be made aware of what this person is doing there." I'm sitting here about shitting fucking bricks, cause it smells like weed, at least I can smell it but he doesn't say anything about it just continues to get the information he needs. I told him, the reason I'm in the cemetary is to visit my many different relatives etc.(which I do, but while I'm smoking lol...), he proceeds back to his car and checks my record, comes back and apologies to me saying that there is no problem that I am more than welcome to be at the cemetary at anytime and that he will let his other deputy know that there is no need to worry about me.   Ahh, so ents please blaze one up for me to the thought of a generally decent police officer that was out to help and do his job like he's supposed to and didn't make any big deal at all regarding my weed smoking! Toke on!
Hi PF, this is my first time posting here. I need some help on deciding on whether or not making this purchase is better for me financially or not.   Let me start by explaining my situation. I am a college student and I work 30 hours a week. My job requires me to drive to each clients house, and as a result I clock a lot more miles a year than most people do. I used google maps and calculated the miles I drive from home, to each clients house, and to school each week.   Each week I drive 350 miles just between work, home, and school. This is not including any driving outside of that. So I estimated that I drive another 50 miles a week for personal reasons. This brings my total to 400 miles a week, or 1600 miles a month.   Here's a breakdown of spending on my current vehicle, then projected spending on the vehicle I'm considering. Insurance is not included because I'm lucky enough to have my parents still take care of that on the family plan.   My current car is a 2001 Lexus LS430 with 132k miles, with an average of 16mpg. My payment is $198 a month and I owe $5000 still on the loan, which has a little over 2 years left on the loan. Looking at blue book values and the rates at which this car is being sold for, I would say I have at least $2,000 in equity in this car.   In Southern California, the average cost of gas per gallon is about $3.60. Driving 1600 miles a month at 16mpg, brings my gas expenses to $360 a month in my current car. So the total monthly expense of my car loan and gas payments is about $560.   The car I am looking at is a 2012 Volkswagon Golf TDI (diesel), with 60k miles and an average of 32mpg (at least I'd say, since most of my driving is highway). The price of the car is $16000. Taking $2,000 from the sale of the lexus and putting that as a down payment, I estimate my payment of a $14,000 loan for 60 months at a rate of just under 2% from my credit union would be $260. With the mpg being twice as much as my current car, the monthly gas expense would only be $180. By my math, the total monthly cost of this car would be $440.   To me, this move seems like It would end up saving me a lot of money per month on gas, despite the higher loan payment. I just want to know if I'm missing anything in my calculations here. Like I said, my insurance is paid for, but even still I know the insurance on the 4 cyl VW is less than the 8cyl Lexus, and parts and service are going to be cheaper on the VW. Edit: I forgot to mention that I do almost all of my maintenance on my cars. Brakes, rotors, oil changes, suspension etc. The only cost to me for these things is parts.
I don't know what pickaxe is -- but if you don't know object oriented programming, then you will end up with spaghetti code even if you learn the syntax of Java.   Furthermore, unless students all have the same exam dates (unlikely), you will need to implement some kind of database to register users -- or some method of keeping track of who is using the app. So you might need database experience as well.   Then on top of learning the intricacies of Java and OOP, you will also need to learn how to program a GUI with Java. And then you need to learn the android framework, which takes some time as well.
I've spent a lot of my life thus far thinking I'd never find something I enjoy, and I'd just end up doing something I hate like so many people do. I've recently been trying to 'find my calling', I've never really had any aspirations or dreams or goals so it's been a pretty difficult process.   The only things I am passionate about is reading and writing, but I'm not delusional enough to believe I'd ever be able to make a living by writing, so I've been thinking more along the books angle. The main thing I have been really thinking about a lot is library work and second to that is a general bookstore clerk. I expect working in retail for books would be similar to working in retail for most things, but obviously you'd need a fairly extensive knowledge on a wide range of books, which I do, but I haven't the faintest what kind of path I'd need to take for library work. Googling has more or less come back with 'do a librarian degree' and 'become a library assistant' and I'm not entirely sure how I'd go about either of those.   So my questions are as follows:     Are there more job opportunities in working with books that those I mentioned?   What sort of qualifications do [UK based] book stores ask for?   What kinds of things should I mention in my CV to get the attention of book based employers?   What qualifications and degrees are require or preferred when applying for a library position, and how would I go about acquiring these? (I currently have Key Skills 3 in English, and passed two years of Creative Writing at University level. GCSEs aren't brilliant, mostly at C level and I'm hoping to retake them.)   How would I go the 'assistant' route in a library, would it be via apprenticeship, or do I just apply and try to convince them that I'm worthy of the position?     Thank you for taking the time to read my long rambling post, I really hope there'll be someone out there with some advice on where I go from here.
Was advised to post this here instead of r/relationships.   Hey, Reddit!   About 5 months ago I met this girl and we hit it off right away. She had a boyfriend at the time so I never pushed the issue but now we are both single and we get along great. She is 23/f and I am a 24/m. I've hung out with her only a handful of times through mutual friends and we hit it off each time and usually hang out together the whole night. The last two times we hung out, we really hit it off and she spent the night at my place.   Anyway, I like to do real romantic things when I'm interested in a girl and while browsing the Rob Thomas AMA the other day, I met another redditor from my town and he's a Certified Flight Intructor and said that he could take us up and get us behind the controls. So after chatting with him for a bit, I thought this would be a great date idea.   Things to consider: We get along well when we hang out. We have been intimate. As of right now, we're still juts friends. She's been sheltered her whole life and has never really done anything adventurous/traveled. I have traveled extensively and lived a crazy college life and we chat about that sometimes (don't know if that's relevant).   Anyway, do you guys think that this would be a kind of cool date idea since not many people can say "oh this guy took me flying one time" and also it's something completely new to her.   Or do you guys think it's a bit over the top. She asked me to hang out this Friday and I told her that we're going on a secret mission. She has no idea.   Thoughts?! And thanks in advance
I don't understand. Are you still saying this account is controlled by Drooperdoo? Because it's not. I don't know how I could make that any clearer. I did not post that. I have only posted things under name123000. Is there still not enough proof for you or what?   Drooperdoo's last comment was the one I responded to because I agreed with it. You blew it off with a "
I'd get her one on a non-birthday situation. Just spur of the moment. That way you're not trying to convert her on a day she might be expecting a little more attention to what she already wants. It could come across a little self-centered, despite being a gift.
I'm pretty much done with 2k now. With the stupid teammate AI, double team cheese, and insane CPU in HoF, unless I go off for statlines close to 50/10/15/5/5 my team ends up losing. I want to be the first option, don't get me wrong, but when I need to score literally every possesion, that's when I start complaining. I've tried both default and simulation on HoF, but both piss me off equally and I don't want to make the game easier because then I'll just go off for 60 a game, and that gets boring.   &nbsp;
So there's this guy who I think is interested in me, and we are both looking for the same thing: nothing serious, just someone to talk to and be intimate with.   He is literally the hottest man I've ever seen in person. If I were to post a picture of him, I would ruin all of your panties. He's that hot. I'm genuinely confused as to why he's never pursued a career in modeling.   His personality is not quite as attractive. Don't get me wrong, he's nice and funny, but he's a little over-the top confident, kind of obnoxious, knows how hot he is. Also, I'm pretty sure we have conflicting political and religious views (he seems like a conservative Christian, I am a liberal agnostic). I would care a lot more about those things if I were looking for a boyfriend, or something long-term.   He usually goes for really hot women. I've seen pictures of him and some other girls, they're all very beautiful. I'm really at a loss for why he might be showing interest in me.   The problem is that I am overweight. Not  fat , and not ugly, but just technically overweight. This combined with the fact that I only look cute in certain lights/angles, I'm feeling like this is maybe not such a good idea.   I'm on a diet, and it's been working pretty well so far, but I'm not nearly where I want to be yet. I'm almost tempted to shut this mini-relationship down before we start sleeping together and he sees me naked. At least until I shed 30 pounds, which could be months from now.   Just talking to him makes me nervous. I didn't even realize people actually get so sweaty just from a social interaction, but it happens every time without fail. I always say something cringy or trip over my words. But now he's possibly going to ask me to sleep with him. This idea is so incredibly intimidating, I don't even know what to do.
A good friend of mine (23F) asked me to have a conversation about sex with her tomorrow afternoon.  She says she needs to know "more than anatomy and abstinence", but I assume she does know the basic P -> V mechanic as well (although maybe not?).   She is very inexperienced with the opposite sex - she's never even held hands with a romantic interest before. She was raised in a very traditional household, although she is the rare person who is even more conservative than her family.   It may be that she has some specific questions and I'm overthinking things, but if she is as un-informed as I fear she might be, I may end up directing the conversation. As it is, the topics I feel like I really need to cover are:     PIV is how babies are made (hopefully unnecessary)     Everyone should masturbate     Consent/how-do-you-know-if-you-are-ready     Safe sex (a: safe from pregnancy, b: safe from disease)       What am I missing? I am worried that I will overwhelm her, or gross her out. Honestly I can't imagine that she will be OK masturbating but I really think it's key to understanding sexual pleasure. I know it's a little strange because she is rather old for this type of conversation, but she is a really good friend and I do want to help.
So I had been with my now ex fiance for really almost 3 years.  The back story is pretty simple she has two children from a previous marriage.  The kids are both older now 11 & 9 and I get along with them just fine.  In fact they are both good kids and I feel very bad for them in all of this because they are completely innocent.   Now while I like her kids here is the issue, their Father is very heavily involved in their lives (which is great as a father should be involved) and believe it or not her ex is not even a problem here.  He is re-married and while he and I don't go drinking beer or anything together we are cordial when we see each other.  I didn't meet her kids till about 4-5 months after we got together because she was protective of them and didn't want them to get to know someone until she thought it was going to be long term.  Again, no problem.  I completely understood and still do.   Since they are already older, have a deep relationship with their Dad and well their Mother and I aren't even Married they just simply call me by my name.  Again, I understand.  I'm not their Dad so I get it.   When she and I got together as we were getting closer and started talking about the future and all I told her that I really wanted children of my own.  I am an only child, my parents are both still alive and in great health and they both wanted grandchildren.  (side note her kids have met my parents once and that was only because I basically whined till she did it).   But while my parents want grandchildren the main person was me, I want a child.  I know as a guy I'm not supposed to care about that but I think I will be a hell of a Dad.   Anyway she was all gung ho and even once told me that she and I would make a beautiful baby together.  We get engaged and our wedding was scheduled for this July.   Out of the blue early last week she tells me that she needs to talk to me.  She then lays it on me that her OB/GYN and her have scheduled an out patient surgery for the last week of April for her to have a Tubal Ligation.  My first reaction was to ask what was wrong because I wasn't sure if she had some form of female problem or what.  No she said she had been thinking about it and decided that she was to old to have any more children and that the other two were just now getting to the age where she felt like she had some freedom and did not want to start over.   Needless to say my initial reaction was to be stunned, in fact I didn't say a word to her.  Then I just turned around and walked away.  She tried calling me but I ignored it and had to just get away from her and think.   I went back to her house later that night.  I just told her that I understand her point of view and can appreciate what she is saying but it did not change my desire to have a child.  If she had a medical reason or one of us couldn't have a child then I wouldn't even think twice about it.  But since she unilaterally made a decision that impacts both of us I was forced to reconsider my proposal to her and that while I love her I am not willing to continue on.   She lost her shit.  I mean she went through every emotion you can imagine from screaming at me, crying, begging, throwing a book at me (literally) and ultimately collapsing into a ball on the floor crying.  Look I felt like shit but wasn't budging off of it and split.   Well as the week has gone on I have been berated by her family and all of our friends.  Apparently I am the Devil now to everyone.  I have been harassed at work by her Sister and told by some of our friends (who were my friends before they were hers) not to talk to them anymore.   Yes I understand it is her body and her life and she has every right in the world to have this procedure and not have any more children.   But my problem is she didn't even talk to me about this and I'm sorry but this does in my opinion make a difference in not only her life but mine as well.  She is denying me the right to have children if I would have stayed with her.  I mean her kids are older and I'll never have a parental relationship with them so I will never have the experience of ever being anything other than a babysitter.   If she would have at least talked to me and told me this I could have spared both of us this misery.  Also don't forget she told me she wanted to have a baby with me.   I guess what I'm coming on here to ask people am I totally selfish and wrong for wanting a child of my own and breaking things off with her because of this?  My friends and her family sure think I'm wrong.
So I decided to give online dating a try. Sought out this subreddit and read the dos and don'ts. I set up my profile to be I think a nice balance of interesting but not long. I'm also abroad for the summer so I thought it'd be nice that even if I don't connect with someone we can at least be friends or I'll get a nice cultural exchange.   I sent out about 10 messages, 3 responses in the morning. Score! The last one seemed a bit suspicious as she messaged me first.  We talked on skype with voice then video chat. She wanted to meet up with friends but I said I can't bring friends on short notice. So we agree to meet at the train station (public place) and go for a walk (public and safe).   We sit down and eat, she knows the area. Is a local. Mentions while we were walking that she needs her space when walking with guys so I give her an extra two feet. No big deal, I get it. We talk about interests, music, work, movies, and maybe later we can get some karaoke. I offer to pay for the meal, its a cheap 10 dollar meal we can split together. She agrees.   Conversation seems okay, no real pauses except when she pulls out her phone and texts (kind of bothers me, I mention that on my profile question somewhere). I got to throw away the tray for both of us and turn around and she's gone. Like no where in sight. I look around for a minute, walk to both exits and look out. Wait 5 minutes out front and just think I must've set off some alarm or she just wasn't into me.   Distraught I walk home to the station and text her that I'm sorry if I did anything and good luck on her job search (she talked about that quite a bit). She calls me and says that I ditched her. That she went to the bathroom and when she got out I was gone. I told her I must've misheard her and that I'm sorry. (really I WOULD'VE heard her say if she went, she didn't). She says that leaving her was a strange thing and that makes her nervous and that I acted weird.   This kinda killed me, I don't mind rejection. I just want the common decency of a good-bye. Or maybe leaving then texting that it doesn't work. Be an adult.
Imho every second player has a smurf so wouldn't it be a nice addition to the account system of League? It may also solve some account selling problems (which clearly exist), if it could be bound with your IP address instantly. I don't know if this is repost or a too difficult work for Riot, it just came to my mind when I created a smurf and had to create another e-mail, which is really annoying imo.   Edit1: Maybe give a 4 IP-Boost if you associate your smurf to your account so people actually consider doing this (limit it to 1-2)
Up-vote for you! I agree the OP's site just comes across poorly even after considering the sarcastic/joking context. It feels like it was put together by a frustrated high-school code monkey who has no understanding of the design process or client management in general.   I say this as for the last 3 years I've been running a design shop and we've had no issues with telling a client "NO". As a result we've avoided working on crap like this. Does it hurt the wallet from time to time? Sure does, especially when starting out. But it does allows us to work on worthwhile projects that we truly enjoy while saving us from loosing our minds and lowering our standards. Ask yourself this if you can't show off a project when you're finished...what's the point?   Perhaps I'm just one of the last hold-outs, but it seems many in this sub-reddit have the mentality of "whore yourself out to client approval" and it disgusts me as it gives clients the mentality that they're always right. (hint: they're not!).   Anyone can call themselves a designer or developer, but to really be one takes hard work. If you can't manage your clients, you're going to have a bad time and end up with sites looking like this.
Absolute boner-killer.  Thanks, I guess.  I didn't want to jerk it to 1995 Pamela Anderson tonight.
Not sure why you're being downvoted, you are right in that the money comes from somewhere.   The biggest lie however is that the US doesn't have socialized medicine. It clearly does for those who are over 65 although there are many parts excluded for no particular reason.   The crazy thing is that medicare costs the US taxpayer more per person to only insure those who are 65 plus vs the universal care provided in the UK. This is because of cost control implemented by the NHS where everything from prescription drugs to the cost of medical school are controlled by the government, not to mention the NHS covers the medical negligence insurance which I understand in the US is ridiculous.   The UK also does not have high taxes really, especially for entrepreneurs who can opt to have their salary paid as dividends which significantly reduces the tax and opt out of nearly all national insurance taxes (social security).   Based on an average salary of $55,000 in the UK you are paying $813 per week (inc tax and NI). In the US you would be paying $807 to the federal government (income tax plus SS) per week. Then in the US you need to factor in state taxes which ofc are too hard to go into as some states have none but I suspect in 95% of the US it would be more than $5/week, New York would be $53/week with no dependents. You then need to factor in health insurance which from looking at average quotes that's at least $57/week not to mention if you get sick you are also looking at co-pay and co-insurance especially on medication and if something requiring emergency surgery even if you get taken to the right hospital $3,000 in network and a small fortune if the "wallet biopsy" causes you to be taken to the wrong hospital. So lets be conservative and say you'll average $10/week out of pocket for healthcare in your working life.   So there is a quick but fairly reasonable comparison: In the US you pay  $927 per week in personal income tax, SS contributions and health insurance. You are also at risk of going bankrupt if coverage is denied.   In the UK you pay $813 per week in personal income tax, NI contributions and health coverage which can't be denied. You are paying $5,928 less in tax and yet you get the NHS, a fairly comprehensive social safety net and many other socialized institutions like not having private student loans charging commercial interest rates and better infrastructure (small land mass is also largely to thank for this one).   In the US you don't have any of that dirty socialism, you get your own room if hospitalized (that's pretty sweet) and you can blow up the world 4 or 5 times over compared to the UK which only has enough nukes to ruin the world once, amateurs.
you can actually make this happen deliberately on any battery-powered thing. it's one of the simpler examples of "circuit bending," which is basically the art of intentional malfunction manipulation. you simply put a potentiometer* between the positive end of the batteries and the place where the power goes into the main circuit board. to figure out how strong of a potentiometer to use, just experiment - 5K pot doesn't do much? go up to 10K, or 50K. If, when you turn the knob, the device is off most of the time, and then springs to life at the very extreme towards zero, you need a knob with less resistance.   find the right one, solder it into place, drill a hole (preferably right in the middle of the baby's head), mount the knob, and boom! controllable creeper baby. so much creepier because you can go up to the high pitch and back down!   *a knob, in layman's terms, but people who build these things call the top that goes on it the knob. the actual part that controls the flow of electricity and has a small turning part coming out of the top is a potentiometer, or pot. potentiometers control the flow of electricity; they apply variable resistance to a path that goes through them. usually, they apply resistance on a scale from 0 to X, where X is their rating. It could be anything from 5,000 (5K) ohms to a million or more. turning the knob moves between the extremes.
There's this misconception about human relationships which a lot of people seem to hold: that human relationships are in a sense permanent.  I think of human beings as constantly mentally evolving organisms, and your expereince tends to shape this.  This means that you are really not the same person even after the period of a year or two in some respects, and your friendships probably will change to reflect this.   You simply outgrow certain friendships sometimes.  You can try to prevent this (some people hold on way too long to friendships and relationships and end up miserable), but why?  It seems like a pretty natural component of life and growth.   Aside from growing apart, though, your meaningful friendships have quite an impact on your life.  I recently had to end a friendship I've had since high school because we had become different people, and I could no longer put up with his unending commitment to cynicism, and seeing everything in the worst possible light.  It was emotionally affecting me in a bad way, so I moved on.  I've since made new friends who are more positive, and consequently have had a better influence on my life.   Acquaintances are interchangeable; they're not really friends.  To qualify as a friend you have to establish some deeper connection with a person.
After I get killed in Lopatino my squad manage to capture my killer. The ensuing interrogation ends up much more spiritual than anyone had anticipated.
I'm 31.  Three things happen as you get older:     Your body slows down .  Your energy levels are a little lower each year until eventually you die of old age.  I, for example, never had to exercise to stay thin before.  It just happened all the time.  Incredibly, immediately after my 30th birthday I started gaining fat.  Fast.  Now if I don't do cardio almost every day, it just keep building up.  Weird, but there you go.     You get smarter .  Your brain continues to develop until you're about 25, and beyond that it's all just new knowledge being stored.  As a result of interacting with different types of cultures and responsibilities, over time your model for "what will happen if I do X" gets richer and richer and more complex.  You can see a bigger chunk of the game board at once, simply through practice, and you also see levels of the game that you didn't see before, through exposure and once again through the efficiency of practice.  Amazingly, the average human has to live for about 25 years before they realize that  people older than them are smarter than them .  Just like you know more than your little brother who's 12, I know more than you.  So does  every adult around you  (except the really stupid ones).     Your attitude changes .  Because you have been at the top and the bottom multiple times, you don't worry so much about whether you fall or climb each day.  It's a cycle.  It's like the first time you go down a ski slope, maybe you're really worried about which route to take because if you take route A you miss route B, but if you take route B you miss route A.  That's what teenage life is like:  all these choices about "who you're going to be" and bullshit like that.  Adults around you (especially high school teachers and counselors) will tell you that "you gotta decide who you're going to be".  The reality is you get to go down the slopes many, many times.  You can take the Goofy Rooster this time, ride the lift, and take the Jar of Marbles the second time.  You can be a punk, then a hipster, then a buddhist monk, then a securities trader, then a fishing instructor.       So that's one thing.  There are some adults who are gonna give you stupid advice.  For the most part, those adults can be found in high schools where the reason they're giving bad advice is because  their job is on the line and they can get fired for giving you "unauthorized" advice .   But the majority of adults are not trapped into a professional scheme that forces them to be lame.  The majority of adults  have  been through the shit you've been through, and know how to get through it, and have probably beaten it four or five times by now, and will give you solid gold advice.  Especially the grey-haired ones.   I was lucky.  My generation of grey-haired people fought in WW2.  They were some tough mother fuckers, and basically have their heads screwed on pretty tight (with proper lubricant to allow rotation of course, and always using a torque wrench to avoid over-tightening).   Your generation of grey-haired people are gonna be hippies and vietnam vets (big overlap here).  They participated in the civil rights movement back when the only way to communicate socially was to get together in the same place and use microphones.  If someone walked away from that gathering, they were  off the map  until they showed up somewhere with a phone.  Your generation of grey-haired people got into some crazy, crazy shit (not that being in a firefight in the south pacific wasn't batshit crazy).  But culturally, they've got a bigger perspective on how the individual relates to the society, and how society can be modified.   So my generation of grey-haired people has been full of advice on temperament, how to chill, how to get through tough spots emotionally, how to maintain a vehicle, how to prep for a date.   Your generation of grey-haired people will probably have a different skillset.  But they will be masters of it.  All of them.  Think about how much better at things you are now than you were when you were twelve.  That's five years.  These people have gotten ten or twelve of those under their belts, and their eyes have been open the whole time.
I looked for help for translating what my native Korean girlfriend said in /r/Korean but it turned out to not be of much help.   It's my last resort to post it to this subreddit since it's purpose is to discuss whats going on in Korea rather than the language itself.   To fill you all in on the situation, me and my girlfriend of some time finally got in our first argument the other day and I'm now getting the classic silent treatment to allow me to reflect on how I made her mad I guess. While every person is different, I'm not familiar enough with Korea and have not dated enough Korean girls to know what is cultural and what is a character trait of someone. To expats who have managed to really piss off their Korean SO's, how did you handle it and how did they?   Since we have argued there has been no speaking expect for her saying this the other day;   "곰곰..맘칫맘칫 ?_? "   If someone could translate it for me that would be appreciated.
I (21F) am an assistant manager of a pizza place where all of the employees are really friendly with each other. A lot of us hang out outside of work so it's not unusual for us to make jokes and stuff at work. We got a new guy (28M) "Andrew" a few weeks ago who has even taking things a little too far. Flirting with some of the girls, making comments about my boyfriend, and things started to get physical (touching my arm or sides)   I told my boyfriend (21M) all about this because I tell him everything and wouldn't want to lie by omission. I also shared with him that I was seriously sexually harassed at another job before this one. He was my boss and would unhook my bra and try to kiss me. I never said anything to anyone about it. My boyfriend told me me I needed to confront "Andrew". I agreed because I knew he was right but I am very bad at confrontation and was nervous.   The next day instead of clearly telling "Andrew" the behavior needed to stop I just ignored him all day when he tried to talk to me because I thought that would make it stop. When my boyfriend asked about how it went I told him and he was upset. He said I didn't do enough. I later went back and firmly told Andrew to stop. And he apologized. But to my boyfriend it was a little too late.   We went almost a whole day and a half without talking because of our work schedules and he wanted to talk face to face about it. When we met up he said it broke his trust that I didn't handle this and that maybe I'm not ready for a relationship. He said he loves me but doesn't know how to get past this. He doesn't want me to even work with Andrew anymore. I'm leaving to join the Air Force in a month. Me and my boyfriend we're going to try and make it work with long distance for a little while and then hopefully he would move to be with me but now my boyfriend is reconsidering the whole thing.   I don't know what to do. We are trying to make it work but I don't know how to rebuild his trust in me.
So for the past few months I have been feeling there has been a major change in my relationship with my boyfriend. We've been together for almost 5 and a half years and we rarely fight. But lately I've just been feeling like there is something missing.   I'll start with a few months ago, I was having some health problems. Nothing too serious but I was getting pretty bad anxiety attacks, felt depressed. Basically just felt like there has been something wrong with me, health wise. But every time I would try to talk to my boyfriend about it he would kind of laugh it off or act like I was over reacting. Eventually I just stopped talking to him about it because I got the feeling it made him uncomfortable and that's why he was standoffish about it. I understood because he's never been the "pour your heart out" type of guy.   After a few visits with the doctor I find out I have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Once again I try to talk to him about it, but he laughs it off as though it's no big deal. It pisses me off but I move on.   But ever since the diagnosis I've been getting more and more irritated with him. I want to talk about our relationship, he blows me off or cuts the conversation short. I want to spend time with him, he's busy doing other things.   For example I wanted to spend the weekend with him at my parent's house because they're out of town and I'm watching the house for them. Friday night he didn't want to come over because he was too busy. I'm still not even sure what he was doing. And Saturday night he was watching the fight so he didn't want to.   Tonight I told him we need to talk, he said he agreed but was tired and wanted to go to sleep to rest up for a 5K he's running in the morning. These are just the most recent things but for the past couple months it's felt like it's just always been  something . He can't spend time with me because he's always busy with something else. I've never asked him for much emotional support because I consider myself a pretty independent person and neither of us are big into talking about our feelings. But lately I've just been wanting more support from him and he's knows I'm going through some stuff (health and family wise) and I just feel like he's not there for me.   I don't want to throw away a 5 year relationship like this because I love him but I don't know what else to do. I want to understand why he's acting like this so I can work on fixing it but he just won't talk to me.
I don't have a swiss bank account, but I have an offshore bank account.   Why? Two reasons. One is that I lived overseas.  A distant second is that my best friends father was an attorney specializing in taxes.  He explained that when then government comes for you, they will freeze your accounts.  Basically preventing you from mounting a legal defense.  Of course their contention is that it's illegal money. Unfortunately, you have to prove it first and then wait an ungodly time for them to give you access back if at all.   And that's if you win.   So I have a small amount of money in an offshore account. Not much, but enough that if anything happened to my accounts in the U.S., I'd have at least a small amount to afford help.   I report that every single year on my taxes.  It's a fucking nightmare because I used that same account to help a startup eco tour, (micro loan)  so i'm listed as a business entity and subjected to ridiculous amounts of scrutiny and hoops to jump through.   My wife is Canadian and we have small accounts there as well. Nothing more than $500.   The problem is that our government is making it so that foreign banks don't want to bother even dealing with U.S. citizens.  The entire presumption is that everyone is doing illegal things.  Sure some are, but the ones doing the big avoiding taxes have enough money and time that Uncle Sam isn't pursuing them, so they hassle peace corps volunteers with $500 sitting in some account in Moldova.
Seriously, bitches love virgins!  More seriously, I'm in the south and thought this was universal.  There's too many reasons to say why a girl might like a virgin.  Plays easily into her domination fantasy, thinks its sexy that she'll be teaching/showing, etc, but above all I think some are excited by the fact you don't have any prior experience so they can do ALL the things, and you won't have anything to compare it to or judge them by, so its no worries.  Also it's a win for you cuz shes gonna show you the best time she can manage - after all, she's setting the bar; she is the one you will be judging OTHER girls by now, at least for a while.
In conversations online and f2f I occasionally get nonanswers to questions. Sometimes the person is refusing to answer, but sometimes I can tell the person has missed my point entirely.   Interpersonal skills normally dictate what should be done in most situations, but in the interest of efficiency, when a tangible record of the question is left behind - such as here on Reddit - yet the answer shows unmistakable signs the respondent either hasn't read the question or has misconstrued my point in a rather elementary way, should I just ignore the response as irrelevant, or is it really worth my time straightening him out?     For example, if I ask, "Should I blanch garlic before peeling it, or is there a quicker way to do it?"   and the answer is "Blanching is supposed to be quick",   should I just ignore the comment   or should I say "Re-read the question. I wasn't asking about blanching but about peeling garlic."
so at about 8:30 i sipped down my first 4 0z of DXM i BSed online for about an hour then took my next 8 ozs I knew at this point that i was going full 4th platu and had embraced it.   While i was still functional i went down staires to wish my grandparents a good night.  my grandfather was exsausted and sleeping already in his arm chare a close family friend. his best friend had just died the day before.   I was wearing a robe tied  and a arazona theamed throw blanket like a shawl and my grandma said i looked like a hippy   bing slighty disasosiated already i giggled and playd the part saying something that sounded wise and talke with her for a while   i woke my grandpa and he got breakfast set for the next day as this was happenening my grandma and me reclined in to the couch in the sitting room and remininced about her sister wome i never met.  i felt like we were morining botther her sister and the family friend while we were talking.  sadly i can remember little of the actual conversation because the wheeles of winter where all ready pullingg and grinding me away in to disasosiation.   i huged my grandma for a few hours then went upstares and layed in to a slice of pumkin bread that i had baked the previous day (i am eating another slice as i type and it is delicius)   this was at my desk at some point i put on adventutre time and damn that show has gotten weirder and weirder lately i watched "water and earth" "time sandwich" "the vault" "love games" and "dungeon train"   for thoughs who whatch adventure time and have not watched them yet i am going to spoiler the shit out of them so be for warned   the first episode was one of finality and strenght anf truth in which finn and flame prinses sever their relationship permaninitly.  Whilst flame princess becomes flame king and enforces law of honesty on her subjects where truth is the base of her new government this was from the misinformation that finn and bubble gum gave here through out much of her relationship and life.   the second episode was one of magic man dickery and time manipulation  i remember little of it though it was hilarious if i rememebr corectly   the next one had great impact, fin was morning his loss of the relationship with fire princese and he joked about stuffing them feels in the vault and jake in his wise way told him to deal with some of that shiz.   it took him in to a past life where it is reveiled that he is a one armed female who has a firce large cat friend.  they befriend bubble gum during the founding of her empire yet steal her magic amulet   this link of past lives and ever presenese of bubble gum (whihc finn hilirususly mentions as the episode closes)  was a big mind blown moment to the ciclyic nature of life and how some things repeat yet other things stand above the sycle and direct the wheels as they move   the next episode was a silly one with finn needing to mary slime princess so that the evil other slim princess it was intresiting with the idea of lies and decite played with well.  i was really weirded out by the art in this one and it made my stomach giggle.   the next episode the dungone train was the best of this set in my opinion.  Lots of cool action and an importiant healing momoment for the relationshoip of finn and jake   it is amazing the lengths jakes brotherly love will go for finn, finn was traped in "dungone mode" (he is really good at dungone crawing) in a train dungione that wasgoing in a circle  beat one train car get loot go to the next forever style   and there was a fututre viewing ball that showed fin as an old gezzzer still in the train figthing and LOVEING IT   jake gets borde rather quickly and takes a break at a point   he then goes back to find fin and fin turns on him stealing jakes loot leaveing him locked in webing.   (finn is eaisily turnde from being  ritchious)   he then takes a peak at the ball of future finn seeing and he sees himself the same bad ass old dude but he notices falowing behind him still.... HIS BROTHER JAKEold and decrepid yet jake did not abandone hime.  fin relized the folly of his ways and released jake from web and apologized.   then jake tried to convince him t get off the train and finn was like nahh just a few more week.  jake tried to make a point about how it was adicting but finn showed the future finn ball and it was him and jake washing disshes.   finn needed the dungone to help heal from flame princese which jake new which was why they  where out in the first place.   and in the end it help heal the gap that had grown between them ovr that bit too   so at this point my grandma came in and wished me good night and   THIS IS WHERE THE TRIP  trully BEGINES   so the stage is set my mind is on cycles infinity time and morning   i then become an automatron doing menaingless things thinking about all this shit and it keeps repeating i end up right back where i begain again and again   i will be going to the bathroom and then everything will "shift" and i will be on my bed crossleged with my android tablet watching a youtube video that was the starting point crossleged on bed with android tablet youtube video  i would get up and do weird body movments then "shift" back in bed cross legged and android tablet again and again and again..... for hours... but this was all from about 12:50 to 1:30 because i alwasye checked the time when i restrted and though hours and lifetimes went by it was only a minute or less!   eventually i regained continutity of action and was just disasociated and cold soooo cold.  i was watching a lets play of dragon quest 5 by H C baily  and THAT game has so much cyclic elements to it too so i watched that for a few hours till the end of it and loved it cried over pixles and damn dragon quest is so crazy for its time.   i am still disasociated now still need to close my eyse OHH AND I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT ODIN IS THE GOD OF DISASOCIATIVES
A few months ago, my friend told me she wanted to write a political science research proposal so she could apply for a Master's degree at the university her husband attends. She's not a native English speaker and I'd like to think that academic writing is something I'm quite good at, so I offered to help her write it and edit it for her—something I've done with other people in the past.   Well, fast forward a few weeks, and to start off writing the first draft, she just basically talked at me and I typed. I figured it would help her to get something on the page so she could rewrite with some clarity. I also searched down some online guides to writing research proposals to help her out, and passed those on to her.   Well, she wrote quite a bit in accordance with the guides, but it was an absolute mess. I wasn't expecting her academic English to be perfect (which it wasn't), but more than that, it just wasn't formatted in a coherent way—ideas didn't logically follow from each other at all and it was really confusing. I talked to her about it and started just outright redrafting it myself, with her encouragement.   On Friday, though, I was trying to get my head around it and redraft, and realized that I shouldn't  have to  have a good understanding of the topic—I only offered to help write and then edit, but I was writing the whole damn thing by myself. I sent her a few messages, and the following conversation transpired:     me: Hey! Really sorry for being so slow. There are a lot of structural problems I'm having trouble with.   me: Also I've been thinking—maybe it would be a good idea, instead of applying for this semester, to instead apply next semester, and in the meanwhile focus on polishing your English writing skills?   me: I'm concerned at this point that with all the writing you'll have to do in grad school that you'll just get overwhelmed.   me: I'm super happy to help with that, of course   me: and if you really have your heart set on applying this semester we can definitely finish it on Sunday   me: but I'm concerned about what happens after you get accepted, since I know you'll have to do a LOT of writing.   her: That's why I'm applying for research student, so I have 6 monthes to practice writing and all   her: Then I can take classes and learb academicly   her: I don't need to pass any classes up to April. Untill April I just need to write a better proposal and pass an interview.   her: And then become a master student   me: Ahhh, I don't know how that works   me: At this point I'm kind of concerned about plagiarism though   her: I do wright the refrences   me: I mean right now I'm essentially writing the proposal   her: Oh I see. Ok.   her: You don't have to do it then   her: Just wish you said it earlier   me: I'm really sorry   me: I really want to help and I think I got too hung up on making it perfect and didn't think enough about how much I should be helping     I discovered on Instagram later that day that her grandma had died that morning so she was already having an awful day that I unwittingly contributed to. (I sent her my condolences.)   Yesterday she sent me a longish message, which you can see here with my very self-blamey response:     There is something I need to tell you. I absolutely know that you were doing me a favor from the beginning, you didn't owe me anything,and you were helping me out of the kindness of your heart.  I trusted you, I believed that you're gonna help me, that you were going to make my childish english into your beautiful academic English. I absolutely trusted you with something that big because I thought you knew how much it meant to me, after telling you over and over that this is the most important thing in my life right now! You didn't have to accept to help me, that would be perfectly fine, or you could still say that you're not gonna do it even in mid June, but telling me that you think it's not a good idea only a couple of days before the deadline, when I had no time to do anything or fix anything, or even come up with a plan B,that hurts! I just hope you know what you did to me.   me: I know. I'm really sorry. I completely understand if you hate me. This kind of thing is what I mean when I say I'm not good at social situations. I'm really really sorry.     She apparently hasn't read my response, which leads me to believe that she has blocked me.   I recognize my part in this whole mess. I should absolutely have brought up my concerns much earlier (although the proposal is actually due on the 31st, not in a couple days like she said). I realize that it's not an excuse, but I  am  a survivor of very long-term emotional abuse which has left me afraid to set boundaries (and which she knows about). I immediately went to self-blame, as you can see, but that's a knee-jerk reaction that I'm trying to work through.   I am sick to death of blaming myself for everything that goes wrong in my life. The responsible way to work through this seems to involve learning to distinguish when to accept responsibility for problems, rather than the easier response of just becoming defensive about everything. I would, consequently, like a neutral perspective on how much I really am at fault here. I'd also like any advice that people might offer on learning how to set boundaries, especially on things other people ask of me (and when I should speak up, since my default state is silence and assuming nobody wants to know what I think). I'd also like to know if people think this friendship can or should be salvaged.   Thanks for reading. Any help would be appreciated.
I failed a key class twice at my school, and I'm going to be suspended. I'm planning on taking an equivalent class at a college this summer. I will be able to reapply to my current school in 2013. I will have a year of no school. Any ideas on what I should do?   I'm 23 and I really should have an undergrad by now, but no. I am failing second year. I live with my mother because I go to school in the same city and it seems fiscally irresponsible to rent my own place just to "be independent" (for what it's worth, I think it would be a good idea to move out). I have never lived anywhere else. I have no social life and what friends I think I have are fading away. I feel like I have to claw and fight to have any sort of contact with them. I'm frustrated all to hell. Every girl I've fallen for has ended up having a boyfriend or moving to the interior by the time I got the guts to ask them out.  I have a part time minimum wage job as a barista. Working full time isn't exactly an option. I have no idea what career I want. I do play guitar, bass and a bit of piano for fun. I'd love to be a rockstar but I'm not very good.   I need a change in scenery. I've been banging my head on a wall for far too long. I have a year with nothing planned. What could I do to maybe motivate myself?   Edit: added work and hobby details
This article lists the 4 rules of gun ownership. I take the first 2 rules to mean "be prepared to kill anything in the general direction you point your weapon".   Moreover, I'm military. My security manager gave us a security briefing on year that started something along the lines of "If you think they're going to shoot you, kill them." I live by that too. That only applies to the video from OP.   Back to the scenario of the person being stomped: if you point your gun at someone committing an assault, there is no such thing as shooting to injure. You'd be better using intimidation tactics, which bearing in mind the first two rules, pose a high threat of killing the perpetrators. If you actively, purposefully discharge your firearm at them, you had better want them dead, because whether you want them to be or not, you have created a situation which can be out of your control regardless of training.   This does not mean you shouldn't train with any weapon you own.  Do it. If you carry, it could be the difference between life or death in an escalated situation.
Someone on this sub posted something remarkably similar almost a year ago. It did not receive a lot of attention.   I think the real question is...who still listens to the radio? /s   It's pretty simple to understand that Clear Channel is in the business of making money through ad revenue. They sandwich ads in between the 40-60 most popular songs (based on sales) of a genre of music. Wash, rinse, repeat for all of the other genres and collect megabucks.   103.9 has, as far as I can remember back, been a station that operates just like I mentioned. It IS 'New Music' to me on the random chance I hear WXEG broadcasting because I've never heard of the majority of the bands on there.
We've been together for a bit over six months now. Before I get the responses of : oh that's not that long, or you don't know each other yet. Please know that we've been through a lot that brought us together fast and I feel like we mesh.. Then again this could be because I consider him my  first real relationship (I mean real as in I do see him as marriage material). Recently he has moved in to my apartment and is going to be going to school/working full time. He had lost his job a few months ago (he had medical issues and couldn't work..In hospital for 1 month and 1 month of in house recovery). He understands that to live with me he has to pay half of everything.. Long story short the job he has now will not be sufficient enough to make the other half. He completes his school stuff in about 6 weeks and after that he'll be making a lot more money and knows he won't have an issue making the other half. The problem is, is now he wants to move out. He wants to stay together but says it's emasculating to make next to nothing to me and feel like he's "using" my generosity. He doesn't want to break up and I do get where he's coming from. I'm not sure if it is my anxiety or "girl thoughts", but I feel like we're going to drift apart. I'm not sure if this is his way of breaking things up without saying it.  I don't want him to leave, but at the same time I don't want him to live with me for free..   I feel like this means we are taking a step back but I'm not sure if that is just my own insecurities... Is this step signing a dead end to our relationship? any advice or input is appreciated. Thank you
I have had a problem with my anger for a long time now. One of my major problems has been not letting my anger out in healthy ways. I usually only let my anger out when I get really pissed off and I know this sounds dumb, but I feel like the incredible hulk when I get angry in that I feel like my body transforms into this monster that I can't control. My biggest problem with this is that I love the rush of pure energy my body gets when I feel like this. My most recent spike was today. I'm only 17 and I get into fights almost every time I talk with my sister. She was annoying me and we got into an altercation where I fought her. She said I needed to be put on Ritalin and called me a psychopath (Her minor in college is child psychology so she told me all about how messed up I am even though I have been seeing a therapist for about a month now) and this is where I really lost it. My father had to step between us and then I started to fight with him. I felt like I had "transformed" into this monster as I wrestled my father who I have never taken down before, to the ground. I could feel the rush of energy in my arms and hands as I saw my veins pulse. I got back up and looked at my sister and I felt like I was going to kill her. She ended up leaving the house because she had called my mother to pick her up ad she is staying at my mother's for the rest of the summer. This is probably the biggest spike of anger/energy/adrenaline I have ever had and it felt good, but the repercussions of my actions are what make my anger bad. I don't know what my anger stems from and I don't like it, but I love the energy I get from it. I don't know if it was my childhood, the way I was raised, not really having a dad growing up, or something else, but I have a problem and I want to fix it.
I logged all my characters together back in BC (second expansion) and i was up to like 263 days, before black temple or sunwell were even released, and i raided hardcore BT and sunwell. (That's 6312 hours..for less than half my wow playing career)   I continued to play a lot during wrath, and part of cataclysm.  My account isn't active or id go look at it again for laughs, i have my original account from vanilla still. Oh and i've spent around 500$~ on transfers and race/faction changes over the years, that's not even counting subscription cost
First and foremost, if you feel this is a better post for r/bodyweightfitness I apologize. I just wanted some ideas from that gaining perspective.   Stats: female, 21 years old. 5'3". 88 lbs.   I've always been smaller, but some anxiety issues over the years have made me develop some very poor eating habits and now I'm trying to rehab my body, if you could call it that, to eat normal sized meals and get the calories I need.   Food wise I'm just eating whatever. Lots of pasta, chicken, fish, sausage, green veggies and bananas and oranges. Sometimes for a snack ill have a peanut butter and Nutella sandwich. I have also started (2 days ago) drinking ensure plus 3 times a day. I can't do protein shakes because my stomach can't handle the volume and I just feel bloated and sick afterward. The ensures are, at the end of the day, giving me an extra 1050 calories and around 40 grams of protein. I drink one for breakfast, before bed, and after my workout.   I work 45 hours a week and go to school 12 hours a week. On top of that my boyfriend and I have 2 dogs so when I'm not at school or work I'm at home with them so they're not in their crates all day. If it weren't for my dogs I would go to the gym. But I love them and if I'm going to be a dog owner, I'm going to be a good one.   I've checked out the body weight fitness subreddit and I've just been doing the basics. Push ups, sit ups, planks, calve raises, squats sans weights, etc. however I don't know how I should be structuring this. I would like to be working out around 3 times a week. Should I just do as many reps as I can for each work out and be done with it?   I know it will be hard for me to gain muscle without weights, but at this point I'm just trying to put on weight so I can feel..... Healthy. I'm always tired. Also, I look like the spawn of skeletor.  My goal weight is 110. I'm trying to make the most out of my at home work outs because I don't want to get skinny fat. Cause that blows too.
My school has rolling chairs in our computer center.  A bunch of seniors (not me) dressed up in Mario character outfits.  There was a Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Toad and DK.  They raced around the school on the rolling chairs with bananas and paper shells colored green.  The goal was to avoid getting caught by the teachers and deans for as long as possible.  Whoever was caught last won.
As we all know, having high solo queue ranking doesn't mean anything about your prospects of becoming a pro player.   Yes, because all the pro players you see today were picked up when they were low ELO scrubs. /sarcasm   >Solution: Remove the challenger tier from solo queue and remove the cap on league points in Diamond 1, or change the challenger tier to allow an unlimited amount of people in solo queue.   DIAMOND 1 WOULD BE THE SAME THING AS CHALLENGER, THERE WOULD BE NO POINT. Holy shit. If you removed challenger there would be no way to see the top rankings of the ladder, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF RANKED PLAY.   >Challenger tier is useless in solo queue because it is meant to be a gateway for new players to go pro, but solo q is no indicator of your performance in the professional scene.   Basically Challenger is there to CLEARLY show who is at the top of Solo Q, if they happen to get picked up by a pro team then good for them.
So the take away is not that linked lists are bad, it is that they aren't good at the things they aren't good at.   Incorrect.  The take away IS linked lists are bad  and its worse then most people realize.   Vector is what you should be using by default. Unless you do a lot of insertions that isn't at the end, then deque is best. deque in
If she asked you to pay $5,000 to undergo a major surgery, after which you were unable to work for a month due to healing, had significant risks for infection and is often performed by under-par doctors and anestheseiologists leading to higher risk or complications and death during or after the procedure, which may leave excessive scarring or even a [Tori Spelling style botch]( and alter your look and personal sense of bodily self for life and would have to be re-done 15 years or so down the line going through all of the above once more for something completely superficial that she's pretty much fine with anyway- how would  you  feel.
When I built the factory room and farms and the secure-ish storage area, it was to help get the town going - to build roads and public infrastructure and not to provide a free resources to the other towns folk for their houses (although I didn't mind too much at the beginning because it attracted people here).   However, times have changed.   We now have people rich enough to buy half of the island, living here. While others are still too poor to own even iron armour. My guess is that taxation is just around the corner (specifically a property tax and after the next election). Again, this is all good and well providing it is fair. The aim of the tax seems to be twofold: to eliminate wastage of housing and to raise government funds.   'We don't want people buying houses and not using them' says Meat and I agree. However, if we have freely accessible factories and facilities, farms, animal pens, etc there is  no motivation to private citizens to fund the creation of these things . The upshot of this?  The state owns everything and almost everyone is poor , there is no motivation to produce anything, little income going to the state and fairly quickly we stagnate and are dominated by the closest wealthy town.   This can't be allowed to happen.   My solution is simple: privatisation.   The state leases the various plots and buildings (government owned) that have been set aside in the plan I made for crops, animal farming, the factory area , etc, etc to the highest bidder. It is then up to that bidder to decide what to do with it. Private land is taxed as planned, this is where people sell their wares (not out in the fields).   I will leave it to you to discuss whether or not this should include the massive public farm area and whether or not the lease holders should be allowed to remodel the areas or not. I propose we do make everything private and we allow private industry to do what they want (within reason - planning department). Should we still give away food? I would always give someone food if they asked me but that's different to letting people have free run of the land, to which I'm against.
I bought and used an HTC One X  to replace my S2, yet I'm typing this on my S2. IMHO, it is overall better than even the One X. It has everything a phone could have, and really doesn't lack anything.   The Galaxy Nexus was another phone considered as " best of 2011", but has a worse battery life, no microSD card slot, bad camera, but it will have every update until next fall (at least), while the S2 will just be getting Jelly Bean 4.1 sometime in 2013... the GNex has been on 4.2 for like a month already. Note that it's the international version (model number i9100) that will be getting JB, my friends with the "Skyrocket" (on Rogers... I'm in Canada, don't judge) still have " Gingerbread" (version 2.3, which is over 2 years old - and really like and feels it).
This has happened many different times. Hell, it was a central plot point in Beat Street. Writers fighting writers, artists fighting artists. I'm not surprised at all, and for the most part, Robbo acts like a little fucking kid. I always heard that you were supposed to solve this thing with a battle, not this tit for tat garbage. I guess it'd be hard for a stencil artist to battle a graff writer but hey, that's what I was taught.   As far as all these rules and shit they talk about go, I've never heard any of that. Team Robbo leads you to believe there's some sort of Street Artist Union and they're trying to take Banksy's union card. It's all nonsense if you ask me. Pieces die. It's the nature of the beast. I don't write over pieces I like, but that's where it ends. If I don't like your shit, I don't respect you. I don't care if you're my fuckin father, if you're wack, you're wack. I respect old school artists, I've learned from old school artists. I won't call em legends, but they certainly talk about their exploits in the good ole days of NYC train yards. If I came across their wack shit, though, I'd cover it up, snap a pic and show em.   That said, I don't think Robbo's piece was wack, I do think it was classic, and if it were me, I wouldn't've covered that shit up. It looked like there were plenty of better spots to hit up down there. And, shit, I didn't figure that Banksy was the type of guy to hit up something that was so out of the way. But hey, what do I know? I'm not that big of a fan of either of em, I feel like with all these people on Banksy's nuts, it doesn't leave a lot of room for alternative opinions and art forms. Hell, I know a girl who claimed she saw a Banksy stencil in Denton. I mean, fucking Banksy in Denton? It's not exactly the West Bank... I guess that's what I hate and like most about stencils. It could be anybody, it's so anonymous. There's no credit at all to be had. You're free and clear from cops, but you get no glory unless you're caught red handed.   The end is interesting, though. For one, dissing the chalk is meaningless. A medium is a medium, we don't choose the medium for the difficulty, or else we'd all be making our own paint out of piss and ash. The goldfish, though, those looked pretty well detailed, even if I wasn't up close to see em. I'm most interested to see how he got his head injuries. Was he jumped? Did he fall? I mean, that's rather suspect. wiki says he's out of ICU and making a steady recovery, so that's good. The name of his upcoming art gallery is kinda funny, though, "The Sell Out Tour".   As far as graffiti goes, I mean, we're breaking laws. Why the hell would I respect any self enforced graffiti laws? I only have my own personal morals. I don't rat. I don't start shit with people I respect. I don't bite. But, in the end, I guess if you have a whole team of people on your nuts about one stupid incident, you really have no choice but to battle or live in fear.
You know, I've been on this site long enough, and more importantly, I've been a participant of our modern culture long enough to notice something.  That is, I've been paying attention long enough to notice that the label "hipster" is not a label anyone will genuinely apply to himself.   It comes up often enough that someone is labeled one, whether it's a musician, artist, videomaker, writer, academic, etc.. It doesn't matter who, as long as they choose to drink pbr, smoke pall malls (or american spirits, depends on who you ask), go to small concerts, listen to less-than-mainstream or under-produced bands, grow a moustache, wear a bad sweater, support a local artist, or major in literature, or whatever.   Plenty of these things falling under the category of "hipster flags" apply to me, in fact, whoever I am.  Would I call myself a hipster? No, probably not, but I know a lot of people reading this probably would.  Yes, I own tight pants. Yes, I prefer PBR to coors light or budweiser.  Yes, I worked for my college radio station and enjoy new music, whether it was very popular or relatively unknown. The term probably wouldn't come up unless I said or did something "contrary" or "oppositional".  Like, for example, If I complained about the cultural bias of media outlets or websites.  Or, say, if I had personally arrived at a decision to drink fair-trade coffee because coffee farmers are all too often exploited.  Unfortunately, I'm wearing tight pants and I once mentioned that I dislike the taste of coors light, so therefore my opinion is invalid, and I'm actually a hypocrite.   It seems the great majority of criticism and fun had at the expense of "hipsters" is aimed at consumer choices.  Take for example the "hipster traps" some "artist" had set up in new york, which were fake bear traps with PBR, American Spirits, a colorful bike chain, etc. inside.  Nobody can say absolutely what the intention of the artist was, but it certainly did provide plenty of opportunity for people to tell stories of "douchey" people they've met who rode fixed gear bikes.  I may be wrong, but it seems to me like a lot of people completely missed the irony of the situation.  There are people who should be mocked and derided for their arbitrary, unimportant consumer choices, and the reason they should be denigrated is because their consumer choices are...bad?  Too oppositional?  Too self-conscious? Well, as opposed to...what, exactly?  Other, alternate consumer choices one would presumably make consciously?  How, exactly, is denigrating them for their personal and consumer choices any different than what they're ostensibly being criticized for?  Well, actually, it isn't.  And no, pointing out the irony of the juxtaposition is not "hip", it's honest.   But, really, it isn't the hating on PBR and fixed gear bikes that's a problem.  That's something as easily diffused as saying "PBR is cheap, and I don't mind the taste."  That should really be good enough.  The problem is that it's a straw man, a simple clique-ish device for exclusion, for placing people into "in" and "out" groups.  This is a pretty simple thing to gain some perspective on.  There is one way i've seen and liked, but maybe hasn't been taken far enough.  The situation is set up like this: We're us, we're sensible and thoughtful, they're them, they're irrational and ignorant.  Try that with a few identifiable "cultural" groups not intrinsically based on any central ideology, like so-called "hipsters".  Like, say, homosexuals.  Or the trans-gendered. Or illegal immigrants, or the mentally handicapped, or black people, or little people.  See, that doesn't sound so good, does it?   I'm not saying this is some grand cataclysmic matter of cultural identity on the scale of the civil rights movement, the gay rights movement, anti-muslim sentiment, or whatever.  What I am saying is that this is a worrying exclusionary cultural trend that, unfortunately, I don't think is going away anytime soon.  Except when used as a form of self-deprecation, the word "Hipster" is always used as an exclusionary term.  You're not one, because you drink PBR for a defensible reason, right? If you say you're not one, that makes you one, right?   And what else is the province of so-called "hipsters"?  Physical regions, colleges, and subjects of study come to mind.  Literature, Language, Art History, Communications, Media/Cinema Studies, Studio Art, Film, Music and Music Theory, Recording, Gender studies, Cultural studies in general, and so on.  The Arts and Humanities. They might not earn you the label on their own, but they'll certainly earn you some points in favor of it.  And the regions: Brooklyn, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Austin, Chicago, Nashville, and so on.  Having been to many of these places, It is my feeling that one thing they all have in common is a lively music and arts scene, and I think many people would agree with that.   And what's so "hip" about majoring in the arts and humanities in college?  Or, more broadly, about being involved in the arts or music?  Well, from the criticism I've seen, and the simple fact of the problem, the answer would be "money".  People are all too ready to declare so-called "hipsters" to be "trust-funders", rich spoiled kids who have the time and money to focus on arts and culture.  In fact, I'd say that this particular criticism is fairly true. It's not true that all liberal arts majors are trust-funders or that you must be one to be an artist or musician, but it is certainly the case that, with the current cost of education, one would need access to money or the evaporating scholarships to major in something that will not result in immediate high-paying employment upon graduation, the way engineering or accounting is supposed to.  And to continue in that discipline as a career after taking out 100,000 or more in loans to pay for that education?  That's even more difficult.  I don't think it's right, but I do agree that it seems a little impractical.   But you know what? I think arts and culture and the humanities are fucking important.  Not everybody agrees with this, but I don't think I have to mention the state of any countries where cultural diversity and free expression are non-existant to make the point  that they're important.  And to downplay their importance to the point where they're categorized as primarily the domain of spoiled, whiny, rich kids whose opinions are enslaved to pitchfork media and vice magazine is simple, base anti-intellectualism.    As much as I hate to say it, the liberal arts majors who refuse to defend the choice absolutely as worthwhile, because they're different, they have a good reason to do it,b because they're "not a hipster" are just as much to blame.  The effects of anti-intellectualism can be debated forever, but I'm not ever willing to suggest it's a good thing.   I'm not really talking about simple poking of fun here, I'm not that sensitive.  Doesn't bother me really, it isn't as if people are making racist jokes about blacks or muslims (in this case, anyway...).  In fact, it can be a good thing.  I'm all in favor of being aware and free to interpret cultural trends for the purpose of cultural awareness, whether it be anti-hipster humor, racist humor for the purpose of bringing attention to racism, homophobic humor for the purpose of bringing attention to homophobia, or whatever.  Disney characters with thick rimmed glasses saying annoying things? I don't think it's that funny or creative, but I don't mind it.  Having a "hipster" themed party in your dorm? Sure, why not, I'd go.  Calling that Reggie Watts guy a hipster sometimes because of his crazy hair and bad sweaters?  Fine.  But you better believe there would be A LOT more of that if he were white.  And no, it doesn't matter that he does it self-consciously, remember?  All of these things are fairly innocuous, but they are part of a larger and more troublesome cultural trend, a symptom, maybe.   I've tried to follow what one learns early on, in high school, grade school even.  That you shouldn't worry what other people think of you and your personal choices.  Well, when you're often given the choice between ignoring people who still act like the real world is divided up into cliques and defending the value of your human thoughts and feelings against criticisms based on your personal choices, one can see how it would be tempting to simply associate with people who look, think and act like yourself instead.   What is the point of this exactly? I don't know.  But doesn't everyone have the right and desire to level intellectually with their perceived detractors?
Ok Mr. Berfels, the doctor will be here soon to get you an inhaler for those asthma attacks!"  1 Hour later... asthma attack! 1/2 later doctor enters "Sorry I'm late I had another patient" (My mother)" Where were you, he had another attack!" His response was essentially "lol oops"
Fight everyone in the way of Allah and kill those who disbelieve in Allah."   You took that line out of context, these instructions are in times of war when Muslims are under physical and military-style attack.   Please read /u/FX114's comment again if you didn't understand it.   > "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them." "Allah" (Qur'an 8:12)   Again, this is disgustingly out of context, this page explains this verse:
Yes and no. I'm going to agree with some of the comments here indicating that I have a tendency toward white men, while not necessarily extending it to a preference. I've found myself attracted to Black men and Latino men for their appearance and attitudes (and don't take this as me meaning their "blackness" or "brownness" of appearance or attitudes-- I mean these things individually to them, those singular entities).   However... the men of color who find themselves attracted to me rarely fall into this center-slice of the venn diagram. They are attracted to me because I am a woman, I am a thing with which to have sex, and/or I have big boobs/tattoos/bright hair/etc/etc/etc I breathe.  White men do this, too.  But, inherently and unfortunately, it seemingly stands out more as people of color are the minority both where I'm from and where I live currently.   I once had a lovely, brief thing with a Latino man working in a restaurant in my hometown. What eventually derailed it (quickly and violently) was his desire for me to 'wait for him' and to move back to my tiny home town to be with him. He was a wildly sweet and phenomenally handsome man, but we were SO different, despite the initial chemistry. Again,  white boys do this, too.   All this being said I have a weird "thing" for American Indian men. Which is... weird, because I tend to rail against the fetishization and perversion of all cultures, most strongly the native cultures of the Americas. I think this is, perhaps, due to my heritage though. I'm very fair, and I'm a blond these days (a redhead for years before), but my natural color is nearly black-- and my entire family is dark-complected. Genetically speaking, the most predominate part of my heritage is American Indian. If you look at my family, you see it quickly, just... you have to stare at me for a second, if you'll believe me long enough to humor that. Most of the time, though, my white friends laugh hysterically when they learn that I consider myself of mixed descent, not just European-white:  Crewnecksweatshirt, you'll do anything to try to have some heritage, huh?   So, whenever I come across a man with heritage similar and stronger than mine... I go a little ga ga, especially because our backgrounds as far as upbringings tend to be similar, and we have similarities in that sense as well. I can see familiarity in his face, a sense of home.
I'm really, really worried about my best friend. She just gave birth in a 3rd world country and everything went wrong. She's been in the hospital for nearly a week and it's been really hard on her. Seriously, if this happened in America, she'd make so much money out of a lawsuit.   I still can't believe the all the fuck ups that happened.   Day 1: Had the c-section surgery. Should've known the doctors suck because they didn't give her enough anaesthesia and she could feel them cutting her. She told them it hurt like crazy but they told her she was imagining things and wouldn't give her more until her husband yelled at them because her heart rate was going crazy. She came out feeling nauseous and dizzy, but was told it was normal.   Day 3: The nausea and dizziness kept getting worse, it's to the point where she could barely eat or drink, and her husband had to force feed her. Went to the doctor but she was told she was just having "baby blues" and needs to "just eat".   Day 5: Her husband noticed she's burning up and was pretty delirious.  Took her to the hospital and again, she was told it was just "baby blues" and she had to "stop being so melodramatic". They refused to even test her for anything.   Day 6: Started puking uncontrollably, couldn't even drink water without puking it all out. Rushed her to the hospital, and her husband finally snapped when the nurse refused to listen to her when she begged the nurse to move the IV drip and move it to the other hand because it was hurting really badly. Moved her to another hospital, they did blood tests and discovered she has a bad kidney infection. They quickly put her on an intensive course of antibiotics and closely monitored her health. By this point, she already lost a lot of weight due to dehydration and barely eating for almost a week.   Day 7: She was extremely feverish and delirious. We were all told she may end up with kidney failure.   Day 8: Doctors from the previous hospital visited her just to remind her that she had a difficult pregnancy and this entire ordeal is probably her body's fault for being too weak. She's much better and responding to the antibiotics so we're all elated.   It's Day 10 now and she's much better. The doctors say she could be out by Saturday or Sunday and I really hope they're right since missing the first week of her baby's life is hitting her hard. She's always like my big sister and seeing her breakdown crying just breaks my heart. She's always so put together and tough, it's the first time I've ever seen her cry.   I don't know how the fuck she ended up with a kidney infection. My theory is that the catheter they inserted into her wasn't sterile and that gave her a UTI that ended up hitting her kidneys after it was left untreated for so long while her body's weak after childbirth. Has this happened to anyone?
maybe try using a "dummy doll" for a small period of time. giving him treats the longer he's "ok". When he gets a bit more comfortable try it for longer. this way no one is actually involved but you at your dog.   I dealing with some anxiety with my hound. We just moved and she's adjusting to being around a more populated area and new home (she finally stopped shaking after about 2 hrs of being here.) i've gone through an average size bag of Puperoni (bought it last minute cause my jack russell has anxiety issues about the car rides) i have them in small pieces and give them for relaxing...outside potty (new house new doors...new yard...scared of the neighbors dogs).   I suffer from Anxiety/panic attacks. I've found that short bursts of exposure to things that give me these episodes has helped me "control" it better. Like shopping trips...GOTTA have my husband with me for anything longer than a quick run in and out trip. I had to start with just a few mins...just sitting on my porch. being alone at home was the worst at first. but having my babies with me helped (brought them all home with in a couple months of each other after my diagnosis and a severe freak out session when the power went out and had no phone/net/ride/scared of my neighbors. I have now been able to allow the utility workers in. Especially the one cable guy...he plays with the dogs. AND helps that my big guy likes him. Just got the cable on at the new house and he's the cable guy for here too...I was excited...and ANYWAYS... totally off track there...sorry.
I think it's because that's what they think explosions and danger sound like - fireworks. I've been shot at and hit by a few IED blasts myself. Gunshots don't sound like a car backfiring, they have more of a zing to them. Fireworks don't sound like blasts, the brisance isn't right. Sometimes I feel like people tend to milk the PTSD thing. Before you start the downvote party, let me explain. I had to get screened for TBI. During the screening, they snuck in a PTSD test. When I got the results, they basically told me that I was the most laid back guy that they ever gave the test to. I told the doctor that of course I'm laid back, nobody is trying to kill me anymore. Have I had flashbacks? Yes. Farm smells make me remember some bad times from Afghanistan. Sometimes when I'm falling asleep I get rocked by an explosion and jump awake but it's no worse than the "falling" dream people have.  I was talking about this with a few other guys I work with and it seems like most of them who have had continuous day in and day out exposure had less PTSD symptoms than someone who only dealt with the occasional mortars or had that one firefight. The problem is that no doctor will tell you that you don't have PTSD. George Michael [claimed PTSD from pneu-fucking-monia]( for fuck's sake.  I know I'm coming off as unsympathetic, but it's not that at all. I'm just bothered because I know guys who seriously need help but the system is clogged with a bunch of people who are trying to game the system because they once heard a code H shot go off during a controlled detonation.
My friend texts me once:   Her: "What are you up to?"   Me: "Studying in the plaza"   Her: "Cool"   5 minutes later she shows up crying
I have a makerfarm prusa i3v.  I've only had a few successful prints on it (replacement gears for the extruder, calibration cubes, and some 3d printed whistles) and this was the first time I ran into a problem with it (besides warping/bed adhesion). When I say I turned off the printer, I mean I unplugged it from the outlet, as this model does not have an on/off switch.   I was trying to print a hand of the king pin from Game of Thrones for a couple of my friends, and, because I already had 3 successful prints (replacement parts for the extruder) that day, decided to go make some dinner while it was printing.  I came back 40 mins later to find it had printed the first few layers, and then started air printing for the rest of the print.  I immediately stopped the print, went through the LCD to retract the plastic assuming it was clogged, it turned like it was supposed to, and I managed to pull the plastic out.  I then unplugged the printer, waited for it to cool down, unassembled the extruder, took off the hot end, plugged it back in, heated it up, and removed the rest of the plastic, I unplugged it again, let it cool down, reassembled the extruder, and plugged it back in thinking i had fixed the problem.  When I tried to feed filament back into the hot end using the LCD, the stepper motor would not turn. I thought i may have assembled it too tightly, or it was rubbing against something causing too much friction for it to turn, but after removing just the stepper motor and using the LCD to tell it to turn, it would not.  I switched the wires to where the x motor usually plugs in, and it moved when I told it to on the LCD.  Did I somehow manage to blow my stepper driver?  I thought that you could only do that if you unplugged/plugged in a motor while the device was powered on, or manually turned the motor an excessive amount. (I did manually turn it while the printer was unplugged, but not very much, I have manually moved the x and y axis way more than I did for the extruder).  Is there anything I can do to fix this issue/find out whats causing it?  Should I try to re-flash my RAMPS board and see if that helps? or do i just have to bite the bullet and buy a new stepper driver? do you have any other suggestions? thanks for the help!  (I wont be able to fiddle with it until tomorrow, roughly 18 hours from the time of posting, so I wont be able to try any solutions until then.)
Wow. Really? I mean, there are a whole lot of 'social ills' that are associated with professional sport, but seriously? I sometimes go down to my local tennis club where I used to play and have a few beers with my mates that I used to play with. Am I contributing to a social ill? No, of course not. People will become prey to social ills through their own means; they will drink whilst watching movies instead of sports ect. Futhermore, no professional sporting organisation endorses sexual assault. I'm beginning to simply think that you are trolling.   Lastly 50/50 forced sports teams? Too obvious trolling. Sport is inherently a meritocracy. The fact is, that most professional sportspeople are men. Why? Well for a start, biologically men have a greater aerobic and anaerobic capacity, as well as naturally greater strength and stamina. Thus men are far, far more likely to succeed at professional sport. As far as broadcast rights, the fact of the matter is that whatever the public demand will be televised. Hence why the female tennis is broadcast and watched by many people, its still a great competition, and its fun to watch, despite the fact that the mens players are almost certainly far better at the game. Compare that to something like basketball. The NBA is amazing to watch. Have you tried to watch a WNBA game? It's not at all fun to watch.
I've been an active member of the forums going on 10 years now, playing even longer. I'm so happy for these guys, they've made my absolutely most favorite community strive for so long and have finally made a business doing it. They pay attention to the community, the ability to mod NS2 so extensively shows this as NS1 had a huge modding fan base. I can remember doing huge collaborations for weeks at a time with several community members, all for the fun of t. If its one indie team that deserves a good launch, its this one, I've watched them try and try so hard for so long to get to this point. There was even a point where they were looking for help from the community to help build NS2 when it was first announced, I had actually started building animations using the default NS1 skulk as a test to join the team, but they decided to stay in-house and turned away the few of us trying out for the team. I was skeptical when they went to go design their own engine, but it seems to be working out great and as always the unique art style shines through.   It really does have possibly the strongest fan base of any game I've seen. Many of the forum members have been around as long as me, I can remember many summer nights playing the original mod with dozens of its current active members. What strikes me the most about the community is how unique and intelligent the members can be. Its been a kind of a home away from home to me in my hardest times.
I used to work at a Cheesecake Bistro in Richmond, VA.  One of my first days on the floor, an african american couple came in and sat in my section.  The first date vibe was palpable, as he was so overly-gentlemanly and "smooth".  His blind confidence hit the fan when she asked for Mimosa (champagne and OJ), and he stopped her and ordered "a bottle of good champagne, 2 flutes (champagne glasses, but NOBODY says that), and a glass of orange juice.   I started to open the champagne, but after the foil was off, he said "allow me", and gave her a funny grin that was supposed to seem confident but was so over acted it lost that effect.  I stood back ready to assist, but he managed to pop the cork and it landed in the booth behind her after arcing up in the air, and after the poor woman he was with cringing and flailing in fear of being hit.  I just smiled and said "Bravo!" to lighten the mood and help him out, then left the rest of the items (glasses and OJ), and went back to get their salads.   Oh my way back from the kitchen, I heard the sound of water pouring, and nearly everyone in the restaurant was rubber-necking ... in the direction of my table.  This is when I realized I had made a terrible assumption when I figured he was going to pour the OJ into the champagne glasses and then pour the champagne ...   As I came around the corner, what I saw was absolute horror on both of their faces, and on the table between them, a champagne and orange juice volcano shooting out of the bottle.  This was epic.  Science fair kids, eat your hearts out.   The date went on ok, and they both managed to avoid getting anything more than a splash on them.  They seemed to be happy when they left, but my god, a $300 champagne volcano.  That was priceless.
Feynman beautifully explained to me how if I were moving to the right at 10m/s, my normally panoramic view constrained to only see a point charge directly in front of me also moving to the right at 10m/s, I could only  observe  the presence of an electric field.   However, someone standing aside from me (their view unconstrained) would observe an electric  and  magnetic field because  charge in motion predicates a B-field's existence .   After this explanation I immediately thought of Maxwell's self-propagating electromagnetic wave, thinking that perhaps am EM-wave "shows" me its magnetic "side" or electric "side" (aspect? quality? etc.) only depending on my reference frame - but they exist in entirety - inextricably woven together - whether I view them as standalone or as some combination of E- and B-field.   THIS made me recollect my cursory overview of special relativity. I recall specifically that a few weeks ago a question was answered and received gold for explaining that entities moving at the speed of light exist in spacetime that is entirely "space-y" or "spacelike".
No, you see, if someone cites a Rihana or any other insult to music "band/artist's" song,  then  you might think that, but your assumption is  so  stupid, that makes you look like a person who has no sensitivity, who has no emotional nor musical intelligence as to relate one's feelings and experiences to a song or a poem. I'm a musician, I'm 24, I compose music, write and play songs all the time. Notice I cite Paul McCartney's lyrics.. do you know who he is? Do you know the song Hey Jude?

Here's a repost from Whisper]( that you will find interesting:     Well, then, since it is not immediately obvious, allow me to explain.   Women have much more power in relationships than men do. Not just by social convention (which, believe me, is power enough), not just because others are more sympathetic to their side of any story (which, believe me, is also more than power enough), but via the full weight and majesty of the law.   Let us construct, in our heads, a hypothetical scenario. I shall use you and I as examples, just give some sense of the impact of these events on people's lives.   Let us suppose that we meet, by chance, in some gathering place in some city where, at some time in the future, we both reside. I am tall, handsome, muscular, well-dressed, and confident; you are pretty, intelligent, charming, and you get my jokes.   Nature takes its course.   About a year later, you decide that I am a good catch, the best of your available options, and you would like to be married. You drop hints, but I demur. I like you well enough, but you want children and I do not. Not to mention that I am still considering my options and am unready to enter into any sort of lifelong pact.   (This is the branch point. This is where we tell the story of what you could legally do, were you so inclined.)   You simply stop taking your birth control pills, without a word to me. This is not a crime, because legally, I have no right to know. They are your pills, and it is your body.   After a couple of attempts which I did not know were attempts, you become pregnant. You may have attempted with other men as well. Let's leave that matter unresolved for the moment.   You do not tell me until you start to show. This is also perfectly legal.   Once I figure things out, I offer to pay for half the termination procedure. You decline to undergo one. This, too, is legal. The law allows you the "right to choose". I, however, have no such right.   I do a little snooping, and discover unused quantities of birth control pills in the bathroom cabinet. Since they come in those neatly dated little wheel-things, I am easily able to deduce the exactly day you stopped. I terminate our sexual relationship post-haste.   You are angry and accuse me of putting you in this delicate situation and then abandoning you. I demur, arguing that you placed yourself in this situation. Negotiations deteriorate.   I demand a paternity test, not feeling very trusting at this point. You refuse. You can do that. You have the legal right, it's your body, I cannot force you to undergo amniocentesis.   You give birth to a daughter, and name her Zoe. I am named on the birth certificate as the father, simply because mine was the name you gave when they asked. I was not even there.   Now, I have refused to marry you. I still have that right, in most situations. (Look up "common-law" marriage, a law that allows a woman to force a man to marry her.)   So you legally demand that I provide you with the benefits of marriage anyway, to wit, a large portion of my income. You have the legal right to do this. It's called "child support".   In court, I demand a paternity test, but am denied one. You see, because I offered to pay for an abortion, I acknowledged the child as mine. And my name is on the certificate. And, most important of all, the very court that is ruling on the matter receives a cut of all child support payments. (Bet you didn't know that, did you?)   Legally, the money is for Zoe, but the checks come to you, in your name. You can spend them however you like, with no oversight whatsoever.   I'm not even sure Zoe is mine.   Now I'm in a bad situation. But the story does not end here.   The tanking economy causes budget cuts, and my cushy job as an engineer at a major defense contractor is lost. The only thing thing I can find to replace it is a job hawking cell-phones in one of those mall kiosks. This is not, however, grounds for reducing my child-support payments. The initial amount of them was determined by my income at the time, but legally, they are a right belonging to Zoe, and determined by Zoe's need, so my income is not a factor.   Now I cannot pay. I am a "deadbeat dad", according to society. And the newspaper my photo is published in. And the website my picture is posted on.   My failure to pay tanks my credit rating, too, with all its attendant woes.   The economy loosens up a bit, and I reapply to my old firm. They're keen to hire me, but they can't. With a record of delinquent child support payments, I cannot pass the background check. Now my career is blighted, too.   Many years have passed at this point, and I'm in deep trouble. Broke, no career prospects, poor credit, spotty criminal record (failure to pay child support is a misdemeanor in some jurisdictions), depressed, no means or confidence to attract another woman even if I could ever trust one again.   But the story doesn't end here.   Desperate, I manage to find some pretext to visit you, and I steal some of Zoe's hair from her hairbrush in the bathroom. I pay for a lab test out of my meager remaining resources.   Zoe isn't mine.   I take you to court, and lose. Yes, lose. Because I had already been paying child support, I am the publicly acknowledged father. (If you do not believe this could possibly happen, I sympathize. It's crazy. But google "joseph michael ocasio" and prepare to be shocked.)   Okay, end of scenario.   Look where we are. My life is indeed ruined. At no point did I have any power to stop it (except by remaining celibate my entire life). At every point, what you did, you had the legal right to do. You didn't have to "get away" with anything. You could write a book about it, and nothing would change, because it was all legal.   The only thing protecting most men from this fate is nothing but women's lack of inclination to do this. They are entirely in her power.   Would you accept being in an 1700's-style marriage, where your husband owned everything, and had the legal right to beat you, simply because he was a "nice guy and wouldn't do that"?   That is precisely what men are being asked, no, expected, to accept.   Is it any wonder we are distrustful and suspicious to the point of paranoia? It's our only defense. The law will not protect us. The law is against us, straight down the line.   Think about it. Try to imagine how that might feel.
You're starting with a universal theme of a broken world and its weight on man. That shows a thoughtful, sensitive soul, so you're on the right track. One of the challenges in tackling this subject is that we're talking about the  whole  world and everything that's wrong it it. We're wrestling with something immense, dark and overwhelming. From that you're hoping to extract something hopeful and reassuring. I would argue that if you get your poem there without practically torturing yourself, you've probably overlooked something, and I think the things specifically missed here are a convincing portrait of what needs to change, and a real, human resolution to fight the tide. Stylistically, I think the choice of rhymed couplets threatens to make your poem come across a little too cute for the subject matter. Another challenge of rhyming in general is that it tends to dictate the flow of your every line and generally leads us to sacrifice  something , although sometimes those sacrifices are made subtly without our noticing or admitting it, in pursuit of the rhyme. You actually allude to enjoying poetry in your poem, which you summarize as "words that rhyme", and there's certainly no shortage of beautiful examples that are worthy inspirations. Still, rhymed verse is a pathway that can take you all the way from Shakespeare to Reader's Digest, so it needs a critical eye to be kept on it.   You're likely already familiar, but one of the most famous poems ever written deals with similar ideas.
When i was in high school i played on a traveling baseball team. We had a guy on our the team that was just kind of different.   We had a tournament in Corpus-Christi, TX in July. Our first game was at 1PM. The team all shows up and begins to prepare for the game. I had been having problems with my lower back and was using a product similar to this to help me play through the pain.   Now bring back in the "different" guy...he asks me if he can borrow it. At first I find the request a bit odd, but end up letting him use it. I go about putting my cleats on and then I look over to him and see that he is applying this to his underarms.   At this point I am in utter disbelief that he would use someone else's deodorant, and also how he was about to be in a world of hurt. He left the game to go back to the hotel to shower because he couldn't take the pain.
You're right, there's no such thing as correct boobs. However your accusation that he must've been tainted by porn and only likes fake boobs is unfounded.   Boobs look different. Some look nicer than others. People will disagree about which boobs look nicer than which other boobs, because that's how opinions work. It is perfectly possible to have a preferred look for boobs without it having to be "omg fake boobs yay". It's ridiculous to imply that to have a preferred type one must've been brainwashed by fake tits.   On top of that, "correct" != "norm". This is misrepresenting it to try to make a counter argument for an argument that was never made. I suspect it was done because you can post something that will be popular, and as a result people will overlook that it isn't what was actually said. Go look at answers for the Monty Hall problem, and you will note that the correct answer and the normal answer are complete opposites. This is because correct and normal aren't the same thing, even if there is generally a heavy overlap.   And finally, we often recognize something as not the norm, but  better than  the norm. One could easily say that Kate Upton has "correct" boobs, and be recognizing her for NOT being the norm. Do not mistake someone saying this is the right way with "this is what's expected." I may like Kate Uptons boob's and think they're the right shape, but that doesn't mean I'd expect everyone to have boobs like that.
We've been friends for a while now and I started to gain feelings for him a little more than a year ago, so I kind of want to know if I should just keep this friendship as it is or maybe take it further, and if i  should  take it further, how do I find out that he actually feels the same way as i do?   Over the past year, we've acted more like a couple than any of my friends and their bfs/gfs. neither of us are the type to throw around the word "love", yet we say "I love you" to each other quite often and tell eachother about how not talking for longer than a week feels like an eternity and say other things that I'd feel way too lame to tell you about, ahaha. but anyways,  I kind of feel like we  are  "together" but neither of us have, i guess made it official or not, by saying whether we're boyfriend/girlfriend yet, y'know? He's an amazingly nice guy so I really don't want to look stupid and find out that we're just really close friends or it's just his kindness or something like that, IDK. maybe if you could help me find a way to ask what's going on between us without making it seem like i think we're dating or not... if that makes sense?   I'm trying to be a little cautious with what details i give out because he's also a redditor and i have no idea of what his username is, but anyways, if you could kindly help me out here, i'd really appreciate it!
GAME OF THRONES SPOILERS BELOW   > I am quite happy it didn't go to HBO.   Me too.   But HBO would have cancelled it after the 2nd season.   HBO really does care about quality.  They're not bound by numbers like broadcast or even basic cable.  They have no advertisers.  They aim for every series to be able to get at least a Golden Globe or Emmy nomination.   Season 2 would have led to cancellation due to subpar quality.   > Not necessarily for the gore portion but for the pointless scenes that HBO is so keen on throwing into GoT and other series. They waste so much time adding in those unnecessary sex scenes and completely bypass character development and plot progression.   Ok, people who say this either don't watch Game of Thrones, or they're over-the-top conservative.  They  barely  showed any sex or nudity last season.   Also, the "sex scenes" are so incredibly over-estimated.   Last season, out of the 520 minutes in the season, I bet there are maybe 90 seconds of sex (all unclothed) and 2-3 minutes of nudity.  That's less than unclothed sex in about 0.3% of the season, and nudity in 1% of the total time, or 1 minute of nudity for every 250 minutes or so.   They spend as much time doing "sex scenes" as The Walking Dead does simulated sex scenes.  Abraham and Rosita's sex scene was far more unnecessary than  any  sex scene in the recent season of Game of Thrones.   And ironically, you say the sex scenes are "unnecessary."  They called it "sexposition" for a reason, as in, they used sex scenes to deliver exposition so that people can receive  necessary  information during a sex scene, like a spoonful of sugar in your medicine. And this was maybe in season 1 and season 2.  They've had fewer and fewer sex scenes and nudity with every season.   I challenge you to name even one "unnecessary sex scene" in the entire series of Game of Thrones; and I challenge you to name more than 2 combined minutes of sex last season among the 520 minutes.  Every season has to pack so much information that they can't spare even one minute to random sex that is "unnecessary."   That's why I say you definitely did not watch the last season of Game of Thrones.  What sex scenes where there?  And I don't even need to ask of sex scenes that "bypass character development and character development," because I can say 100% there weren't any.  This isn't opinion, but FACT.   In the first episode, we have Oberyn and Elaria in the brothel, which is ironically the best way to introduce  character  traits and development.  That scene didn't even feature  sex,  only some nudity.  But the scene showed 1) Oberyn and Elaria are a couple, and they are open, 2) Oberyn is bisexual, 3) Oberyn is a prince, 4) Oberyn is confident, to the point that he gets what he wants simply through persuasion (like seducing and persuading the male handler to prostitute himself), 5) his hate for Lannisters (he stops foreplay to deal with them), and 6) his confident combat skills, by outdrawing the Lannister man trying to reach for his sword.  That's A LOT of information for a "sex" scene....that didn't even actually involve sex.  It involved Oberyn looking and clothed girls, who undressed when told, and then put their clothes on when dismissed.  Only 2 girls got naked, and only one stayed, and the "sex" was the one naked girl getting in bed with Elaria, and that was it.  Oberyn grabbed the male's crotch.  NO SEX.   There was only one sex scene with Daenerys last season, and that was just implied, with the man (Daario) simply disrobing, and less than 20 seconds later the next day has arrived.  Daenerys didn't disrobe at all.  And the point of the 20-30 seconds of the lead-up to  imagined sex  was meant to set-up a burgeoning relationship between Dany and Daario, and to start a discussion of trust between Dany and Jorah about Daario, which led into talk about what to do with the masters of Yunkai.... which ended with Jorah convincing Dany to change her mind, and Dany telling Jorah to tell Daario that Jorah was the one to convince Dany.  PURPOSE, and literally the least amount of sex implication possible (no one was shown getting in or out of bed, only Daario was shown disrobing, and that was it.  No sex sounds.  No panning or fading out to imply sex.  Just a cut to the next day, and it didn't even show Dany and Daario in bed together).   No sex scenes for Jon Snow, Stannis, Sansa, Tyrion, Bran, Tywin, Varys, Tommen, Margery, or any of the other regular characters...   There were 2 sex scenes with Jaime and Cersei Lannister, neither of which had nudity.  The first one was borderline rape by Jaime, showing that he is frustrated with Cersei's rejection of Jaime, and also showing Jaime's complete disrespect for his son, Joffrey.  Also shows that Jaime isn't suddenly a 100% good person just after 1.5 seasons captured and spending time with Brienne -- he still has a bit of evil in him.  And they didn't even really show sex, but the beginning of it.   The second sex scene was Cersei taking over.  It represented a moment where she "chooses who her family is," which came after she threatened her father and told Jaime that they're "allowed to choose family."  Again, that lasted like 30 seconds, and there was no nudity in either "sex" scene.   The only other real sex scene was Littlefinger and Lysa Arryn, and that was Lysa screaming loudly for 20 seconds while showing Sansa trying to sleep.  It was to show how crazy in love Lysa was, and it showed why she did whatever Littlefinger did for her.... and  Lysa is basically the ENTIRE reason why the entire series exists at all.  (she killed Jon Arryn, which threw the kingdom in chaos and it forced Ned into King's Landing to take over as The Hand, which ended up with his beheading, and there was an entire  WAR  by the North because Ned was attacked even before he was beheaded.  Then, she LIED to her own SISTER warning her about the Lannisters and accusing them of killing Arryn, making Catelyn suspicious and causing her to kidnap Tyrion after Bran falls and an assassin tries to kill him.  The kidnapping of Tyrion caused Tywin to go to war to get him back, and it caused Jaime to fight Ned in the streets.   So, the entire series wouldn't exist without Lysa Arryn doing all those things.... so there NEEDS to be a reason why she did all those things for one man, and it was out of love, and they depicted that love by broadcasting her wild screams while having sex with Littlefinger -- they didn't even show it.   Then, there were the rape scenes in the background of the mutineer scenes, but those weren't sex scenes since they weren't the focus.  Nonetheless, they established how dark the mutineers were and how far they had fallen, and how they were antagonists now and no longer a part of the Night's Watch.   That's all.   Those are all the sex scenes from last season.  How did ANY of them get in the way of "character development and plot progression"??   As for nude scenes, there was Missandei bathing nude and Grey Worm sort of spying, which turned into a romantic conversation between the two where he started by apologizing.  The only other nude scene was Melisandre, the red priestess, bathing and talking to Stannis' wife.  Stannis wife is jealous of her body, but Melisandre reassures her that "it's just flesh" and that the sex meant nothing, and more importantly, the scene empowered Sheila by taking away her insecurity thanks to Mel.
I’m back to this throwaway account again, lucky me! Wife and I have been married for just under two months and I just spoke to her on the phone during lunch to learn she gave her family $500 to cover the rent for their house, let’s call it Park House (2 bedroom apartment) and wanted to give them $200 to cover the rent for this month. We’ve just bought a 3 bedroom house, let’s call it Straight House. She says she didn’t tell me because she didn’t want to stress me out. BS! There's a number of factors that contribute to why I'm really mad. Every time I think about this and the way I found out, I get angry. Typing this out now, I’m fuming! Ok, so let’s get some facts for the sane people of reddit to give me perspective… 1.) She has a younger brother in first year of college, living away on campus (only home for the summer)... 2.) She has two younger sisters, one is away on internship in other country for a couple of months (not sure how permanent it may be), the other lives in Park House and does not make enough to cover the rent of this fancy 2 bedroom flat. 3.) Her parents do not live in this country and only come here 2/3 times a year…. 4.) I’ve reduced my hours at work for the last few weeks to spend more time on a catering business project I’m setting up. She’s quite passionate about the business too, but really it’s my baby and I come with 90% of the ideas etc…   So, I had an important mini-launch event this weekend just gone. As part of my reduced wages, we agreed she would pay our mortgage this month. I usually pay the mortgage so she’s asked for the payment details so she can pay it. She sent me a message this morning asking for me to hurry up with the information before money goes out of her account for other stuff. It was quite an urgent message where she said “shit was going on in her family” so I made a point to bring it up in our usual lunch-break conversation. She said on the phone that once she paid for the mortgage there would be barely anything left in her account so, I was a bit shocked and asked her where exactly the rest of the money was going out to. I had to draw it out a bit but she finally revealed that she had paid $500 to her parents who couldn’t afford the rent in Park House the month before and was planning on giving them $200 to help them pay the rent this month. I blew up and told her we would talk about it in more depth when I got home later.   I’m so angry and upset. Since November/December I knew this would happen and have always said it was financially silly for her family to try and pay for Park House. Apologies in advance if the money doesn’t phase you but combined with my reduced wages and investment in the new business and then, just based on the principle of it… I’m really upset and its money we can't afford to give out. It puts us on the bare minimum and following the wedding and other bits and bobs, we're far from in the black at the moment. FYI, she has a poor credit rating, my credit rating is very good. Also, for our culture/religious background, we practice a more traditional style of marriage…or at least I hoped… and feel this massively undermines me and what we agreed. To be fair, the rent for Park House is relatively cheap for that kind of house/location but still, it’s something her family always struggle to pay for. I would rather the family stayed with us at Straight House whenever they needed to, than we paid rent to Park House. She did apologise on the phone for not telling me about it and said she didn't want to stress me out in the lead up to the mini-launch event. But I don't really buy it and after a few seconds she said we should move pass the conversation as she's already apologised...which is typical of her and is a sign to me that she hasn't 100% regretted the action. Anyway, I got off the phone and said we would talk about it later tonight....
We have been together for a year and a half. This "once a month" thing was less visible in the first stages of our relationship, but now that we are getting close together, it's going out of control.   In a normal setup, my girlfriend is just wonderful and loving. When she is about to have her period, she becomes really difficult to talk to in a reasonable way. She acts like the very spawn of satan. Everything i do is wrong. I breath -> wrong. I don't breath -> wrong, sorta. I tried to talk to her about this issue a lot, but everytime i failed or nothing actually changes.   I have tracked her period and i see that every discussion and explosion of anger is in the 7 days window before her period. I am no doctor, but this is what pms sounds like.   I really don't know how to handle this and i am asking for advice/similar stories. No matter how much caring and loving i am, she always finds a reason to be judging and get angry at my every move.   She is also ultra emotional. Despite the fact that she is an incredibly good looking girl, she feels absolutely ugly and fat. Moreover, she is suffering some eating disorder that gives her stomach pain everytime she eats anything. I told her that when something like this happens, one should go to a doctor. Needless to say, she refuses to go.   Sorry for the wall of text, i hope that someone can give me a hint to deal with this kind of situation.
Build Help]   I am currently building my first from scratch gaming rig. I've been saving for a very long time, so my budget for my machine is quite high (around 2.5k USD). I will be buying a 4770k as my CPU, so my mobo needs an LGA 1150 socket. I am looking for the best motherboard suited for gaming. Price is no real object, however I don't want to be wasteful. I am willing to spend more for features that will contribute to gaming, but I am not a hardcore overclocker. If the boards sole intention is to overclock to ridiculous levels and doesn't have anything that will improve gaming performance, I've no interest. I'm going to use dual channel 16g 1866 ram
I am always in the minority here but I liked SSJ4 for a few reasons (note I still think GT as a whole sucks):     The only input Toriyama had on GT was a rough sketch of SSJ4 which showed Goku with the ape fur and black hair. This means that although it may not be canon, SSJ4L somewhat was within Toriyama's blessings.     Understanding super saiyan and the purpose of transformations in DBZ. In dbz all life forms have access to ki energy, some much more than others. However every body has a physical limit to the amount of ki is can withstand. Many alien lifeforms have a workaround this by 'transforming' their genetic structure to house more energy. Evidence of this being Freiza and Zorbon. Their transformations generally keep their original theme but some races change completely. Saiyans way of transformation was Oozaru, or a gigantic ape. Saiyans are basically weremonkies and follow the motifs of werewolves such as taking some primape characteristic of their wer-self (tails, aggressive instincts). Super Saiyan is unique to saiyans in that it is the most effecient transformation of any currently known race but it is nearly impossible to achieve. However the only physical characteristics that change is just the hair wjich turms yellow from the ki energy. SSJ4 resembles what a saiyan should look like naturally with wermonkey characteristics or the natural conclusion to the SSJ transformation if we're following the patterns established with other races.
A mere two hours ago, I was your average Wredditor browsing through the subreddit of /r/SquaredCircle. I lurked around, and noticed an Erick Rowan post. I thought to myself, "Hmm, I've always respected Rowan. In fact, I own a sheep mask like that of his!", so I clicked on the link. In it, I saw the nicest man ever meeting with a sick child. I read the entire article, tears in my eyes and all. I thought to myself "Where has this man been all of my life?"   My lurking continued as I found myself looking through the comment section of this post. Many nice things directed towards this great man. Eventually, I found myself face to face with a comment directing me to /r/ErickRowan. It was in that very moment in which I clicked on that link, that I found myself immersed in the world of Mr. Rowan... I browsed through the subreddit whilst jamming to our anthem, "Sheepherder", for what seemed like an endless amount of time!   I am now one of you guys, and forever will be. I thought I'd share my story of becoming a follower of Erick Rowan, so here it is. LONG LIVE THE ROWAN EMPIRE!!!
Disclaimer: I'm not a dentist, but I have had my wisdom teeth out.   My experience getting my wisdom teeth out wasn't bad at all.  They put you under, and it feels like the next minute they're waking you up, except now you have giant wads of gauze in your mouth and you're quite woozy from the anesthesia.  Once you get home, the first several hours to the first day kind of suck because you're stuck with the gauze in your mouth and you're going to be feeling the aftereffects from the surgery.  By the next day, I was feeling better and able to get up and do stuff around the house (nothing too strenuous, just laundry, etc).  After a few days everything is back to normal except for the great honking holes in your mouth.  That, to me, was the worst part of the whole ordeal, since you have to wash out the holes with a giant syringe to ensure that no food gets stuck in the holes.
This is going to get buried and may not even count as attempted murder but as a form of bullying/harassment- regardless I was almost drowned.   I was in elementary school, 4th grade, bullied since kindergarten, and at 10 had issues with depression and anxiety. We went on a field trip to the local state park with a bunch of 5th graders. This park includes a lake with a swimming area. Now I didn't want to go but my mom didn't let me skip and so here I am sitting on the "beach" after some hike in a bathing suit being picked on, kicked, and having sand thrown in my face.   I decided I had enough so I went to the water. Now we weren't allowed in without a buddy but I had no friends and the teachers weren't paying attention so I went to an area outside of the swimming section. A couple kids followed me and started pushing me around. They thought it'd be fun to hold me under water, I'm not sure how long as at some point I passed out. I guess that's when the teachers finally noticed or someone went and got help I'm not sure.   I have vivid memories about being bullied leading up to it but after, not so much.  I remember being back on the beach feeling like I couldn't breathe and being told the ambulance was on the way.   The kids that did it to me got a few days of suspension but nothing else. No charges, no expulsion, just a few days home watching movies and playing games before they came back. Nothing changed with them. They continued to bully me well up until high school when I finally was able to transfer schools. But it fucked me up mentally.   For the longest time I couldn't take baths or shower and would wash with a wet washcloth. Which lead to more bullying about hygiene. I had to skip the swimming lessons in gym class, more bullying. I skipped the field trips to water parks and nature hicks ect. More bullying. I saw numerous counselors and therapists. More bullying. And yet I still tried to be friends with the people that tried to drown me.   I was fucked up for a long time, even over a decade later I still have issues. I didn't learn to swim until I was 16. I don't go into large bodies of water past my knees. I have panic attacks when I get water on my face. These kids grew up thinking bullying was fine, one was actually just kicked out of college due to harassment and another is in jail for aggravated assault charges.
On the one hand it is hard for me to believe that anyone that close to Hitler and Nazi leaders had no knowledge of the Holocaust and all the horrible things they were doing. On the other hand I would not expect the Presidents bodyguards to know what he is doing besides where he is traveling and how  keep him safe. So, it is very possible this guy had no idea what was going on.   There is no record of Hitler ever going to a concentration camp, and I doubt any of the Nazi leaders were talking publicly about how many people they were killing, especially directly to a bodyguard. Maybe he did know, but I want to give the benefit of the doubt unless informed otherwise.
Basically I have a friend who I have spent lots of time helping work on their car mechanically, and car audio projects, and a few other things, for free. They now have a motorcycle project but seem to think my time is just abundant and free.   I do this type of stuff to put food on my table, but they offer me no compensation. Friends should help friends but I feel Im the only one who really puts in any investment to the friendship.   So I kinda hesitated to help on this motorcycle project.   This friend has a little business of his own, which I have given him tons of business. Knowing he taxes me on all of purchases because hes got to make some money for his efforts and time.   Well he broke something on the motorcycle, something somewhat important and all hell broke loose and it somewhat blamed on me because he asked to borrow a torque wrench and I lent it to him, but he didn't have the right socket to match up so he winged it. And broke shit.   Poetic justic?
Ive never cleaned up my semen when I finish, I just pulled back my pants up and on with my merry way. About the past year or so, I'm been having redness on my side of my genitals and the side of leg where it touches my genitals (used to clean genitals everyday in shower, but it got to the point it hurts so much I cant do it anymore). This has cause terrible rashes (legs only) and discomfit. I'm to embarrassed to see a docter.
I'm a 22y/o male with a sex drive to match. I've known my SO for 7 or 8 years and we've been together on and off for most of those, and we've been going steady since February of 2013. We just recently moved into an apartment together and things are going well for the most part.   My GF was sexually abused by her previous boyfriend before we got back together. In the beginning it didn't really affect her and sex was great. Once it kind of "sunk in" the sex stopped completely. I vowed to do anything and everything I could to help her, I never put any pressure on her or anything. At the time I'm writing this we have not had sex, or ANY kind of sexual contact, for 8 months.   Eventually it seemed like she was getting better. She would mention in conversation that she thought she was ready to try again but we needed a place to do it (we lived with our parents at the time). There were countless opportunities to make it happen in that time (including a week where I had the entire house to myself) but it never happened.   Last night I looked upset and my gf asked why and I finally told her. I felt unattractive and invalid.   This greatly upset her.   I have no idea what she's been through and I don't know what it's like to constantly have to feel pressured to have sex and feel attractive and etc etc. She said it's "always about sex" but this is the first time I've even broached the subject in a long time. I wanted to open a discussion with her and talk about our feelings and maybe figure out some issues (ya know, like you're supposed to do in relationships) but all I got for my efforts was an argument.   We eventually made up and didn't go to bed angry at least, but I'm still right back where I started in the first place. The only difference now is that she knows I'm unhappy without sex. Which just stresses her out more, because she doesn't want to give it to me, or to anyone.   Last night, she told me that "sex sucks" and she "never wants to have it again."   I am  not  going to cheat on her, and I don't want to break up with her. I want to fix our problems and be with her but I don't know where to start, especially if I can't talk to her without starting an argument.   Sorry for rambling. I hope someone has some kind of input that can help me out.
I'll try to keep this in cliff note format: First, although I agree with the MEF sentiment, I most strongly align with the AGP model, so that's what I will refer to it as. Second, I do a poor job at even articulating what is causing me such duress, so try to bear with me.   -I have had AGP since my earliest memories. It was sexual at a young age, despite not recognizing it as sexual until much later.   -AGP is the necessary and sufficient condition for me to experience sexual feelings. I do not think I can have romantic, interpersonal relationships due to my AGP. I fall in love with women, but it ends there. I cannot force myself to be sexually attracted to them.   -I started getting therapy at 18 for AGP and now I am 23. I have had severe depression for these past 5 years. There are literally only brief moments in any given year that I can actually feel happiness.   -I have been on every anti-depressant in the book, and I have seen approaching 10 different therapists of varying specialties and education levels. Nothing seems to help.   -But most recently, a new therapist told me I may be grieving the loss of an ideal. I think he meant that ideal of being a heteronormal male. I feel robbed of that life. For all purposes, I AM a normal heterosexual male. Except I just can't handle having these sexual fantasies.   -People say it gets better, but I can hardly stand it anymore. Each day, I sit and wait and count down the hours until I can go to sleep. I don't know what keeps me going. It's been 5 years and I've tried everything to combat depression such as healthy eating, exercise, and socializing. None of that helps. There is no reprieve. It's a specter looming over me, always on the back of my mind, always creeping up on me.   -Nobody can take this away from me and I don't know how to live a happy and fulfilling life having AGP. It has robbed me of everything, all of my hopes, dreams, and desires.
He always talks about moving to Florida (like within a year). And when I say "always," i mean like every other day. So last night we went out, and I said, "I don't know where we'll be in a year, but if you move, I don't want to waste an amazing year." (Implying that I want to be with him for as long as I can.) His response was, "Well thanks for giving me perspective. Like you don't see this long term."   I was like, "What?! You talk about moving all the time, that's really not fair of you to say."   Then we kind of moved on. But I feel like I really hurt him by saying that. I do love him very much, but I don't think I'd move with him (My entire family is here). But I also feel like: how can I look at a long term future with him (which he says he sees with me), if he's always talking about leaving!?!? (Even if maybe deep down he doesn't mean it, I almost want to ask him to stop talking about it then. Is that unreasonable??)
A main character just needs to have a large impact on the story, not be involved in every single game, or at the very least the majority of them. I think NOT calling her a main character is a little much! She was Snake's driving force in MGS1, critical to his success in MGS4, and hell, she even had her own ending in MGS1, in case you were manly enough to save her! Not to mention the emotional connection Kojima develops for the player with her.
I disagree. Whatever you do, don't talk to anyone until you have a lawyer present. People can get in trouble for shit they didn't do just cause a cop misheard you say something and it makes it to a judge. Or even the cop forget he mentioned something you used in your response which makes you suspicious (IE "I don't even own a gun" in response to "Did you shoot him", where officer thinks he asked "Did you kill him" Extreme example, but you get the point). There's this whole 30 min video that showed up here a while ago about it, but I'm too lazy to look it up.
You don't have to be religious to think sexual imagery on every magazine cover, billboard and music video has reached its tipping point. I predict we're on the precipice of a backlash.   For instance, Miley Cyrus has killed her ticket sales with all the faux Lewinskys she performs on stage, Rihanna has pissed off [all of Ireland]( by showing off her tits too much and I've heard numerous comedians on podcasts discuss how you have to work clean today and audiences are now put off by dirty jokes.
I see a lot of hate here when people mention grinders:   Some would say that they waste your weed, while others scoff at the idea of hand grinding. I realize that this is incredibly long, but I found it interesting for myself.   I am here so say (as a man with a  very  nice grinder) that there are merits to both methods in my own opinion. Here are my pros and cons to both. I've decided to heat my vape up and explain my points.   Also: I get progressively higher as I write this, enjoy.   Grinder pros:     Easier to throw nugs in than to painstakingly rip them up. For example, I wouldn't bother making edibles if I didn't have a grinder, especially when I have to grind 14 grams     Good storage method if you're on the go. This might appeal to those still in school or those who like hiking.     Keif!!!^1 (For those with 3 chamber grinders)       ^1 Some hand grinding advocates would say that this is a con because it makes the weed you smoke less potent^2   ^2 Some would argue that grinding by hand causes kief that would be collected in the grinder to stick to your fingers, wasting it anyway.   Grinder Cons     More drug paraphernalia for the cops to take. I'd recommend that if you ever want to smoke in a car (which I don't personally recommend, but I'm not telling you what to do), don't bring your grinder. If you get pulled over or driven up to, you're probably gonna lose it with your stash and pieces. I've had so many friends buy $50+ grinders and then lose them because they got pulled over. If you have a grinder that you like and you're going for a ride, grind up by hand or grind ahead of time.     Your weed burns faster when ground up. Some would still find this a pro, but when I'm passing a bowl around with 3-4+ people, I like my smoke sessions to be as prolonged as possible. Generally, grinders do their jobs very well: they will shave your cannabis finely compared to doing it manually. Finer parts=more surface area to burn at a given time, making your bowls burn through quicker. That's just poorly explained science, you can't argue with that. And yes, I know, you have like  the best grinder ever  and this doesn't apply to you. Shut up, I'm not talking to you anyway!
Fear not, my fellow height impaired rider! Fit is always important but more so when you're shorter. What they all said about top tube. For us short folks fit's the difference between agony or ecstasy on a bike . Even our hands are smaller, means the brifters are adjusted, WSD bars, it all fits.   That being said I'm 5'1" and I ride; Salsa Vaya is 50 cm, which was a shock to me but hot dayum it fits. Shorter top tube made the difference. I have a custom road bike that's 44 cm, a Soma Buena mixte that's 46 cm, a found on the side of the road rebuilt bike that's probably 50 cm but it's a mixte so stand over is not an issue. Also had a Trek 520 that was a 44 cm.   If you're short in terms of bike fit you'll have 4 choices;   Sloping top tube (nothing wrong with that) and or ...   Smaller wheels (no problem either) and or ...   Toe overlap (biiiiiiiiiiiiiiig problem) and or ...   Full custom or customize the bike. Either  of those are big fun or big expenses. My 520 was customized, just kept adjusting and that was fun and cheap. Making upgrades over time such as shorter crank arms, WSD bars (Who knew you can shift, brake and steer all at once? With bars that came with the bike that were too wide, I couldn't), shorter stem etc. Net effect was full custom bike.   Have fun finding and fitting a bike.
Hell no. Nor do I think we WILL go to war. Both countries have elections this year and are posturing to gain incremental advantages over opponents- Ahmadinejad vs Khamenei, Obama vs Republicans. As others have mentioned, Iran would have no chance in an actual war. Would Iran's leaders actually risk the lives of millions of Iranians in a devastating war? Certainly not. Does the US have the capital or morale for a war with Iran? Certainly not a full scale war (in the US's political climate there would be protests, even riots, larger than the Iraq War protests if, say, hypothetical President Newt wanted to declare war). So each side bluffs publicly. Obama/Panetta state all options are on the table; Iran threatens to close down the Straits of Hormuz. But why would Iran continue to discuss the possibility of compromise on nuclear weapons if war was coming? And what are we to make of the  wikileaks rumors that Ahmadinejad is possibly willing to reform Iran/establish relations to ease the sanctions? ? I think- and this may be wrong too- that the US and Israel are basically appearing as a good cop, bad cop conundrum for Iran. So, in conclusion, no hot war will happen (though covert shit is certainly going down) and missile strikes won't be an course of action. This is a mini Cold War, one the US will win. Maybe I am arrogant to think that. Prove me wrong :)   edit:
There is so much I want to say, and I can't include it all without boring the heck out of everyone. This is a long read, but I want to provide enough of a background so that you guys can understand what I have been through! I apologize in advance and truly appreciate your time and advice!   When I was 18 years old, a senior in highschool, I noticed a very beautiful girl in the hallway and during lunch hour. My friends and I had no idea who she was, but everyone was googly eyed over her. I was a very confident, good looking guy, and I used to tell my friends that I'd eventually talk to her. Fast forward a couple months, and I found out who she was. She was a year younger than me, a junior in high school at the time. I discovered we had a mutual friend, and had her hook us up. During the summer, after I graduated, I had our friend arrange some time to hang out at a coffee shop. I discovered she was a really good girl, very quiet, shy, but strikingly beautiful and I wanted to learn more about her. From there, I got her number and we texted, etc, and went on a date the following weekend. I was a very outgoing person, I partied, loved to go out with friends, and I also was a very successful DJ at the time. I DJed at a bunch of different clubs, produced music, threw parties, etc. I was also your typical high school "playboy". I only dated one girl before her, and had been with maybe 7 or 8 girls before her. As we started to hangout more, I learned she never had a boyfriend, whenever guys tried talking to her, she told them she had a boyfriend, etc. She was a virgin, which was something that was really important to me at the time. She had a small group of friends, and didn't do much on the weekends, or for fun. Sounds boring, right? For some reason, this really attracted me to her and I wanted to be with.   Fast forward a few months, and she became my girlfriend. I knew she was very shy, inexperienced, and I ALWAYS respected that. I didn't even try "making out" with her until she made the move. I didn't want to pressure into anything to make her uncomfortable. In fact, we didn't have sex until nearly a year into dating.   Around that time, I discovered she was a very insecure person, I suppose had low self esteem, and because of this she was very jealous. She knew my passion was music, but DJing at clubs every weekend made her uncomfortable. We talked about it, and I was willing to end my DJ career to show her how serious I was about being with her and that I cared about her feelings and really liked her. This made her feel really special and she appreciated what I did for her. Well, this really bothered me, but I completely understood where she was coming from, so I quit. But I also stopped making music, and music no longer became a hobby of mine.   Around this time, she told me she took medication for anxiety and depression. She was also seeing a therapist that her mom made her see. Her grandma died when she was younger, and she had a very very close relationship with her and this had a lot to do with her depression. She would see her therapist and talk to her and text her about our relationship. Whenever she was anxious about me hanging out friends, or going out, she would talk to her and it would calm her down. I noticed she would not talk to me about her problems a lot, and this is when I noticed she lacked the communication skills necessary for a relationship. I was very empathetic towards her anxiety and depression and did my best to be there for her and make her feel loved and appreciated.   A little more than a year into the relationship, around Christmas time, I took a weekend trip to New York to visit a very close cousin and friend of mine. When she found out I was going, she was VERY upset and didn't trust the fact that I was going to be in a different state with a cousin of mine who is a single male. She thought that we would be hanging out with girls, drinking, going out, etc.   When I got to NYC, she started to blow up my phone, constantly asking what I am doing, who I am with, where we were at, etc. It was VERY stressful because she was taking my enjoyment away from my trip. It got to the point where my cousin found out, and he just thought it was nuts that she was acting this way. Anyways, I came back from NYC and we talked, and she apologized for how she acted and I reassured her that I was faithful, that we really didn't do much except for some shopping, sightseeing, etc. She said she believed me, was sorry, and that it wouldn't happen again. I also felt bad that I gave her a reason to be jealous, and didn't want her to feel that way. Looking back, 5 years later, I can't believe I didn't see the warning signs... I really loved her and wanted her to feel loved and wanted her to know how serious I was about us and that I was very loyal, and worthy of her trust. For Christmas that year, I bought her a $700 promise ring from Tiffany, and some other gifts. When I gave her the ring, I told her that I always promised to love her, be loyal to her, be there for her, and that one day I would marry her. She cried from joy, and we had an amazing 2nd Christmas together. This was in 2011, so I don't remember everything, but I do remember about 2 weeks after Christmas, she got jealous that I was going to hangout with some friends one night and was fighting with me. I thought it was crazy that she could act that way, considering what I did for her. I guess I thought the ring would change her jealousy and self esteem. Boy was I wrong...   Over the next few years, we spent A LOT of time together, we would hang out almost every day, every weekend. We kind of suffocated one another with our presence. We took classes together at a community college, did homework together, studied together, etc. I barely hung out with my friends. She didn't have many friends that she kept in touch with after high school, so she hung out with her best friend every once in awhile. I hung out with my friends every couple months. I remember actually being very sad because I went from being such an outgoing person, with so many friends in high school, and now, a lot of my friends were away in college, I was still back at home, and became distanced from a lot of friends I saw every day in high school.   Over the course of these years, we would hang out a lot, and of course we fought a lot. We would fight about really dumb things. There were times we fought about homework. For example, even though she was really smart, I think she looked to me to help with her homework a lot... In fact, I ended up doing a lot of her college homework for her. She would fight with me about my past as a DJ, she would ask me who I had sex with, who I fooled around with in my past, would wants names, etc. I didn't understand why she wanted to know, especially since we had a great sex life. It's almost like she wanted to torment herself and create jealousy for absolutely no reason. She would even bring up my highschool ex for no reason sometimes. She would secretly go through my phone, and was very invasive of my privacy. I remember one time leaving my laptop at her house, and I turned around to grab it, and she was sitting at the kitchen table, going through it....   I also want to add that her family really liked me. Her mom was overall a nice person, same with her dad, and they had a lot of respect for me and knew I was a good guy. My mom and dad really liked her too. I spent a lot of time at her house because I lived in a small apartment with my mom and brother, so it was just more convenient. Since we were around her family a lot, I kind of became a part of her family. Although her mom really liked me, there were times in the past where if I went out, her and her mom would talk about it and her mom would jokingly put stuff in her head and act like I'm with girls, etc. CRAZY right? Why would she do that to her daughter when she knew I would never do that to her! Then when she would fight with me about it the next day, her mom would have my back and tell her to trust me and that I wouldn't ever cheat on her, or give her any reason to not trust me.   This is when I noticed that her mom was kind of a wack job and was a big reason for my ex's jealousy and anxiety. There were times where her mom would put her down, and they would fight a lot. Her mom also wore the pants in her relationship with her husband. He was an alcoholic, but made the money in the family, and she just loved to spend money, rack up credit card debt, etc. She was a very poor example for my ex and I really noticed it years into the relationship.   Fast forward, and we broke up a few times and got right back together within days or maybe a week at the most. I would break up with her because I couldn't take her craziness sometimes.  Or she would become very disrespectful and call me names, put me down, put my future down, etc. She would then try to contact me, apologize, etc, and then we would get back together.   She was very tough on me I guess. There were times where I would lose motivation with school because I worked full time, made pretty good money, but had a lot of financial responsibility. I lived with my mom and brother, but paid for college on my own, had a car bill, insurance, some credit card debt, and I helped my mom out with some bills because I made more money than her. I worked 40-50 hours a week, went to school full time, hung out with her almost every day and weekend, and had a lot on my plate. I also had a freelance web design business and stayed pretty busy. She worked at a retail store, didn't work much, didn't make much, and she got free college because of financial aid. If I skipped class, or something, she would FREAK OUT on me, call me a loser, say I'm not motivated, and that she doesn't want to date a dead beat guy. This should of been a warning sign of her controlling behavior, but it pushed me to prove her wrong and finish school.   One of the more serious break ups, was last summer. I had a great job at a software company, but also had a side business (start up) that my boss knew about and helped me with. During the summer of 2015, I was laid off because the company was having financial issues. I found out on a day that was my day off, and I was going out of town, about an hour or so away, with my two business partners to meet with an investor. On the way there, my boss called me with the bad news. I was devastated and worried because I needed money to support myself and my bills, school debt, etc. The startup wasn't making much money, but hey, how many of them do? Anyways, when I found out, I told my mom and she told me I would get through it, and figure things out. She told me to keep my head up and things will get better. I called my girlfriend and she had a horrible reaction. I think the first thing she said was "YOUR LYING... STFU!" She thought I was pulling a prank on her. I told her I clearly wasn't, and she kept saying "what are you going to do? you need money for bills, how are you going to go to school? where are you, why are you driving an hour away for a dumb business if you have no money." Her reaction was absolutely horrible. I never felt so horrible about myself. My business partners, who were good friends of mine, couldn't believe how she was acting. She was my girlfriend of 5 years and that is how she acted?? She kept texting me afterwards, stressing me the hell out. She said I was spending my time working on an imaginary business, when I should be looking for a job... yeah, 2 hours after I lost my job. Later that week, after lots of fighting and after absolutely no support from her, I broke up with her. I was very pissed off, stressed out over money, lack of a job, and now a selfish girl. A week in, her mom contacted me asking if I could help with her and her sister's financial aid.. even though she knew we broke up and how her daughter treated me so poorly. I told her I couldn't and that it wasn't appropriate. Her mom became desperate I guess and called me again to walk her through something and I just said "f*** it" and helped her over the phone. Later that week, my ex kept texting me, begging for a second chance, etc. She made me seem like the bad guy for not caring to hear her out, talk to her, and give her a second chance. I didn't want to hear it, so I ignored her, told her how disgusted I was and that was it.   We didn't talk for a month, but I was at the same gym as her and would see her and her mom almost every other day there. We wouldn't say a word to each other or even look at each other. During the month, I felt horrible about myself, I was going through a tough time with no job, failing startup, no girlfriend, etc. I would stalk her Pinterest and see that she posted a lot of quotes, and I would post some as well, it was almost like we were responding to each other by pinning quotes to answer to each other. Immature as hell, right? I'm so stupid... Anyways, one day, I saw her at the gym and I approached her and said I wanted to talk. She was getting ready to leave the gym and she said she would call me when she got home. She did, and we talked about how things have been, I told her how I left the startup, was looking for a job and had some good opportunities. We talked about how we thought we were done for good, how much we "learned", etc. We ended up getting back together. I knew it was a bad choice because I didn't give myself a chance to even grow as a person, I took the easy way out and she was my comfort zone. We were both so attached to each other. I remember my friends couldn't believe I got back with her. My family was shocked and disappointed in me. Her family was disappointed as well. Her mom said I kept breaking her heart and playing games.   Fast forward to now, and I have a great job, more bills, more financial responsibility, and things were rocky with her. We had a great Christmas and NYE. The rest of January was horrible. She was on her last semester of college and extremely stressed. I took on more debt to pay for my classes, and had a hard time getting caught up with bills, etc. Regardless, I made sure her Christmas was amazing, and I took her on a little trip for NYE and we had an amazing time, regardless of the money issues. We couldn't hangout much and went weeks without seeing each other because she was so busy with her last semester. I was okay with it of course because I wanted her to finish with no distractions. One day after class, I was driving home, and she called me and asked me to bring her food. I told her I didn't have any money until the next day because I paid some bills ahead of time to make sure I had money for Valentines day, her birthday, etc. She got pissed and hung up on me, and then kept texting me saying that I'm broke, don't have my head on straight, and that she doesn't understand why I have money issues, or understand how we will ever get married if I had such horrible money issues. I remember being so pissed of and went off on her. I couldn't take the damn verbal abuse from her anymore. I was so irritated that she was making me like such a piece of crap. We had marriage talks many many times and she always knew that I wanted to marry her one day and that it would happen when the time was right. When she made those comments about my money and future, I was so mad and stressed out and afterwards, had a hard time being with her.   We "made up". One week later, her family had a super bowl party and I drank way too much in front of her family. I never had a problem with drinking, but I over did it like crazy, and blacked out. Apparently I went off on her when drunk, and we got were swearing at each other, and apparently her family witnessed it all. I don't remember any of it.   That whole week we fought about it. I was extremely embarrassed and apologetic about the whole situation. I truly felt horrible. She broke up with me over text and said she was done being verbally abused by me. She said I always try to put her down, and she wasn't going to take it anymore. She even texted my mom and told her about what happened at the super bowl party and told her that she was done with me and its going to be the hardest thing for her to do but that the relationship was not healthy at all and needed to end. I was unaware of this, and texted her telling her I want to talk. She said it was over and nothing can change it. I accepted it because I was so unhappy. Valentines day passed. Her birthday passed. I never called her for either of those days. We didn't talk what so ever. I felt horrible for it, but knew there was nothing I could do to fix this. The relationship was so toxic and unhealthy, and I had to realize there is absolutely no way I could ever change her. She ended up blocking me on all social media, she deleted my family off social media as well. She shut me out of her life. It's been about two weeks now, and I understand this needed to happen. I still feel horrible though because my emotions are all over the place. I feel confused, have regret for even staying with her, sad, angry, everything... I want to be happy and have a future, and I know it's nearly impossible to have this with her. I still love her, regardless of all the pain she caused me. This breakup feels official. I tell myself there is no way in hell that I could ever go back to her, and that it is not even a possibility. I still feel crappy about myself. I keep thinking about the good moments in our relationship. I go to bed every night and have dreams of her and think about if she has moved on, maybe met someone new, etc. She was very loyal and I keep thinking about that. My ex girlfriend in highschool cheated one me, so loyalty is a big thing for me. Everyone has told me that I need to move forward and that better will come. I will meet someone new, and experience the love I deserve. I know I'm a good guy and have a bright future ahead of me, but this relationship has changed me in so many ways. I don't know how to feel anymore...   I'm sorry for writing so much... I know this was very long, but I wanted to make sure the background of all of this was included because it is very important!
I could literally write a book about the last 8 years of my life, and the trials and tribulations of my relationship with "Jane."  I will try to make this brief, but I need help.   I HATE Jane.  Literally, hate her.  We have been married almost 7 years, of which we have lived together for about 4 of them.  Other than my 2 kids (2 and 4), she has made my 20’s miserable.  She treats me like a child or an employee, and I feel like I am being controlled nonstop.  If she doesn’t get her way, she does things to force me into doing whatever it is.  I always feel like she is one step ahead of me, and I have no say in anything.  I feel like I am a super nice person, a good husband, and a great father.  I always have the best interests of everyone in mind at all times.  I go out of my way to make her happy, and give her and my kids the life they deserve.   I love her family, and have helped them on many occasions with whatever they need, and they love me in return.   With no education, and only my military background, I have managed to move up the Government IT ladder and I am now making over 100k a year.  I have worked this hard to provide my family an amazing home, and security.  Granted, I am not the greatest at saving my money, but I am working on it.  I mean, hell, I am only 29.  I have about $40k in my retirement, and a couple grand in the bank.   Anyway, Last year we filed for divorce.  I moved out to a place about a mile away, so I could be close to my kids, but I had to get away from her since it was starting to get violent around the house.  She hit me in the face while I was holding my then 8mo old son.  I called the cops, filed a report, but they did nothing.  This is not the first domestic case we have had to deal with.   Immediately the harassment began.  One instance was she literally left my kids on the front porch and said they were my problem now.  I had them for about a month until she finally came to her senses. Another time, I had my kids for the weekend, and she wanted to see them.  I wouldn’t let her, so she literally sat on my porch knocking on the door, ringing the door bell, and throwing rocks at my window for 3 hours from about 12pm-3am.   After about 6 months or being separated, going through the motions to get the divorce finalized, etc, she starts realizing that she is being crazy and calms down.  We start to get along better, and are able to have a good parent relationship for the kids.  I have a history of forgiving her for these kinds of things, and every time we end up getting back together, but I know this now so I am not falling for it, again.   Sorry, this is getting long….   So fast forward to about 10 months after moving out.  Our divorce cased got dismissed because my lawyer was a retard (different story), so we just kind of put it off.  She is getting out of the military, going to school, and needs help with the kids.  I am paying about $1600 a month in child support, so I am not quite sure what help she needs.  But anyway, my lease is about to be up and I need a place to stay.  I still own the house she is living in…  So we decide that finishing the basement, and my brother and I moving in to help with the kids and bills is a good idea.  I talk to my family, friends etc, and everyone seems to be on board.   Well, I just moved into the basement yesterday.  She has already started back on the crazy train. She wants all my stuff unpacked, and out of “her” garage tonight or she is calling goodwill to pick it up.  She wants me to pay more money for the kids, on top of the $1600 I already pay her for child support, and the $1200 a month I give her for rent and bills.   She is literally making it more difficult for me to be separated, than it would be to be married.  See where this is going yet?...   I think she is trying to make my life so hard while being separated, that I will get back together with her and she is pissed that I am actually moving into the basement instead of back with her upstairs.   I am stuck.  I have a contract with her saying that I will cover the cost of the basement being finished over the next 2 years ($20,000).  We also have an agreement that I will continue to pay her child support while she is in school for the next two years.  I also love my kids more than anything in the entire world, and I can see that me living there is the best thing for them. They are so happy having both Jane and I around, along with their uncle.   I just have no idea what to do.  Either way I lose.     If I stay in the basement, I am miserable in that I have to deal with a crazy, selfish, irrational, and highly volatile person every day.  At least now I can go out occasionally, talk to girls, and whatever else (but cannot bring anyone home, and sustain a healthy relationship with any girl). I get to see my kids though, which is my #1 priority.   If I stay married, I still deal with that, but I save a lot of money.  On the other hand though, I am not happy.  Again, here I have my kid’s every day.   I move out, finish the divorce, and suck up the $20,000.  I am “poor,” I don’t get to see my kids as often, but I am happy in the fact that I don’t have to deal with her as often and have some freedom.  Although, I would have to for all the divorce stuff, and the kids.     My plan right now is to spend the next two years dealing with her, save up some money, and then go from there.  My kids will both be in school; Jane will have her degree and hopefully be in a better place. That way I can move on with my life and know that I at least tried to do the right thing for everyone.  But I need help or I am going to going insane over the course of the next two years.   Please help with any advice so I do not end up in mental institution.
A little back story...   I've known this girl for a few years now and she's a 10 across the board. She makes me laugh, my smiles are wider when I'm with her, our intimate moments come with feelings I can't remember ever having before, and her physical form is that of a super model. She literally has... It... All.   Over the past few years, she's been in a relationship with a dipstick that has emotionally and physically abused her. she has 3 kids (not his), has little work experience because she spent her whole life (since she was 16) taking care of them. I never thought she was going to leave this dude, but I knew her situation. She hated this guy but timing had to be on her side or else she would leave her kids without a place to go. We hooked up a few times while this was going on and then I ended up moving out of state a year or so ago but we periodically talked so to keep our connection.   Fast forward to now....   SHE LEFT THE DUDE!!! her and the kids finally got a place in my small home town and she is finally able to get her life back... Sort of.   The three kids are constantly pulling at her; the 17yo is now smoking weed, the 14yo is constantly out with friends and needing money, and the 10yo is bouncing off the walls in need of attention.   She says she wants me, hell, she shows it. When she sees me out in public she come to me and kisses me, she holds my hand and we share a conversation. It's like there's something that can happen but our lives are separated in such a way that it would take a lot of work.   Now, I'm a photographer who's trying to pursue a career in travel photography/photojournalism (think Steve McCurry). I just got back from India a few weeks ago from a stretch time to wander and shoot. I'm headed back over there in a few weeks to continue my passion and work on a few projects in hopes someone in the industry will take notice and grant me the opportunity to work assignments.   I've been torn up about this because the other night we had the most amazing night ever. We went out with a few of my friends, she was pulling her weight in some great conversation, getting along with my people and then we come back to her house after a few drinks. This is where our magic happen. We had some of the best sex we've ever had for like an hour and spent the next hour or so cuddling and pillow talking before falling asleep.   I bring this part up because the kind of intimacy we shared that night gave me feelings I can't recount with any other relationship and I know I'm falling super hard for her.   I am just at a huge loss in my head and heart right now because I have an 11/10 wanting my heart but I have my dreams to chase.   I don't know what to do Reddit...
So over the last year I've started smoking and I've met these amazing new friends and they have become my family just like you guys  :)   I've been saving all of the best nuggest I've gotten from all of my best bags over the last year and I've been saving them for an end of the year smoke session. I've got Buddha Kush, Chronic, Blue Dream, and many many more. I'll keep you updated with pictures as we go along! I'm setting up right now!!   We're going to roll a 4.2 gram blunt and will have 3 MFLB's here since two of the 7 people have asthma. They all think they're coming over for just a regular smoke session and have no idea what I have in store for all of them! I bought nice bottled beer, have pizza and 2 litres gallor! I've got Gorillaz, Dr. Dre, and Bob Marley set on the playlist and ready to go!   :D I'm so excited! I made this a self post so I wont get karma but this will be the night to top all nights!! We arent doing it on new years because we all have family obligations
My system sounds the same running Infamous as it does running TLOU:R. It's not silent, you can hear the fan, but that's normal. With the game volume up you shouldn't really be able to hear it. If you can, there's something likely wrong on your system (thermal paste breaking down/poor thermal contact..etc.)   Last night my buds came over and we played TLOU:R and had two PS4s going at the same time both in a well ventilated area on top of a cabinet next to one another. We could hear the systems when the scene in game was near silent, but not after that.
I was driving down a fairly busy 4 lane road in my city, 2 lanes each way.  It was dusk, so everyone had their headlights on, but it was still kind of light out, making it hard to see.  A family is walking down the street on my right side, there must have been 4 of them with really young kids, maybe 4 and 8.  I'm driving with 3 of my friends in the car, I don't remember what we were going to do that evening.  Anyway, I notice the family is yelling toward the street, I think it odd, but continue on my way.  I'm in the center lane on my side, so I have traffic on either side.   After I pass the family I notice what they were yelling at, a small black dog obscured by the dusk light and light bursts from the headlights of oncoming cars.  I only saw it for a split second before it crossed the line from the oncoming traffic into my lane.  There was nothing I could do, I noticed it had a baby blue collar on right before I felt it go under my tire.  As my car bumped I heard the children scream.  I drive a little further down and find a place to turn around.  I go back after about 5 minutes and the dog is gone, the family is gone, there is no sign of injury except for the dent in my bumper.  I like to think the dog ran away after that, but I highly doubt it.  I didn't even get a chance to apologize to a family.
So just to preface. This is probably gonna end up more as a rant than a question but oh well. Feel free to skip to the end for the actual question and sorry this is so long :p   This past January I decided to get really serious about youtube and started doing a lot more with my channel and interacting with this sub and twitter and the like. I've also been trying to get better at SEO (I'm far from perfect)  But then I've just been hit by a slew of problems.   First was not being able to record certain games for no reason I could find. After testing our all sort of different settings and programs I was finally able to get them.   Then was a recording I did with someone that my computer nicely decided I didn't actually want.   Then my controller somehow breaking even more and not having the money to replace it considering besides a few buttons getting slightly stiff still works.   Then my computer deciding it may have a broken hard drive all of a sudden. Right after I decided my money would be best used on a new extra one for other purposes   Then there's been a bunch of smaller issues like me getting sick and messing up a week's worth of recordings and noticing way too late. And even just deciding that I can't make a good video right now and trashing what I was doing for quality sake. And all the other problems and difficulties that come with making videos for youtube.   I'm not saying that these problems aren't fixable or even too hard to prevent but with such a slew of them hitting over such a short period and right after fixing one thing and feeling good about going to record. It gets more and more discouraging. Especially because I love to make videos and interact with people in this medium but all these tech issues that I keep having to stop and try to fix makes the act of actually making videos so much harder. I do believe that you should make any video to your best ability always and this makes it so much more difficult. I'm not gonna stop making videos. My goal for February is to bring in more viewers and subscribers and start promoting and cracking down on my SEO and getting better in all those regards. But it's still a real pain to deal with. And just a constant major annoyance.   Sorry for being so long and ranty. I'm just wondering if anyone else can relate or has had similar experiences.
ITT some races don't know the difference between being black and being a nigga. One makes your life difficult, one means you are life is a cluster f*ck of bad decisions and paths.

Why don't you just introduce some god damned legislation guns. Seriously. Oh look we have had some school shootings. Lets give the teachers guns! Because nothing could  ever  go wrong with that. And don't give me that its our freedom or it won't get rid of all guns crap. Over here we need a licence and a backround check to even rent a gun with blank shots and right to carry a device with no practical purpose other than inflicting grievous and intentionally fatal wounds shouldn't be a thing. In this day and age you do not need a gun to defend yourself and making them easy to get your hands on doesn't help you defend you it just aggravates the problem by putting guns in peoples hands easily. Remember how in the cold war it was they have nukes therefore we should have bigger nukes? Its the same mentality and no it does not mean you are safe and no it wont make the world a safer place. Only more dangerous.
I was/am the same way honestly.  I used to watch porn almost exclusively with middle aged men.  When it came time to date people, I couldn't bring myself to date older men for whatever reason, and I discovered that age doesn't really matter to me anymore.  I can be just as attracted to people my own age as I was to older men.
My boyfriend and I are very happy. There's just one thing about our relationship that kind of bugs me- He never really seems to tell me about things he's doing or has planned.   Last week I was texting him to see if he wanted to grab lunch, and he said "Sorry it took so long to text back, I'm at a wake." I thought that was kind of a big thing to not bring up at some point. It was for a great aunt who he wasn't terribly close to, but still, a death in the family is usually something that comes up in conversation with your girlfriend.   Today I wanted to make plans for Saturday, and he told me he was going out of state for several days. It's a bit bigger of a trip to plan in two days, so I wondered why he didn't tell me before.   Before anyone thinks anything: I trust this man completely, I love him and I'm sure he loves me. We are super happy. This is just one weird thing that I've noticed, and I have a few past insecurities from other relationships. I'm not worried he's sneaking around on me, I'm not about to break up with him over this tiny thing, I just wonder why he doesn't feel the need to tell me things like that. Is it okay for this to kind of bug me? Is there a reason guys do this?   By all means, tell me if I'm being neurotic.
A nation is a group of people unified by some common trait such as language, cumture, or history with no geographical requirement. Usually, they're small sects. Think the Kurds who want to create Kurdistan. If they succeed, that would be a nation state, which is a state created on the basis of a common cultural identity. Nations can exist without a state or without a ruling governmental body over them. They can be a wandering people, like the Jews in biblical times.   On the other hand, a state is a group of people whose dominant trait in common is that they are united under a common political entity over them. There is usually a geographical tie in, as governments, save colonial systems, tend to encompass a finite area. Most states aren't true nation states, although some do exist.   Liberia is a conglomeration of indigenous groups, immigrants, refugees, and generations descended from African colonialism, unified only by the fact that they live under the same government. They do not share a common language nor religion. Although the official language is English, more than 30 indigenous languages persist. Also, more than 80% of the country is Christian, but there is also a large Muslim population, with indigenous religions coming in a distant third.   In the vernacular they're interchangeable. But I had it drilled in to me so often in college that it's become a pet peeve.   Edit:
Hi reddit,   I was on Ritalin and then Rubifen(sane thing,different brand) as a way to control my ADHD, Dyslexia and help me concentration from about 6 or 7 years of age and came off in my first year of high school but came off due to the stigma the medication.   I am now 17(allmost 18) and studying in my final year of high school with hopes of uni next year. Unlike the rest of my high school years there is a massive homework load and im am really struggling to coupe in and out of class and feel that it may be a benefit going back on medication.   When I originally went on i had to go to several 'specialists' and things like that but now I am older i was wondering what is involved with going back on the medication?   Thanks   Ps: sorry about grammar/spelling mistakes.
Just to put it out there, I'm gay. I've had 2 boyfriends within last 7 years. He's never dated anyone before.   We hit it off really well. I thought it was just gonna be a quick Starbucks date, but ended up talking for five hours. We walked around the river bank and then watched some tv at my place. We made out on the couch and it felt amazing (no sex though).   He's a really nice guy but I noticed that he hasn't really texted me unless I text him first. It's kinda weird because we talked so much in person. His new job started today so maybe that's taking his time, but in general, how often does a man text their date?
I wasn't really sure where to put this, so I'll put it here. Just a heads up.   Years ago I made a FaceBook account (I've never had one beforehand) that was fake and I used it to get free currencies on mobile games. It's still logged into my Safari on my iPhone even though I never use it. I signed up under a Russian city by typing random characters into the 'location' bar.   I have Instagram, and with it, a personal account. Now, I've been running into a lot of Russian advertisements for things such as Nike, Adidas, and Duracell (all in Russian, saying 'Sponsored') I've never actually linked my two accounts together ever, I have never downloaded the FaceBook app either.
That struck me hard as well. The posting parents are probably not happy with their life. It's not as if they took a look at the baby and decided that it's horrible cause it has autism. They're going through it, living it 24/7. It's not as if they're gleefully jumping up and down, proclaiming their dislike/hate for their children.   Sure, there are plenty of autistic/ADHD people who're wonderful, gifted, smart and pretty" normal" whatever that is. But there are also those who're absolutely horrible, who can't function  at all . I've worked with teenagers  and  adults in the autism spectrum and sweet baby Jesus.. The parents.   Some were happy, others were tired/depressed. And others were counting down the days til either themselves or their kids would die. I especially remember one man in his early 60's. He had severe issues. Despite lots of work, encouragement and training he could not function. At all. His mother was in her late 80's. She had spent her whole damn life on that kid. When he was young there were few resources/places where he could be. She had to deal with it.   She loved her son, but she said she'd be way happier if he had died.   Not all cases were as severe as this, but
I'm about to go to bed, but one key event of my childhood was something I spent a good seven years ashamed of.   I was on Junior Mastermind.   My topic? The History of the English Longbow. Now, looking back, I was hilarious. I had a blonde mohawk, glasses, bad teeth, I'm surprised the daft fuckers let me on. I hadn't studied jack shit for it, and everything went wrong on the day. We had to get me new clothes as the ones we brought had logos on it, and my two bestmates were there to see me fail miserably. I got ten points out of two rounds. Most people generally score between 20 and 30. In the middle of, I believe, the second round - I started to cry. I realised I was fucked, basically. I was going to lose, and badly, too. They took me out and sat me outside, and my Mum - who I maintain is an Angel in human form - said that I could go home...or I could keep going. I returned, got three more points, sat in a chair trying not to cry, and then went home.   For seven years, I doubted my intelligence. I physically hit people for mentioning it. I was bullied for it in High School. I had failed. The keystone of my confidence was my mind, and it had been ripped to pieces. I failed. I went up, and my fifteen minutes of fame was to be a joke, a failure.   But recently, I've started to realise how fortunate I was. Because of that horrible day, I'm a determined fucker. I don't give up until I've had the shit kicked out of me. When I joined the OTC, I instantly felt out of place in the Army, and I hated every minute of it, but I kept going for six months. When I got into a fight with the BIGGEST, NASTIEST guy in our year, I went down still punching him in the face. Because of JM, I value determination. But I also value preparation. Now, I admit I'm not brilliant at it. My last exams I went into, for UNIVERSITY, I barely revised. But for hiking trips, for outtings, for anything, I prepare like nothing else.   And I suppose I should get to your second one. How did I get past it? Well, for one thing, it's not that big. I doubt, if everyone who ever saw that episode read this post, that any would be able to pick me out in the street. I cocked up on TV eight years ago. No one gives a fuck. But that was after I realised that it's taught me to fight. That it's ok to fail, that it's ok to get knocked down once in a while. Whether it be your education or your morals, everyone makes mistakes. What matters is you get back on the horse. If I could go back and stop myself from going on that show, I wouldn't. It made me who I am today, and I like me.
I did a search, and nothing came up. So I figured I might as well share this, since everyone and their mothers are sharing their various "cheese" strats.   In the Gorgon's Maze, as soon as you do the leap of faith, or drop in from above the left chest, take everyone together as a group to get the right chest. As soon as everyone has gotten both chests, everyone except one person will drop group.   That one person has a very, very easy job on normal, or on hard.   That person will wipe once everyone leaves, and immediately upon spawning he will jump over the rock in front of the spawn, and follow the little stream on the right up until he sees the first Gorgon, that Gorgon will patrol to the left and as soon as he's facing away from you, follow that stream straight forward.   You will come to a rock that basically looks like a small wall you can hide behind, jump over that "wall" and immediately run forward and to the left. Here you will see a giant rock pillar directly in front of you. Jump on top of it, and then jump to the next pillar to your left.   Once you're on top of that pillar follow it up to the top, and jump to the next pillar to your left. From there jump straight forward to the next cliff, and look to your right, you'll see the four pillars, on hard mode once of the Gorgon patrols to the left of the pillars you have to wait for the Gorgon underneath you to patrol right. As soon as he patrols right, double jump straight to the exit and go through it.   Once you're at the jumping puzzle, everyone rejoins and they're spawned at the puzzle.
Most disappointing for me too. I will never sell it because I am having a lot of fun now and expect it to get even better(hopefully), but I don't think I'll preorder Halo 5 and most other games. I also preordered Destiny and was hyped as fuck for that and was livid when I completed the storyline and was like " that's it ?" but my friend convinced me to keep it and I haven't played it past the first month. At least I didn't get Watch Dogs.
If you're talking the crazy "RUN TEH DRIVOR KLENZOR OR BOX GO BOOM" then I agree completely, but if you're talking about not checking "Perform Clean Install" checkbox then I have to point out that you're missing the whole point of using an updated driver; updated game profiles.   The Fresh Installation option deletes the previous game profiles (registry and matching xml files) and replaces it with the most current version.  When Nvidia 'optimise' a game they make changes to those xml files to tell the driver to set certain flags and such to make best use of the hardware.  When those xml files aren't updated to match the driver installed the games will run but not at their best.
Significant other is highly against drugs. She classifies weed in this category. I said I stopped smoking bowls, but I still smoke that shit  everyday. My plan is to hide it forever. Is it possible? Or will I eventually be fucked? Has anyone else had a similar experience? Need advice.   The reason S/O is so against it is because a family friend who used to smoke weed also started doing all this other shit. Really fucked themselves up. She is just simply not tolerant of it.
Hi all, this may be a long post, so I'm sorry in advance.   I have only really known about poly for just under a year. The idea really intrigued me, so decided that I wanted to try it. I dated a few people with an 'open relationship' status, but it was never easy, as they had no or little experience with such a thing, and the mono-mindset is very prominent in most people (as we all know).   I decided, after a string of half-assed relationships (because of my insistence on being nonmonogamous), that I would be mono again to develop something real.   I met Joe in January, and our first date was the best I've ever had. We connected on many things and had a lot of common interests. He also brought up open relationships/polyamory (on the first date!) as something that he thought "made sense" (he is an extremely logical/rational person). I was very excited to hear this. I told him my story, but we agreed we definitely wanted to do the mono thing first.   A bit about Joe:     He is  very  intelligent. He is also very attractive. He values his intelligence, and does not feel especially proud to be considered an attractive person.     He is demisexual (no physical attraction without an emotional/intellectual connection). This is the biggest limiting factor in his dating life. Before he met me, he had been single for over 4 years.     He is introverted and does not especially care to make new friends (or relationships).       We are both in our mid-20s, and both heterosexual. I am a little bicurious, but not very sexually attracted to women.   Anyway...   The more time has gone on, and the more the topic of 'an open relationship' has come up, it's more clear to me that he isn't actually interested in opening our relationship at all.  Last night we had a long and revealing talk about it, and stated how we both felt about the idea of opening the relationship.   My feelings:     Joe would be my primary (implying that he would be my preferred partner, and our relationship would be the strongest)     I would be able to enjoy flirting with men (I have always really enjoyed flirting), and maybe more     If I found someone that I connected with, and all parties were consenting (Joe included), I might start seeing him.     I would actively encourage Joe to connect with more women (though the only woman I have ever had him admit any interest in is his ex girlfriend).     I believe that my love / affection / attraction is not a finite resource, and I can gladly give it to multiple people. Giving affection / attention to a new person would not make my love for Joe any less.       Joe's feelings:     Joe feels that he only needs one partner, and has expressed that if he had a desire to find another, it would be an exercise in efficiency: he would be trying to find a  better  partner.     If I did anything with another person (not Joe), Joe would as a result feel detached from me. Our bond, to him, would feel weakened.     He has sort of broken down and agreed that he  would  try it, but our relationship would then hold more of a status of "friends with benefits" in his mind.       I want a serious relationship, and I want a partner who would be excited to let me experience other men. I know a lot of mono men would find this idea outrageous. Joe is very resistant and can't relate to my (poly) way of thinking.   He has said more than once that his feelings about it may change over time. I've told him that I would be willing to stay mono for a long time (~2 years?) if it meant we could eventually open up the relationship, even temporarily.   The whole idea just doesn't seem to compute with him.   I feel guilty, because in most people's minds, the fact that I'm pushing this idea means that he is not enough for me / i'm not happy with just him. I am often attracted to other people, and I dislike the idea of never being able to act on these feelings ever again, because of a long-term monogamous relationship. To him, I can understand that this would just seem like an excuse to be slutty (though he has never said anything like that) and have fun.   What do you think? Have any of you experienced anything similar? Is there anything I can say to him that might make him take the idea a little more seriously?
You don't look too bad after that surgery. Skin heals pretty fast, I remember once peeling half the skin off my forehead. You wouldn't know today if I showed you. Mostly because I keep my hair long, but also because it healed without leaving a mark.   The only thing that gives it away over time is that a patch of your skin is lighter than the rest. Doesn't matter if it's a skin graft, a rotational skin flap or if just "grows" back on its own. The skin is going to be of a lighter color where it got ripped off. Even thought after a few months you need a keen eye to spot it if you don't already know it's there.   Congrats for making it through this. Have a beer to celebrate. Contact MGM and offer them to play a vilain in the next Bond movie. Take a couple of photos with a wild, angry look. Tell your friends you got in a fight, and brush away the scars like they're nothing serious, that your opponent is going to need a lot more reconstructive surgery.
So this was about a year ago but I guess y'all don't mind if it was today or 4 years ago.  Anywho, my now ex-girlfriend and I had been dating for about a year and a half (15-16yo) and wanted to start getting more into it. She lives about 35 minutes away and I didn't have a car yet so Skype is the natural way to go. Right?...  So we are chatting it up and I use Skype on our computer when I game with friends and must have left it open. So the whole time me and her are sexy talking, my dad is reading the messages, mortified.  I was just about to send a pic and my dad bursted in my room, and started yelling at me about this. Mind you I'm 100% naked with my hand on my flagpole.  My phone was then confiscated and I couldn't talk to her for a few weeks. Next time we hung out we banged and it was freaking awesome.
She has a boyfriend. She doesn't mind hanging out with you but don't expect anything other than coffee.   Unless she cheats on him and then don't expect anything other than her doing the same to you when you guys are in a relationship.
The title pretty well says it all, but I need something I can make. My relationship is coming to its 3rd year and I pretty well do the same thing every year. I decided to change things up and make her something wrestling themed but I can't think of anything good enough to make me proud of myself. So I'm asking my fellow wredditors for help. I would like to make her special gift(s) with her favorite wrestlers (CM Punk, Dean Ambrose, Roman Regins, Paige, and ultimately AJ). What can I make that can make me a great boyfriend?
first year surgery resident here. got married right before i started medical school and had a kid 2 weeks into residency. your concerns are reasonable but should not stop you from pursuing a career in medicine. Medical school can be very tough, academically, but you will have a significant amount of time away from actual classes in which to organize the rest of your life. The challenge comes in doing that effectively.   You need to understand that there will be certain expectations that you must meet in order to succeed in medical school and others that you will need to meet in order to have a happy relationship. Striking that balance is, i think, the true challenge of medical school and really any demanding professional endeavor.   As i've started residency my life has simplified. work, study, family make up 90% of my time. sleep, hobbies, friends make up the rest. that's the way it has to be and i don't regret it for a second.   Life is going to continue for both you and your significant other while you're in med school and in residency. At each step there are challenges that you will have to deal with but really it's no different than any other relationship that is stressed by circumstance. the same rules apply too: communicate, compromise when possible, empathize when not possible and appreciate the other person for who they are.   I've found having a significant other, and now a child, to be a source of strength. it helps me realize that there is an existence outside of work and it keeps me grounded while i'm in the hospital.   PM me if you have questions.
He's bloody great. I have a Spanish cousin living in France (We get around..) so we talk about football, and I try and watch some French football so we can discuss it.   What I'm trying to say is yes. He's also quite strong, which in the prem is always needed to an extent. I'm not sure how to explain it but he's patient, doesn't dive into tackles and picks the right moment to cleanly take the ball and mug the striker off.   Seeing as we've made contact and he's got all these positive things to say, I'd be surprised if we didn't sign him in the summer. Great asset, honestly don't think he'd need to go out on loan.
In the 6th grade, I was put into an enrichment program for "gifted" kids, which would last two weeks. During said program, the kids would get together in groups and perform various intellectual challenges. I became friends with a really cute girl in my group, and at the end of the program, she invited me over to her house for a BBQ. Suffice to say I really enjoyed her company, and wanted to go, but my mother forbade me from hanging out with her because she isn't Chinese. I've had a thing for white girls, blondes especially, ever since.
Hey guys this is my first post to this sub, so sorry if I mess up the formatting a bit!   I work for a big grocery store chain as a cashier.  The other day we were packed because of the pre-Superbowl-rush and nearly every order I had was at least $150, often going way over.  This man and his wife were one of the orders that went way over (roughly $500 or so), and as such their cart was pretty much overflowing.   I could already tell that these guys weren't exactly polite, since every time I tried to talk to them I was met with either silence or short utterances.  Guess I don't exist, eh?  Anyhow, I went to scan the numerous items under the cart with my scan gun, and while I was down there, the husband, who was behind the cart, slowly started moving the cart forward.   At my store, there is a type of metal island behind each of the registers designed to hold bags of groceries, re-shops, and whatever else you may like, even with a space underneath with garbage and recycling containers.  What this guy didn't realize was that his cart had minimized the space for me to exit between the island and the cart.   As I was finishing up, I heard him ask me to scan something in his hand.  I went to look at what he had/get up and ended up smacking the back of my head against the metal island on a rounded edge. Audibly.  I made eye contact with the guy as it happened, and what does he say?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  No "Are you ok?", no looks of concern or guilt over having caused the lump on my head.  He just stared at me and waited for me to scan the item in his hand.  I waited the entire rest of the order to see if he would say anything, and not even his wife (who was standing next to me the entire time) said something.   The bruise still hurts.
First off, this is my first time making a thread, so I'm probably going to screw up the title formatting.   In a nutshell: Bruce is the Devil and Wilfred is a demon. Let me explain.   Wilfred and Bruce have a pastime of screwing with each other. This is very similar to devils and demons in mythology being portrayed as tricksters and deceptive beings. A stretch to say they're a devil and demon, respectively? Maybe. But in Season 3 (I honestly can't remember the name of the episode), Wilfred tells Ryan that Bruce is a "snake". He then literally describes Bruce as being a snake. Obviously I'm making a biblical connection. At first I didn't think twice at this, but another user pointed out in a thread that Ryan sees Bruce in his garden. Coincidence?   Wilfred also claims to have no knowledge of why Ryan can see him. He could be lying, but what if he isn't? What if Bruce somehow erased Wilfred's memory? He planted the memories of a dog into Wilfred as part of some weird prank (and the same thing happened to Ryan's mom's cat-lady friend). Now Wilfred literally believes he's a dog but he infact is a demon with demonic powers. Which takes me to my greatest piece of evidence (which is still pretty flimsy).   In the pilot episode, Wilfred and Ryan both unknowingly strike a Faustian bargain. Ryan makes a deal with a demon and neither he nor the demon are aware of it. The title should redirect to the YouTube video I uploaded, if not [here it is]( The language is kind of iffy, but what basically happened is that Ryan agreed to "help" Wilfred, and in exchange, Wilfred must stay away from him forever.   It's interesting to note that the [original script]( is even more convincing. If you look on page 28, Ryan specifically says "Here's the deal". Some of you are probably thinking "But they didn't actually shake on it!". But if you watch Supernatural, you know that a demonic deal doesn't have to be sealed with a handshake. As far as I know, there's no set-in-stone way to seal a deal. Simply saying it may have done it.   Now let's disect the deal: "I'll help you, then you have to stay away from me. Forever."   So why didn't Wilfred have to leave Ryan after he helped him get the ball? Actually, I don't think they ever actually retrieved the ball. Wilfred broke into that guy's house. I'll edit it after I watch the episode again. Even if they did get the ball, maybe the wording of the bargain was so vague that it didn't count. Maybe there's something big that Ryan has to help Wilfred, and then Wilfred will learn he's a demon and leave Ryan forever.   What about the drawing and the weird dog-man figurine? How did Ryan's dad know?   Occam's razor would suggest that Bruce (aka the Devil) set it all up. But if I used Occam's razor, I would say that all of this is just a product of Ryan's mental illness. We know that Wilfred has been around since at least Ryan's childhood. Maybe the statue thing was created by a cultist, I dunno (that symbol looked occult). I really don't know how to explain this stuff. I'm still a little lost on all the details of the picture. First Ryan thought he drew it, then Kristen. Maybe she saw Wilfred as a man when she was a kid, but then he became like a regular dog to her, and now Ryan sees him as a man.
New to this so explain posting to imgur for me :/ Had the game since day 1. 100% since week one and have been searching the entire time. Only reason I've never posted is because I've had no leads or breakthroughs to post, and my theories have led to nothing. So I was going through story mode for a second time, now taking in all the info I could, and I found this:  text reads "dead midgets" and "take photos for xmas cards :)" and the next sticky note says "553-555-(00?)72 call for more information." I know we already have a list of phone numbers we can call, but was wondering if anyone could take another look for a similar number? It isn't on reddit's list. And a new, irrelevent kind of out there theory I just started working on. Those gnomes. the goddamned gnomes. A while back, screwing around the game, I came across one of those garden gnomes you see around the game world, mostly places you will visit during missions that are right in front of you, but still easy to miss. I kicked it dead and my game brought the autosave option up. I saved the game, loaded it up and the gnome was gone. Tried it on other gnomes ( The starlet's house and I think Lester's?) same thing happened, thought it was odd but couldn't make a connection. A few months go by, and I've gone fucking insane trying to find the whatever it is we're all looking for. anyway I started reading up on mt Shasta and the Lemurians, Atlanteans, and underground cities a recent post brought back from the dead, and for some reason the gnomes just popped into my head. I'm trying to make a connection lol, but all I can think of is that gnomes live underground and in mountains, right? And they're statues, watching, like the eye. Then I came across some website attacking Richard Steiner for his Waldorf Schools google.com/site/waldorfwatch/gnomes... I'm really high... I made a connection but forgot where I was going. Probably straw-grasping. But the phone number seems like it could lead somewhere. I've already tried it in-game and real world to no avail, maybe I have the number wrong?
Welcome to Stat Porn Sunday where we look at completely-safe-for-work content still likely to get you riled (shoutout to /u/obsidianchao for the naming inspiration).   Follow the link if you want to see last week's stat:  [Stat Sunday:  Weapon Pairings in Crucible](   Given the interest taken in [the post made]( by /u/MKerrsive yesterday, I thought it would be appropriate to make this Stat Porn Sunday about weapon usage in the Iron Banner.   Everyone cares deeply about their weapons, and I think the general outcry against the upcoming weapon tuning is reasonable.  /u/MKerrsive set out to analyze data in order to explain why the weapon tuning is being implemented.  Bungie's explanation didn't sit right with him ([or me either]( and he's doing some awesome work, but there is still one metric that I don't think has been considered yet.   Before we dive in to the data, let me describe the dataset that I used and the potential biases in it.  I grabbed over 8,000 games worth of data from the last Iron Banner.  Unfortunately, due to the sampling method I used and the way the API is set up, most of these games are from the last 3 days of Iron Banner.  While I don't think weapon usage changes significantly from day to day, it is a bias in the data.  The other bias is that this data only covers Xbox One users, so there will be no mention of PSN exclusives here.   Now for the fun part.  Here is a graph of the [Top 20 Weapons By Kills in Iron Banner](   Surprise!  The top weapon is Thorn.  This differs from the graph Bungie posted in their weekly update because my graph looks at all weapon types, unlike Bungie's which only looked at primaries.  Still the trend is obvious.  Thorn kills almost twice as many people as the next weapon.  Also worth noting is that only 8 of the top weapons are primary weapons (and there are 0 fusion rifles up there) and that the top 20 weapons account for  69.89%  of all weapon kills.   So that probably wasn't actually surprising for anyone.  This next part might be. Just because Thorn is the most used, doesn't mean it's overpowered.  It is certainly an  indication  that Thorn is more powerful, but it is not definitive proof. What we really need to do is look at how  effective  the weapon is.  When I think of effectiveness, I think of the weapon's ability to kill players in relation to other weapons.  Simply killing  more  is not enough.  Another metric is needed.   There are probably several ways of doing this, but the stat that I created is Kills-Per-Player (KPP).  I took the total number of kills for each weapon and then divided that by the number of people using it.  By "using it", I mean the number of players who had at least 1 kill with the weapon.  Basically, it tries to removes the bias due to the majority of players using only a small subset of the weapon base.   Look at this graph (or read the table below if that's more your speed.) [Kills Per Player for the 20 Most Used Weapons](       Weapon Name   Players Using   Total Kills   Frequency   Kills Per Player           The Last Word   14532   72319   0.089612   4.976535         The Messenger (Adept)   1887   9292   0.011514   4.924218         Thorn   29062   137044   0.169815   4.715574         Vex Mythoclast   4067   18956   0.023489   4.660929         Red Death   11391   53000   0.065674   4.652796         Bad Juju   2241   9804   0.012148   4.374833         MIDA Multi-Tool   3153   13318   0.016503   4.223914         SUROS Regime   2264   9490   0.011759   4.191696         Invective   1984   8261   0.010236   4.16381         Ice Breaker   2369   9536   0.011816   4.025327         Felwinter's Lie   9222   36173   0.044823   3.922468         Matador 64   12816   49786   0.061691   3.884675         Judgment VI   2730   10364   0.012842   3.796337         Party Crasher +1   12147   45606   0.056512   3.754507         Her Courtesy   2584   8343   0.010338   3.228715         BTRD-345   7273   22582   0.027982   3.104909         Jolder's Hammer   4831   14411   0.017857   2.983026         Found Verdict   6101   18081   0.022405   2.963613         Praedyth's Revenge   2980   8777   0.010876   2.945302         Radegast's Fury   3564   8910   0.011041   2.5           That's right.  Thorn does not have the highest Kills Per Player, because Thorn isn't the beast we  perceive  it to be.  What we expect from a well balanced game is not that there is the same number of kills for each weapon, but that the Kills Per Player is the same.  The fact is that Destiny is more balanced than we believe.  Sorting them by decreasing KPP actually clusters the weapons by primary and secondary.  The top 8 are primaries, followed by 7 secondaries and then a cluster of secondaries and heavies.  You can see that the KPP is actually fairly balanced within each cluster.   Now that graph only shows the KPP for the top 20 most used weapons, not the weapons with the top KPP.  That's because KPP suffers as a metric when there isn't enough data.  Strange Suspect actually has the highest KPP (according to my data) because it has 90 kills across 14 players giving it a KPP of about 6.6.  Almost 40% greater than Thorn, but no one is complaining about Strange Suspect.   The point is, we have a perception problem, and the graph that Bungie posted in the weekly update didn't exactly help matters (it is literally the causation of /u/MKerssive's post).  I have made graphs that fed the perception and others have too, but Thorn isn't the monster we make it out to be.  That's probably why Bungie isn't doing a Thorn specific nerf.  There doesn't need to be one.  Bungie is using their own metrics to evaluate weapons and are making changes accordingly.   One last graph that I think seals the deal: [Victory Rate with Top 20 Weapons](   People who use Thorn win 50% of their games.  People who use MIDA win 50% of their games.  Guess what?  Doesn't matter.  The spikes on heavy weapons is actually interesting.  I think this has more to do with the general statement that player's who get heavy kills are more likely to win than those who don't.  But even the victory rate with the heavy weapons is pretty much the same.   So if you're rocking Thorn, maybe it's time to branch out.  You aren't doing any better than the rest of us.
I understand that Nintendo has done very well with hardware sales in the past and I'm sure that they will continue to, but don't people buy their consoles almost exclusively for their content? Obviously, there are other reasons to buy their console, but anytime I ever hear of someone buying a Wii over an Xbox or PS3 it's because they want to play Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Donkey Kong, Smash, Pokemon, Pikmin, etc.   Now, this isn't that different for the PS3 or Xbox. Lot's of people choose one or the other because of their first party titles which are very important to a console's success. However, and maybe I'm alone in thinking this, but aren't Nintendo's IP completely lacking future potential? That is to say, for the last two consoles by Nintendo (Wii and Wii U) as well as their handhelds (DS and 3DS) they have gone to extreme lengths in order to avoid advancing their hardware in the same path as Sony and MS. They invent new control schemes and gimmicks in order to attract gamers instead of simply using better hardware. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it has attracted many first-time gamers and so far proven successful for them.   But the major problem, is how will Nintendo IP fare 5 years from now? 10 years from now? 15 years from now? Etc. They can keep dawdling behind Sony and MS in terms of hardware power, but their IP has remained relatively unchanged for decades now. This means that while their IP is still popular, classic, and in demand, what happens in the future? When the Wii 3 is released even it will need to improve the hardware on the Wii 2. But, how fucking smooth can they make Mario's character lines before hardware advancements are redundant? Same for almost all of Nintendo's IP which were designed in an era where power was scarce. Metroid might be an exception which, being based on real people, has the potential to keep looking better. But DK, Mario, Star Fox, Kirby, Pokemon, etc are all cartoon-based IP that can only look so good (IMO). While Sony is showing a photorealistic Nathan Drake, Kratos, Snake, Final Fantasy, etc. all complete with increasingly intelligent AI and luscious environments on their PS4, 5, etc., Nintendo is stuck with an ultra smooth cartoon plumber fighting increasingly intelligent mushrooms (???), which only walk back and forth in one direction.   I'm not saying I don't enjoy Nintendo IP. Everyone loves a good Mario remake once in a while, but Nintendo has shown over the past few decades a commitment to their cartoon IP unlike any of their more modern IP. And you can't blame them, it's incredibly successful and lucrative so far. But because the most important games on their systems are those that require very little system power, there is little desire to improve the hardware at all and to continue with gimmicky innovation. By not maintaining this path, they cut themselves off from 3rd party developers creating games for the similar Xbox and Playstation platforms. This was a big problem for the Wii (despite good sales) and I think will be a huge problem for the Wii U once the next generation rolls out next year.   Which brings me full circle. Would Nintendo not be more successful as a 3rd party developer for Sony, MS, Apple, Android, etc? I can't imagine someone owning a Nintendo console without at least 1 Nintendo franchise (if not exclusively Nintendo IP). Their game sales would include all of their current customers, in addition the the customers that they have alienated on the PS and Xbox (because if you want to be a modern gamer and keep up with new IP, you need either an Xbox or a PS). As far as I know, software sales are where Sony, MS, and Nintendo make the bulk of their money with consoles either being sold at a loss, or a very tiny profit. And if they're only making games for other systems, there is no need to worry about the hardware. They have as much power as they need to flesh out Luigi and DK and it won't matter if there is surplus power. People will still play cartoony games on an advanced platform (Ratchet/Clank and LittleBigPlanet are a testament to that), but their gamer market will grow vastly larger as their characters are so popular that I'd bet at least one Nintendo game in every household with a system.   I wouldn't be asking this if Nintendo had shown any strong indication to conform to the gaming market and either release more universal hardware for third parties to work with, or to develop more modern IP, but they just haven't shown that to me at all. And while I hate to be  that guy , what happens in the future where the parents of tomorrow's children didn't just grow up with Mario and company? When kids are no longer introduced to Mario by their parents (who will have grown up with different games), what happens to Nintendo's target audience? Right now, even my grandmother knows Mario, but she couldn't tell you who Master Chief or Sackboy are. And if Sackboy is still kicking when my kids are born and growing up, then you can bet that's who I'd introduce them to.   Don't misunderstand me though, because like I said, I love Nintendo IP and pick up every Pokemon game just like the next guy, but it seems to me that Nintendo's business model is one that will disappear before their eyes which are at the moment blinded by the (on-paper) success of the Wii. And you know, I also don't expect this to ever happen, at least not for 10+ years (unless Nintendo either A) conforms to the gaming market or B) creates new IP), but I genuinely want some input as to how Nintendo can be successful in the coming years without changing their business around.   Sorry for my incoherent ramblings and thanks for the discussion.
Hey all.   So basically I got into trees for helping with my chronic spine injury. I went into from day with the purchase of a firefly vape.   Since then I have used a pipe, bong, a joints. However 99% of the time I vape.   I like the quickness and no need to make sure batteries are charged etc of joints. But the smoke is just too rough and hot.   I use the firefly vape which vapes at 400 degrees. Obviously smoke from combustion is going to be hotter.   Do your lungs just adjust? Does it get easier?
When my daughter was 6 months old, we left her with her great grandmother for an afternoon (we were young parents, GG was not that old at the time). I bleached my hair back then, and bought giant canisters of hair bleach, which were neon blue. For some reason, I stored them on the kitchen "island" between living room and kitchen. We gave GG instructions for feeding our daughter, which included making formula from a small white can of formula powder with a big bear on the front. We came home from our outing to find our daughter in her baby swing, crying, with a bottle propped in front of her, which she was obviously trying to move away from. I am puzzled by this, and GG says she tried to feed our daughter while holding her, but our daughter kept arching her back and pushing the bottle away. I grab the bottle, open it, and GG has mixed water and BLEACH POWDER and tried to feed it to our daughter. Needless to say, GG never babysat our baby again, and I moved that damn can of bleach.
This will get buried, but here goes:   Once upon a time when Livejournal was still a thing, I had made several really close friends through one of the communities there.  Four of us were really close over the span of several years, though we had never met in person.   My one friend--let's call her Chris--starts acting a bit off for awhile, a bit out of character. We were concerned, and my one friend begins to check up on her.  Couldn't get ahold of her, a bit flaky, etc.   Turns out that at some point over those maybe 4 years, Chris moved in with a new roommate.  Patty is a bit needy and unstable, but needed a place to stay.  Chris gets bored with LJ quits checking the site and Patty just... hacks her info and pretends to be her.  For  years.   They live in a big city, and Chris's life is glamorous. (Hence finally getting too busy for LJ). So Patty begins to pretty much RP her real life, revealing way more detail than Chris ever did.  Embroiders in some places, but is more or less legit.  I guess it was fun, since it got her the attention she wanted.  Stole other bits of Chris's identity too, charging stuff to her credit card, etc.  Once it was discovered, Patty got the boot out, and it took Chris a long time to put those pieces back in order.   It was and still is messed up.  To this day, I'm still not sure how much of Chris's past is real, how much made up, or when her crazy roommate took over.  I'll never know.  Still friends with the real Chris, but that did it for LJ for me.  Huge violation of trust, right there.
I have seen this coming.  My wife has been on the verge of becoming parentless.  This weekend was a mess... almost ending with the sheriff getting a phone call.   It should be a fun relaxing family hobby of hunting.  My wife and I have it setup well for easy get away fun.  Built nice stands, wild life cameras, new RV for everyone to stay, electricity, water system, off road vehicles, lots of wild life, came fires, guns, tools and fresh air.   The issues have been building for years.  Selfishness, glory, child accessories, misogyny, lucky no real physical abuse, but narcissism in abundance(they call it being loud and pride themselves on it.)  I have enabled it through getting along modes to keep grandparents and cousins in my sons life.  It has recently been getting worse, driven by my BiL.   So BiL is divorced and has custody of 2 kids on every weekend(way more story here than needed for point).  Mil hurt her shoulder at Xmas but refused to get to looked at until new deductible year.  When BiL and FiL hunt they come and stay with us in a RV that I bought big enough for everyone to stay.  BiL's 2 kids, 3yo and 6yo have no ability to stay quite for long periods of time hunting and he expects to leave them at RV\camp for MiL to watch.  She can not normally control them but is still expected to watch them.  She really does not like coming to hunt and I think forced to come this weekend with a hurt shoulder.  My Wife and I feel sorry for her and will trade skipping hunting and help her at times.  So everyone went hunting one AM.  My wife and 4yo son hunt well, so Mil stays with the 2 other kids and slept in.  The older boy decided to climb up in the top bunk to get a toy he was not allowed to play with and then jump down 5 feet almost hurting and breaking things himself.  Mil tries to handle the situation and in the process gets beat by him(not the first incident including actually being suspended from kindergarten).  Kicked in the face, punched, called names, so with a hurt arm all she could do is sit on him until calm and then restrict him to sit in the naughty spot until "dad" gets back.  Well Dad, seeking glory shoots a game animal from too far a way, way beyond his skill, and wastes the meat.  He decided to toss it in the woods.  This is after he shot an undersized animal and took pot shots at others just to get "lucky" earlier this year.  I make this an issue and insist he retrieve the animal, tag it properly and keep in edible condition until he gets home.  This winner of a Dad then decides to punish his kid by taking him hunting since he can not leave him with Mil anymore.  Guess what the little brother then learned, you guessed it, if he acts bad, then he will get to spend time with his Dad and hunt.  Did not work, because he is actually a good kid in a bad situation.   So the evening hunt comes up and I shoot an animal, get word that BiL also shoots a nice animal.  We were glad.  I go back to camp to process animal and notice BiL and FiL are not back yet.  Ask wife to grab some lights and a friend and go help look for it. I will be along once I get things done in camp.  Wife gets a call they are coming back to camp to drop off kids.  I get done processing and walk over to the group talking and find they are not planning to go look for the animal.  I start asking the std questions, which way was it facing, where did it run, where did you aim, did it jump, did you hit it, where was it standing.   Each question got a different answer and made him mad that I was asking reasonable questions to make a judgment where the group should start looking for it.  Finally BiL boils over, drags in a bunch of past issues to pile on and distract.  I asked him to calm down, walk away and smoke a cigarette.  Then come back to the group so we can get to the bottom of what to do.  FiL jump in to start defending him dragging more shit into it and acting childish, calling names and making this about him.  I tell them to call down or GTFO.  "Or what?  How are you going to make me?" I said with a phone call.  I was not going to fight them.  They were not being rational.  There were guns and kids around and none of that escalation needed to be here.  They walked away.  Came back said we will take you to where he shot it.  We load up and roll.  They get lost in the dark, lead us to the wrong spot, I think on purpose and as the rest try and focus on the task, but they continue to distract.  Calling the group manager's mom.  Blowing up other phones.  Trying to see if I have the power to kick them out for good.  Lucky for the group manager he knows them well and sends the call to vmail.  He later txt me to call and find out the situation.  Give him my perspective and let him handle the pieces he needs to about the animals.  I still needed to resolve the family escalation issues.  I ask FiL to talk.  He walks away.  I point that out and he turns around but then decides to walk away and I point that out again and have it noted that he needs to come and talk to me.  He had also started in on my wife\his daughter on more crap.  The rest of the evening went quietly as I finished documenting my animal and give them some space in the RV.  BiL decided he was uninvited to sleep in RV and ask if his boys could still sleep.  He tried the wood floor of the camp house but I see he opted for is truck.  FiL decided that I did not uninvited him and he hid away in the back bunk.  During the night propane went out (I got cold) and I got up to switch tanks since I did not sleep much and nor did my wife so we opted to no go hunt in the AM.  BiL and FiL did, they had no more tags and had they shot something it would have been more issues.  They never did go look for the animal in day light.  I gave them space after morning hunt buy going and shooting in a new gun.  When I got back they were gone and reviewed events with others to make sure I conducted myself properly, then we went to look for the animal.  Lucky for BiL, I am sure he under estimated the distance and shot under the animal.  The tracks did not indicated any sign of wounding.  We resigned to leave it at that.  BiL and FiL setup a meeting with the group manager to see what their rights were and if I had any power.  He left it that no I nor he had power beyond influence of how the group contract is executed.  And they had to realize that their actions will be called out if an incident occurs as no one else is making bad choices and risking their right to hunt.   Extended Family Christmas is in 2 weeks at our house.  I have not decided how to handle the events yet.  I will no longer enable their behavior.  I have not decided if I will take further action to repair\distance the relationships.  I do know that for any repair to take place, material progress will need to made for specifically the 6yo boy in the form of x managed counseling, etc which will drive BiL to be better Dad\person and thus FiL in check.  Beyond that I will let time work on this with my wife and how she needs to process the events with the existing history of previous incidents.  It is a mess.  And I know the manipulation that is coming.  How to manage it.  And those caught in the middle, like my MiL, I do feel sorry for them, given them counsel previously on how they could manage it but in the end, they choose to continue to enable them.  Others like my son and wife who may be losing access to their heritage   Thanks for listening.  Sorry my stories tend to be broken.  IF you have an insights or specially recommendations on how to get my 6yo nephew managed help they have to stick to I would love to hear it.
What I have actually found is that it is all well and good to ban the OP champs, but it can actually be beneficial to ban champs that you may get countered by. Also, at my elo (~1100-1200) some people dont even know how to play the FOTM OP champs and so leaving them open in favour of banning counters can be better.   Fun story, had someone first pick amumu cause he is OP atm. He levelled Q first, didnt take machetes and rushed ninja tabi into warmogs. So this can very much happen. You may get a lot of flak from your team but if you can crush your lane for example, you can carry np.   But there are some broken champs that require bans atm - KhaZix, KhaZix and KhaZix.   Last thing, if you have first pick you can ban in such a way to guarantee yourself a champ. Just leave 2 champs open after your 3rd ban (for example Shen and Amumu) the enemy team then either bans one and you get a guaranteed pick, or they dont ban either (best thing to do) and you can get your preference.
So my 02 wrx is having that notorious fuel leak.   I took it to a local dealer last year when I was at school and they inspected it and adjusted something. Well unfortunately that was like three days before I had my accident so I do not know if that ever fixed the issue because I wasn't able to drive until it was too warm for the leak to occur.   ANYWAYS... Basically I missed out on the warranty thing because the shop would only replace it if the smell returned. Which sucks because it is a $600 repair...   Anyway I really do not have that much money lying around... Taxes are coming up and I will most likely owe a couple of hundred and I am not working at the moment which makes this even more difficult.   I am pretty sure that I can do this myself but I just wanted to see if I could get some advice from people who have done this in the past.   Required items   Updated  Fuel Rail  hard fuel lines   New hoses   Manifold Gasket   Assorted tools   Coolant   However  this is a 13 year old car. A lot of things are pretty old on this car and I was hoping that someone who has done this could possibly tell me what things are most likely to break while I am doing this.   I don't want to start this and end up with a bunch of things breaking. So is there anything that I should either worry about breaking or replace while I am in there.   Thanks for the help.
Was recently on a flight from ABQ to MDW.  Flying Southwest, I had a nice boarding zone, and got a front row seat next to a young, small-framed woman named Holly.  We got to talking about how this was both of ours' first time in the "front row" and how the lack of storage was made up for with the extra leg room.  Eventually we got on a conversation about the TSA (they held my bag on the previous leg of the flight and resulted in me not having my luggage) - she admitted then that she was a TSO at ABQ.  I told her I had many questions, to which she obliged to answer.  Here's some highlighted points I found out:     Most of the TSO's don't want a union, at least the ones in ABQ don't.  The only ones that do are the "lazy and unmotivated" ones that don't get raises or bonuses.   Your raise, as a TSO, is determined by a score.  That score is in part based on your annual review, partly based on your supervisors input and partly based on SOP tests you are given.  If you perform poorly in your job function, on your review and also fail those SOP tests, you receive no bonus or raise (also, "Washington" can say no raises regardless of your score).  The TSA people who want to unionize are the ones who are performing poorly (not taking the tests, etc).   TSO's are on a 2-year probationary period in which they can be fired on the spot for anything (minor to major violations).  After that 2 year probation, getting fired is difficult (short of doing something illegal or falling asleep in the baggage room).   You don't have to take off your shoes 100% of the time.  You can state that you have "medical reasons" and the shoes can stay on you (but you'll have to be swabbed manually for explosives).   You don't have to tell the TSO what your medical reason is for not wanting to go through a metal detector.  You can simply state you have a medical issue and won't go.  You don't have to say you have a fake hip, pacemaker, etc.  Just that you have a medical reason not to.   When someone makes a scene, they are trained to think it's a diversion.  Which is why the swarm and shut down screening from time to time.  This is why some of them are so unkind to opt outs or those that are questioning.   As with anything, if you're going to cause a delay, make certain you have PLENTY of time before your flight - like 4 hours or more.   There are certain flights that are deemed "a risk", those flights are predetermined to be risky from a DHS office in Washington, and sent to the the local airports daily.  Those are the flights where they perform and additional carry-on luggage check prior to boarding.   Each gate at an airport is given a passenger volume number every day.  That number is based on ticket sales, as well as historical travel data for that date/airport.  They staff based on this volume number - which from what she says, is often off base.  Many times there are too many of them, and often times there are too few.   TSO agents have to stay at the airport when there is a flight coming in late or early.  This is in case a passenger leaves the secure area and needs to re-enter.  The TSO's love late flights, because it is double pay for them and they have no screening to do (no outbound flights).   The airlines do have some power to dictate who should/shouldn't fly.  The TSA can and does pass on their belief about a person, but the airline can trump this if there is no law broken.  Most of the times, the airline sides with the TSA.   Some airports and airlines are upset with the TSA because their laws/mandates cause the airport to spend more $ reconfiguring the queues.  There are many airport officials who have beefs with TSA reps about their regulations only to be told they must comply for "National Security reasons".     An interesting conversation.  Seemingly nice girl, a bit power-hungry and thought too much of her "badge" (to which I challenged if she had arresting power and she backed off a bit).  Kept insisting she made too much money for what she did ("E" band as a TSO - not a supervisor), and that the supervisor application was simply too long of a form to fill out (as to why she didn't want to move up in the ranks).   Either way, I learned a few things, and got a more deeper understanding of other things.  Hopefully you did also.
at 4th of july party this past summer i got hammered. now there are three type of drunk BassettHound Type 1 is the loud obnoxiousness Type 2 sleepy passes out after 1 or 2 drinks and type 3 the flirt who tries to fuck every everyone women from here to Pasadena well on this particular night i was type 3 was out and about and i was drunk texting every girl in my phone trying to hook up and trying to get well eventually i came up upon this girl megan and at the time i forgot that she wasn't very attractive but i knew she was easy. so i started texting her and eventually got her to send me a pic of her tits and i was bragging out them to my buds. well one of my more sober friends was nick those arent very good tits and then i yelled out "SHIT MAN TITS ARE TITS!" well i kept texting her and we a agreed to do some pretty sexual things. well i passed out then when i awoke and i had no recollection of the previous night well i started going through my phone and i found the conversation and while all my friends were passed out of the floor and i started screaming "no...NO NOOOOOOO" i sent her 4 pictures of my dick plus me with one of those douche hats on in the mirror flexing my "muscles" and then i finally got to the tits and they had to be the worst tits i have ever seen one sagged farther than the other and both nipples were HUGE i felt so dirty and that's why i deiced that someone is to take my phone from me when ever i drink again.
I'm literally desperate for her back, but I've ruined everything.   So we got together very young and she's always had a bit of a problem that i could do things she couldn't, i turned 18 366 days before she did so she's hated me going out (because she couldn't do it with me) i went to uni she missed me loads and expected me to still be available 24/7.   we've had our ups and downs, i've kissed another girl that we have both worked at getting over, i always said if it still hurt just to tell me, i'd walk away.   Then this December came and it was just impossible. i'm working full time on a placement but would go over once or twice a week (i have a football season ticket but i'd make as much time as i could for her) and would ring on my breaks but she'd also be busy with assignments.   I stayed at hers after a staff night out and started crying to her that i didn't think we were working and needed to discuss things but we never did.   then on the phone on December 23rd we agreed to call it, then she woke up and "didn't remember" anything. i was infuriated. i had hoped that a short break where we'd still see each other would fix us up and now she was saying she didn't remember me pouring my heart out? i felt like crap and took it out on her over the next month.   She tried in vein to win me back over three weeks, i'd turned heavily to drink. i'd drink on my own until i was sick drinking whatever i had with me. i was horrible to her while doing it.   Then a few weeks ago it really hit me, i need her. but now because of my actions she doesn't want me. i'm broken. i can't focus on anything, i'm not an emotional guy (as she kept pointing out) and in fact i've only cried over 2 things to my memory (other then as a tot obviously), her and my dad died 10 years ago.   I'm completely broken but can't talk to my friends about this, i just don't have that relationship with them and frankly don't want them, or anyone to see me like this (hence the throwaway).   I'm sorry if i've missed anything out i'll try and respond to everything 100% honestly, i'm looking for anything anyone can suggest, tbh it's just good to get this out there.   Thanks

This is a long story: I got the x230 in February last year, I am very happy with the laptop, quite good speed, no noise, no heat, and good overall performance(I Run Debian on it), After three months I started to experience some random shutdowns, I was travelling and was not able to take it  to Lenovo service, so I learned how to live with the shutdowns, I discover that the shutdowns were triggered by moving the laptop, a very slight move just closing the lid or some vibration on my desk trigger the shutdown a couple of minutes later. I tried several options, Updating the BIOS, removing the battery and using only AC, etc, the problem was not related to the OS,  because I can trigger the shutdown even while I was on the BIOS screen.   Anyway, By that time I was on the move, travelling constantly, I was very surprised that after I move geographically, the shutdown problem just vanished, I lived a normal life moving the laptop around, even trying harder to trigger the problem again, but nothing.   The problem arise again after 4 months, But this time, I was living steady in one country and I did have time to open the ticket with lenovo, the Customer support by phone is awful, they asked me to run the diagnostics, I did and then sent the results by email, they took almost 1 week to direct me to the local support partner, I took my laptop and they keep it for 1 week more, they said the reported problem was not there, so the day I went to pick up the laptop, I turned it on and I started to explain the problem to the Customer support guy, and suddenly boom! it shutdowns down! :) I was happy that the problem have just happened in their faces, and I was able to reproduce it like 4 times in a row.   They decide to keep the ticket open, and they said that the best option will be to replace the full systemboard, at the end they did it, it took they more than 3 weeks to do so!. But right now I'm using the laptop and everything looks ok again, I hope the problem  don't happen anymore, but I'm still very puzzled about this issue, I searched here and on a lot of forums and never find anyone having the same issue as me.
I'm actually kind of getting worried because within the past 2 weeks I've had 4 scary dreams with fighting, death, etc.   Last night I dreamt that my mother was over top of me hitting me in the face but I couldn't fight back. I've had another dream where my mother smashed my face up against the china cabinet's glass in the dining room.   Then there are the dreams where I am violent to others. I purposely crashed a car with my father on board. In another dream I punched my friend repeatedly because she said something I thought was offensive.   Now I'm not a violent person in real life. I am a quite the pacifist. I do suffer from anxiety and depression so that's definitely a problem. Plus I wouldn't say my mother is helping me at all. She is scary and terrifying most of the time.   (If anyone cares to read about my issues:  is informative but very, very
Hey reddit, I'm a girl living in a big expensive city. i'm 23. I live with my boyfriend been together for 3 yrs. Lived with him for 2yrs. I've been feeling upset. I feel like he doesn't care about me sometimes and i'm starting to feel attracted to one of my co-workers because he pays attention to me.     My problem : He's always busy, even when he's just doing his hobbies he doesn't take the time to care to hug me. He doesn't seem to like hugging me other than spooning. It's like pulling teeth to get him to hug me, and even then, he won't wrap his arms around me... forget about getting home and giving me a kiss. He's also very asexual at times, It's weird for me how much more into sex I am than he is. If trying to get a hug is like pulling teeth, forget about trying to get laid. He only wants to have sex when he's literally to his last-- of needing to just get his urge out. Sex is like a job or list of things to do to him, and he puts it off as much as he can. He really makes me feel self-conscious.     I'm 5.4, 23, Hispanic, petite. I've never been fat in my life. I've been told by plenty that i'm attractive even though I doubt it. When I go out, guys always want to buy me drinks and talk to me. I may not be the prettiest girl in the world, but I know that I'm not ugly. I dress well, always put together, always wearing makeup, earrings, dolled up. I don't understand. I don't have hygienic problems. I shower daily and shave and wax. I do everything to keep myself looking as clean and pretty as I can.     Here is the core issue:  I'm writing this because it has been going on for so long. We fight over the smallest thing and he holds grudges and will give me the silent treatment for several days. usually lasting 4 days to a week.     Here is what happened:  I spent 6-8 hrs doing hw this last wednesday. I went to class for 3 hours after. Got home around 10:30-11pm. I have to open the store I work the next day and work from 9am-2pm and have class at 3:30pm. Basically I needed to finish my hw for that class, so I knew I had to stay up. After this extremely long day, I got home and found my boyfriend with a twisted ankle. I took my eating time aside, took care of him. Gave him ice and pain killers, asked what happened, ect. I ate, started my hw (which I finished later on at 5:30am) 30 mins into working on my hw, my bf decides that he's too hurt to inflate the mattress that we sleep on. Even though he sees how busy I am--probably doesn't understand how exhausted I am. I told him no I can't I need to finish this so I can go to sleep. He keeps insisting and insisting i do it. I ended up saying no I can't, we got in an argument.     At the end I got upset told him he was selfish and when I was finally gona inflate the damn thing, he then refused to let me do so, went up to me shoved/pushed me really hard, took the inflator motor thing from my hand and inflated it himself. Afterwards, he went on yelling about how I was extremely selfish because just that sunday, we drank too much and I was throwing up and he had to clean up after me. Anyway, It took me up until that wednesday to recover because I was frequently urinating after being extremely dehydrated for 3 days. This was wednesday night/Thursday early morning. Now it's Saturday and he's still not talking to me.     Me trying to solve the issue:  I went up to him several times throughout the last several days, with plenty of time in between to let him chill out and think, and kept asking/begging him nicely without being pushy if he would talk to me about what happened because I'm trying to resolve this issue. He just pulls away from me and pushes me away ect. Says I don't want to talk to you." "Stop, I don't want to talk to you."     This is not the first time he's done it, I'm writing about it because i'm tired of this. He's already not really been so affectionate and he makes matters worse by neglecting me and neglecting to talk about fixing the problem even after I've apologized. I feel so upset. Like I just don't know what else to do. I live with him and he's been good, buys things I need, helps pay rent, ect. I know he cares in his own special way but it upsets me how serious he takes things.     If this had been him where I got mad because he didn't do something for me when I had asked him to, we would have argued, I would've gotten over it within an hour or two, and we'd be fine later.     He gets these long lasting grudges he holds, which I remember his mom telling me that she does the same shit to her husband.     So reddit what do u think?     I have to say he is tall, handsome, and very intelligent, a redditor himself. But i feel like he is a statue, I've had several talks and arguments before about how I hate how he acts over arguments and how he is extremely neglectful to me. Like I said above, it's so hard to get a meaningful hug or a kiss, and i think sex to him is just an urge, or a to do list thing that is never at the top of his priorities. It seems to me like the top of his priorities and what motivates him to go on with school and his stock trading hobbies, is money. I feel like shit, he's almost everything I want, except for the fact that he is not so affectionate with me and it makes me feel depressed. I know he cares but doesn't show it very well.     I grew up with an abusive family who also was very neglectful and would hardly ever be affectionate. I can't believe he is also not so affectionate. He grew up with a very outgoing single mom, who remarried, and he never really had his true father around, the man she is married to now is extremely irresponsible and ignorant.     Right now, there is a cute guy at work, small asian, older than me but I feel extremely attracted to him. He is the opposite of my boyfriend, My boyfriend is tall, hispanic, and big-not fat just strong.     Idk. I feel confused. The other guy is so nice to me and he seems to want to be more affectionate towards me, told me the other night that I was very pretty and that I was his favorite person at work, he couldn't wait to see me. He sounds so sweet, i feel bad. Idk how i feel. I'm in deep with my bf because I live with him. He helps me pay rent and he even got me a kitten for my birthday that we are raising together.     Anyone else feel like me?     Please help me understand what is going on, I don't know what to do. I love my boyfriend but it seems like he always wants to win and be right all the time sometimes I feel like he doesn't see my point of view. Explaining it to him doesn't seem to help and when I get in arguments like this is hard to get him to talk to me to really understand what happened.     My coworker (cute asian guy) is in a 5 year relationship and says he's talking a break, he talked about it like his girlfriend and him were ready to almost call it quits and clearly stated he didn't care if she went off and fucked another guy. I feel confused. I don't know what to do. I feel like i'm in an unfair position. I've been truly loyal to my bf, but i feel like when he does this with the addition of not taking the time to hug or pay attention to me--It makes me feel like i'd rather be with someone to hugs and kisses me and takes me out for fun sometimes.     My bf is the best thing that probly ever happened to me, he's great but he's not affectionate. I thought most guys were super horny all the time and always would want to put out, I have a lot of guy friends who agree with this, but my bf doesn't seem to care to have sex with me. I honestly know he wouldn't be cheating on me.     This all began after the first year with were living together when he began working long hours at a bank. Before he had a part time job and it was great. We had so much fun and it was the beginning of us moving in together and he was very affectionate. We used to pick each other up from work ect. Now, he won't do that, he's always tired, and during his free time he just wants to play video games, take pictures with his camera, and trade stocks. I can't explain the devotion he gives his hobbies-but it's a hell of a lot greater than the amount of affection and attention he gives me.     I feel like i'm cheating in my mind, i'm falling hard for my coworker and I don't want to make a mistake leaving a great long term relationship. I've also had an argument with my bf, because he doesn't ever see us getting married because he takes it from a religious point of view and we're both agnostic--i told him it's more of a commitment thing, and yea were young I don't want to be married yet, but I would like to be in the future.     My friends and their boyfriends always talk about future stuff like marriage and kids and things, my boyfriend gets iffy and would rather pretend i din't mention anything. He was the same about moving in together at first, and then one day he just agreed. But it's not the same idea with marriage--he's really put off by that.     Sometimes I feel like i love him to death and we have so much fun together, other days I feel like i wish I was single- and could go out and meet someone new. I feel confused. I am also a person who loves being continually touched or looked at from someone their attracted to. but my boyfriend doesn't do that. I see couples all the time holding hands, hugging, kissing in public, going dancing together--basically can't keep their hands off eachother, and he's not like that. I feel like he puts me last. He sometimes hates holding my hand, he's not embarrassed but just doesn't like to, even though other days he'll do it.
I had a very similar experience with Verizon. The sales person talked shit about the phone my wife wanted for a while. I finally got this person to bring out the phone so I could purchase it, but before giving me the phone, she gives me a list of things that are wrong with the device. She asks me to read it, says do you still want it, then tells me they will not take it back when it breaks...and it will. I bought the phone my wife wanted and on the way home she wanted to play with the phone. Turned it on and it would not connect to the Verizon network. Turned it off and on, nothing, reset the phone, nothing. Got home called the Verizon store, they say told you... I called a local Verizon re-seller and told him the story and what was going on with the phone. He looked at my account and said that the phone was added to the account but nothing was enabled for the phone. He turned data and voice on and the phone worked.
I did it in January. Didn't do the intense cycle and my 1RM squat before hand was 275.   It was tough, but I got my squat up to 315 for a 1RM. I definitely feel I would have made better progress had I not done Crossfit as well.
Fun one for ya:   the word "hysteric" or "hysteria" actually stems from the latin phrase for "Of the Womb". It Essentially was used to describe the irrational way woman would act while on their period.
Vote, get involved. Only 32%of the population voted. I'm sick of people not voting then complaining about what they should do. If you aren't going to use your vote then nobody is going to bother to listen to you.   When you don't vote the crazies get to run the country.   You might think that voting is useless. That is accomplishes nothing. If you think that then you haven’t paying attention. When you hear “Oh so and so is just pandering to their base…” do you stop and think that maybe they do that because it’s their base that votes?   With every election cycle that you vote in you force the system more towards the “winning” side. If young people don’t go out and vote then only those that pander to the old will go into power and their policies will be skewed towards them, their wants, their desires, their fears. If more young people vote then with each cycle the runners will be more aware that they would need to pander to you to get your vote.   This is true regardless of what demographic or social theology you align yourself with. It might take a few election cycles, but the more people turn out the harder and harder it will be for the crazies to overcome.   By the way, when I say election cycles I don’t mean Presidential Elections. I mean local, get involved in your municipality. Odds are that right now there is someone in your local community running for city council, or mayor or state senate that has a similar view of the world as you. They will never make it to the senate or congress if their career dies due to lack of support at the local level.   Even those that buy, er, fund the elections, need to consider the odds of someone winning. If they know that they are looking at a well education, involved constituency then the likelihood of them being able to run a wackjob into office is very low. If they know that most people don’t vote except the crazies than that’s who they run for, who they appeal to.   If you don’t vote then you have no one to blame but yourself. Inaction is an action, not choosing is still a choice. Lots of people are mad that good. You got mad now get involved, get active, get out and vote at every election.   /rant
This is gonna sound retarded, but it was a UFO. I posted the story have before, so I won't go into detail. We were outside on my car, and we were getting a little frisky when all of a sudden there were 4 bright streaks in the sky and some flashes and whatnot. My girlfriend has aa crazy fear of anything Aliens and Supernatural... like more than a normal person. lol so she wanted to go inside the house and just sit. She may have cried a little.
Eh? Ada masalah apa sama thread Belanda kemaren? Gua belum sempet baca. Ada yang bisa kasih
I was managing a pizza place in Vegas and a young, attractive woman in a rather skimpy outfit came in and asked to speak to one of my 16 year-old employees. They talked for a bit and afterward I asked who it was. It was her mom, who happened to be a 31 year-old stripper at the Olympic Gardens. She explained that she was the only girl in generations in her family that had not had a child before the age of sixteen. Her grandmother was 46, her great-grandmother would be 60, but had died a few years ago.
CPU coolers are generally considered a good thing, even if you aren't overclocking at all.   Now, that's not to say you need to spend 75-100 dollars on a 120mm or dual 120mm closed-loop cooler or one of those giant 120mm fan-cooled 8 heat-pipe towers.  Not at all.  If you want to overclock, those very well may be good ideas.  But there are a lot of other reasons to just have a non-stock CPU cooler.     The more heat you pull from the CPU, the better.  Especially under load.  With that 760, you're going to be gaming, and your CPU will go under load doing that.  Stock temps are pretty easy to keep low.  The CPU is designed to help with that.  You probably won't see a huge difference between a stock cooler and an aftermarket cooler like that Hyper 212 EVO at idle.  Maybe a few C.  Put that system under load, and the cream starts to separate.      Larger fan, lower noise.  Especially under load @ high RPMs.  Just plain fact.  The 120mm fan of that Hyper 212 (or most other aftermarket coolers) is just going to be quieter than the tiny little fan they put on the stock cooler.  Additionally, it's not just decibels.  I find that tiny fans, even quiet ones, tend to put out higher pitched -- and more annoying noise -- than a larger fan that puts out a nice low droning hum.  Graphics cards are the hugest offenders.  Listen to the tiny little fan on a stock GPU cooler spin up to full speed.  They get loud.     Look better if you have a case window.  Sure, it's aesthetic, but nothing says, "I put time and effort into my components and made this myself," than seeing a non-stock cooler on the inside.  Or, perhaps more appropriately, stock coolers just looks lame.
Our depth is good to have.  The Babins/Paces of the world have their own form of value due to experience....watch Babins sack and Paces pressure earlier and you see how simply reacting and not thinking has an impact.  Babin SMOKED that kid!  Not to mention some guys like Rontez, Darrell Eskridge, Jaiquan Jarrett, Kellen Davis have been around for a while and aren't unfamiliar with the game at NFL level, and our young guys are showing they can make plays too.  While its true their playing backups, you need to perform.  And ours did here.  If they didn't then the response is "You couldn't against fringe guys why could you vs stars?" But instead the response is "Ok, can you vs stars?"  Very different questions; for example "Damn that was a beautiful snag by Posey...could he have those hands with Brent Grimes and get open like that vs Stephon Gilmore?  vs. "Damn Dexter McDougle got SMOKED and gave up a 31yd catch to Hardy (who?) - thankfully he likely won't be 1:1 vs guys like OBJ this year..."     Bryce Petty could be the future....this has nothing to do with his play...but his Moxy as a person...his little interview left me thinking he is in the mold of Romo, Brady, Stafford, just a big old preppy jock.  These kind of guys seem to work out in terms of not getting picked on, unless your Andy Dalton or Mark Sanchez.  Frankly our QBs get picked on a TON...sometimes they deserve it...other times they don't - either way after getting picked on so much it has to wear on anybody mentally.  Although Bryce does have one hell of an arm....and he put a few passes right where they needed...accuracy has been a tough thing for many QBs since Pennington...his feet were set and hips rotated nicely on a lot of plays.  A few years and I could see this kid rolling.     Todd Bowles literally showed no emotions.  I really wanted this guy more than any other candidate...but goddam I hope this due has some animation in him during the season...show me you will get in a guy's face for a mistake...show me you get excited for big plays...I wanna see you acting like your in a fight for your life....just don't be a tool about it like Rex and make bad jokes all the time.     Greg Buttle is a douche.  He couldn't let Bryce go...he kept ripping on him for wanting to be a professional golfer if he wasn't an NFL QB during his interview.  Greg made a mockery saying ("Ha, does he know how hard golf is!" and something else...).       Ummm, Greg....The question was completely hypothetical...you know how many players probably would love to be a professional golfers if not for football?     Graham ran some nice routes.  Assuming a QB that can throw more than 15yards is playing...a few deep plays early in the season will be a must for this team.  Our short game stuff is subtly deceptive and could cause some real damage, but less so if we are always playing vs 8 in the box.  We will need guys like Graham and DSmith to stretch the field enough where Defenses have in their mind "It could be coming".     Nick Mangold is a man amongst boys.  He is a Top 5 JET all time.  But more than that...he was locked in and watching the whole game from the sidelines like a leader should.  Likely honing in on OL/QB...think about him being the leader he is and coaching up the young kids with what he sees.     Decker is a standup player.  I know many still shit on him not because they think he sucks but because they think he is overrated.  Yah, he had Peyton but he still put up just shy of 1000 missin 4.5 games last year.  Just as importantly though you can just tell he is willing to put in the work.  One shot of him and on the sideline And Fitz has a clipboard showing him something.  Decker was engaged and willing to give Fitz the floor...good to see respect and chemistry in a subtle way.  Seriously...when's the last time we saw a QB coach a receiver.  I am sure Holmes did the most talking during his time,  and so did Decker but likely in a more constructive way...but when is the last time we had a QB able to do the schooling and to legitimate weapons none the less.  Even if Fitz isn't starter his knowledge and the tenure in the game is useful...he will be the best 2nd string we've had in a long time which for them the two important things for that position is leadership and ready on any given snap to take the field...he fits that perfect!     I like our Louisville crew we have.  A 4th Rd in Powell and 3rd TD in Mauldin.  I remember Kerry Rhodes who was a 4th rd and he gave us a few nice years.  These late rounders from Louisville seem to give us something usually
This is certainly going to be buried, but when I was around age 11 I had a "friend" who lived in the neighborhood across the street who, in retrospect, may have been the victim of some kind of abuse.   He and his big family all acted just a little weird. They were all very poor and my parents have always been generous so we would feed them all the time, give them clothes, give them rides (none of them owned a car), loan them money/tools. His oldest brother was around age 17 but hung out with us younger kids pretty frequently. His younger brother was mentally handicapped and would follow his brother everywhere basically. They also all kind of smelled funny, like not BO or anything gross... it was just a weird aroma that I have never smelled before or since.   One day my friend shows up with a video camera with a tape inside it. He tells me I should check it out. He tells me that he made a porno... tells me how awesome it is. Now remember, we are 11 years old. 6th grade.   I press my eye to the lens and see his 17/yo brother getting head from a girl. I see my friend's hand basically pointing and directing them on what to do. There was no audio, and I didn't really want to look much after that. We put the camera down and he showed me how to make a Neopets account.   I told my mom about this like 1 year ago (I'm 25) and she was mortified. They moved away a few years afterwards and I have not seen or heard of them once since probably 8th grade.
Now I have an idea that helps his lane clear, but won't effect much else of his game. What if his chains were changed to specifically help with lane clear? What if they go through five minions and will hook on the 6th?  That way you can still shoot more than one through the minion line, still hook to another god if you so choose (it would still stop on a god no matter what) and fire with 3 chains of damage might be enough to clear.  This won't make him an op jungler or anything because there's only 3 minions to a camp so he could not shoot 3. Just keep all the scaling the same, but with 3 chains going through minions, that will add enough to his lane clear to put him in the meta.
I am also talking about America and the West.   If my boyfriend and I conceived tomorrow and he chose to "financially abort", I couldn't possibly scrounge up the money to pay for food, diapers, clothes, vaccinations and childcare (plus rent, as I live with him but would presumably be on my own in a scenario where he refused to support the kid). I also couldn't afford prenatal or obstetric care, which aren't covered by my health insurance. So, the choice would be abortion vs. (unsafe pregnancy+possible homelessness+poverty). I'd probably choose abortion, but can you really say that isn't a forced choice?   This won't happen to me, but it could happen to someone like me, a college-educated, middle class, white American who happens to be unemployed. (And if she lives in a  less permissive state

Teaching by rote is a lot cheaper and easier than teaching critical or creative thinking. Many developing countries have more of a mass production paradigm to running their schools.   This makes a lot of sense when the majority of your population struggles with literacy. Especially when your country's economy is based around primary (resource) or secondary (manufacturing) industries. Sure having a more innovative workforce is nice and all but why reinvent the wheel?   Aside from a few choice sectors where a country may benefit from being part of the cutting edge, developing economies can mostly get by with the majority of their workforce simply understanding and applying already discovered principles and processes. Chinese companies for example need only improve slightly on an already existing product and they will beat out the competition on cost alone.   I simplify the issue quite a bit, but in post industrial societies, we no longer have low costs of living and low living wages to help us compete on cost of manpower alone. Learning by rote doesn't produce innovators and entrepreneurs needed to keep our economies relevant in the global scale. Since we can't compete on labour prices and emulating products alone, we need to claim every first mover advantage we can get.   We gripe about the education system in North America all the time but our teachers are relatively well trained and skilled compared to even a generation ago. Its very difficult to teach someone to learn to think for themselves as opposed to memorising information.   Our biggest risk is that we don't do this well enough. Sometimes our education system falls back on lazy rote teaching or our students fail to be properly motivated to care about the "why?" behind something. This erodes this the advantages a post industrial economy needs to stay relevant in the changing world.
Reposting this here as well:   I don't have panic attacks, but I've done a bit of research that I thought was completely unrelated that turned out to be very relevant while learning about free diving/static apnea.   The human body has very few positive feedback control loops. The most commonly recognized one is hormone release during the birthing process, causing contractions, and dilation of the cervix, which in turn stimulates the release of more of that hormone. This makes sense, because the system is essentially going for an all or nothing game of pooping out a baby.   However, there's a much less common, and entirely unintentional positive feedback loop that affects some people. As you may or may not know, we do not control our breathing based on O2 levels. Actually, unless you have one of a few extremely rare and very serious lung diseases, you can't actually directly tell how much O2 you have in your blood at any given time. Instead, we monitor CO2. As CO2 levels rise, our urge to breathe increases, as they fall, our urge to breathe subsides. This is extremely important to know when you're planning on not breathing for an extended period of time, because it tells you that when your body is saying, "I need to breathe" it's not actually saying, "I need oxygen". Instead, it's just whining about being a little uncomfortable.   So, when you have a condition called Hypercapnia or too much CO2 in your blood, your urge to breathe is very strong. You feel this when you're doing exercise, your body is producing a lot of CO2, so you're body says, "Oi, you need to give us more air, guvna!" and you breathe faster, then the CO2 levels equalize and everything comes back into line. Simple negative feedback system. It works very well.   Now, what happens if you go the other way and end up with Hypocapnia, or too LITTLE CO2 in your blood? Well, ideally, your body just says, "You can knock it off now, mate, we're doing fine!" and slows down your breathing. For most people, that works pretty much all the time and for everyone, it works most of the time. However, if your body responds a bit too slowly and CO2 levels drop a bit lower, you end up beginning to actually feel the symptoms of hypocapnia.   What's symptom number one? Anxiety. Yes, breathing too fast causes anxiety as your CO2 levels drop below what they should be. Your body didn't respond fast enough to the call for less breathing, and now it's scared. "Hey, you bugger, we might just die, here, better trip the fight or flight!" You're scared, so your body thinks you're under attack, so it triggers the fight or flight parts of your sympathetic nervous system. Now, part of this response is to, you guessed it, elevate your breathing level. This causes an open loop of breathing too fast causing your CO2 to drop too low, which causes you to be afraid, which causes you to breathe faster. This goes out of control until you pass out or somehow catch up.   That's why breathing into a bag works. It elevates your CO2 levels by not allowing new air for gas exchange.   But, it also hints at other possible fixes without a bag. Basically, you want to bring your CO2 back in line with what you need, which can be done by slowing your loss or increasing your production. So, when you FIRST start feeling a panic attack building, you theoretically should be able to thwart it by holding your breathe, or if you'd rather, moving large muscle groups, even just doing rapid contraction/release cycles. A bit of both, and you should be in the clear in a few seconds.   As I said, I don't have panic attacks, so I can't directly test any of this, but it's theoretically sound. Anyway, I hope this helps someone. I also have a method of slowing your heart rate very quickly and dramatically, but it doesn't seem to work for everyone, and this is long enough. If someone's interested, I'll write it up.
I was 18 and was finishing up my 2nd semester in Engineering.   I was interviewing for an international internship (my first interview) and was nervous as hell.   The interview was in a large ball room with about 60 interview tables setup.   Every table was occupied.  As the interview concluded, I stood up to shake the pretty ladies hand and suddenly my left leg gave out.   I had been sitting motionless for about 30 minutes and had managed to pinch a nerve or something.   My entire left leg was asleep and as I leaned in I fell, smacked the metal chair I was sitting on and crumpled to the ground in like a melting piece of denial.   The folding metal chair folded up on itself and with the clanging and banging.   As I managed to haul myself back up,  EVERY   SINGLE   PERSON  in the building had stopped their interviews to look at my pathetic ass.   The surprised lady leaned over and asked if I was allright....   all I could say was, "yeah, mind if i lean on this table for a couple of minutes until my leg isn't asleep".    I limped out past all of the other interviewees after several minutes.
I only started reading the series about 2-3 years before book 7 came out.   I was slightly disappointed by the ending because there was all this build up to it,  and it just sort of ended.  It felt like there was an amazing ending in there,  but King didn't want to write it anymore.   Even more so because I was an avid King reader for quite a while and read most of the books that tie into the Dark Tower.   MINOR INSOMNIA SPOILERS   The glimpse that Ralph had of the Crimson King/ catfish was one of the most terrifying parts of that book.   END INSOMNIA SPOILERS   I also thought that plugging himself into the book was also kind of shoddily done, at the time.   However, as it has sat with me for the past several years, it kinda makes sense.   If King had been killed in that accident,  there never would have been a resolution.  So, he became a part of the story that he was trying to write.   Its like with Robert Jordan and The Wheel Of Time.  The last 3 books that Sanderson wrote were originally supposed to be 1 book, and it probably would have been over 1500 pages and not made much sense.   And the ending, where he says that this time through the loop, Roland has the Horn and things will be different,  I kind of like it. It was King admitting that he knew he couldn't finish the story the way it was meant to be.   He couldn't live up to the expectations built up around his own book.   Also, I had a friend who was reading the series since it first came out, so for over 30 years, and she was absolutely furious about the way he ended it.
We met to play on Roll20 but our DM never showed. I started looking at the  one page adventures  but nothing was easy enough to port over in a pinch.   I found a  random map  as I went. I am only used to playing a PC. The hardest part was scaling the image to match the grid. Some tutorials on YouTube helped.   There was enough in my mind to get to room 6 or 7 but we ended up clearing the map and having tons of fun. The story grew as I went and managed to turn into something interesting. With a little work it could be worth doing again.   I don't have a monster manual or a DM guide so I pulled some monsters off the web. The PCs used new toons at lvl1 so at the end I made them lvl 2 instead of calculating xp.   If you are nervous or concerned about being a DM I highly recommend trying. Let it be known that its your first time I guess but have fun! PM me if you want to test something out too.
Oh Riven.... ohhhhh Riven. You win nearly every lane matchup if your summoner can auto-cancel correctly and lose most matchups if they can't.  You have infinite mobility, way too much aoe, cc... that ridiculous shield, and are only gated by armor stacking, but then cleaver exists... and more movespeed... and now the cdr mastery...  oh lordy lord.   And before 45% of the comments complain about her low winrate, I'm not proposing a straight-up change to riven.  I'm proposing a small buff that increases her best parts and nerfs the unintended side effects.   Basically it goes like this: Throw in a few buffs to riven's Q and R and passive scalings.  Change the way her auto cancels work to be a bit easier to use (I have no clue how they work...).  And the big kahuna... giver her energy costs.  However, throw in an energy restoration on discharge of passive stacks; doubled against champions.   What this does is essentially nerfs her ability to endlessly escape ganks, never lose a chase, etc. but doesn't affect her sticking power or dueling power.  When she is able to get autos off on champions she has no energy issues; the restoration should be larger than the cost of her Q if she hits a champion and slightly less if she hits a minion.  This means that as long as she sticks to her target she effectively has no costs.  Only when she is spamming to chase/run/return to lane is she hindered.   Riven always will be a good duelist, and a decent aoe champ in fights.  What she shouldn't have is a perma quinn ult with 45% cdr.
Dead. Fucking. Wrong. Gamestop is supposed to put a sticker on the used cartridge as well. Also, most gamestops have a display case with the used DS and gameboy games out of their cases. This isn't just a simple mistake, someone missed a huge step in taking in and labeling a used game.
I once overheard a girl talking about how she was going to fail a math test that was taking place later in the day. I turned around and said to her "You can't fail the test, you're Asian!" Spent the whole day apologizing to her, but after all this time, I still feel like shit.
Look, I hate cheaters as much as the next guy.  I really do, BUT, if the state of the game (endgame at least) is going to be a desolate wasteland now because of these supposed softbans.....I want the cheaters back!  I mean, I usually come home from work and I can pvp all night long, maybe a minute AT MOST between getting a successful invasion at soul memory 200,000,000+.     Now the last 2 days I've noticed a significant (as in I spam the orbs 20+ times in the hot pvp zones and get nothing)  drop-off.   From, whatever you have to do to make pvp active again, PLEASE do it.  This feels like DS1 now....as in no one is playing.
I feel like you've been excoriated enough so I'm going to give you some very good news.  Your average woman is only fertile (able to conceive) about six days out of each menstrual cycle.  If you really did have sex a day or two before her period, she was in the last stretch of her luteal phase, where her body is ending its preparation for implantation of a fertilized egg and is preparing to shed her uterine lining (i.e. having her period).  This means her estradiol and progesterone levels were at or near its basal level.  Now, sperm can actually survive as long as six days in the vagina, but during this time she would be either at the end of the luteal phase or the very beginning of the follicular phase.   What does this mean for you?  It means that if she has a normal menstrual cycle and no other gynecological irregularities,  it means it's extremely, extremely unlikely for her to get pregnant.   It would be so unlikely that she could become pregnant by having intercourse a day or two before her period that her OB/GYN would want to either test her further to find out what's wrong to make this possible or to write a case study about her 1 in a billion pregnancy.  Seriously, it would be that unusual.  Now, if you had unprotected sex at other times prior to that, this may change things, but the fact that she had her period on time also makes this very unlikely.   So, congratulations, you dodged a bullet.  Learn from this and always use a condom with spermicide gel.  Even if she takes the pill faithfully, it's still possible she can get pregnant.
Over my winter break, I had the opportunity to volunteer at a special needs orphanage in China. It was honestly one of the best experiences of my life, so far.   Time to give a little background info:   At the orphanage, the group I was involved with had two shifts with the kids. One was in the morning, where we spent time in a large room, akin to a cafeteria, to do arts and crafts, play music, and just have fun. After several hours of strenuous labor (those kids loved to run around, especially be on shoulders and be ninjas/army men), we were able to rest for a couple hours. Then we went into their homes for the afternoon. Their homes are similar to foster homes. There are around 10 children in a home, maybe more, and are ranged from infants to 14 years old and, I believe, they are placed in the home based on their disability.   I am currently engaged to a nine year old. He treated me as if I was his princess. There was this nine year old boy, with downs syndrome, who loved to act like a ninja, or something of that sort, and "attack" all the guys, even some girls, on my team with hand gestures. One of the days we had in the cafeteria style room, he started to attack me, which was fun. I would fall to the ground and pretend to be dead, then try to get up and he slashed at again. On that day I was wearing a shirt with realistic Mario, Peach, and Yoshi. I think that is where he came up with the notion that I was a princess. He stopped attacking me at that moment, grabbed my hand, and started to dance with me. Over the course of the next couple mornings, he would kneel down, grab my hand, and kissed it. After kissing it, he would say something, which went over my head since I only speak English, not Mandarin.   When he started treating me like a princess, around four other boys did the same thing. They would lead me around, take me to a chair, which they would pull out for me (how gentlemanly), and all that stuff. Apparently, one of the times this young boy knelt down to kiss my hand, he said "I love you" and put a little ring on my finger (it was a fuzzy pipe cleaner that was in the shape of a star). He kept this going for the rest of my time I was there. He was/is an awesome little guy. I hope I made his week like he did mine.   My next story tugs my heart every time: (he got jealous of my "fiancé")   My little monkey, he was my ultimate little buddy while I was at the orphanage. It's hard to not grow attached to the children, but it cannot be helped.   I am unsure as to what the medical terminology for his condition is, there are two things, but I do know that it has to do with his heart.   On our first meeting, he proceeded to shoot me down with a Lego gun and showed how "strong" he was. So strong that he could "push me down", keep in mind that he is 6/7, and I am 18. Whenever my shirt would ride up, I would always have to pull it down, so after a couple times doing that, he started to pull it down for me. He was also the "hat police" as he called it, and took away my beanie, whenever I would be wearing it, but would always end up giving it back. He was a little sweetheart. Over the week he would always find me in the morning and grab my hands and either say: "shoulders", to be placed on my shoulders, or "monkey"! Monkey is when he would grab both of my hands, put his feet on my upper legs, walk up to my waist, and do a flip (thus why I call him my monkey). Even though there was a language barrier, except he spoke English exceptionally well, we were able to bond.   Go back to before I left for China:  I was at a grocery store by my house and found a small sock monkey keychain and felt the need to buy it and use it as a travel buddy, where I would take pictures of it in different locations of the world, which I did.   Now back to the trip: It was time to leave. The two amazing, eye-opening, marvelous weeks were over and I realized that I may never see any of these children again. Especially my little monkey. My monkey. I proceeded to find my purse, where the sock monkey was hooked on to, and wrote on the TY tag the name of my monkey. When I went on my final journey to the houses in the afternoon, I took the sock monkey with me. It was time to say goodbye. Our afternoon was completed and it was time for them to have their dinner. Our last day was done, would not see them again because we were leaving the next morning. I found my little friend, showed him pictures of the sock monkey on my phone, which he loved to look at, and then brought out the sock monkey from my pocket. I showed him the tag, which had his name on it, and asked him what it said. He said his name, and I said "yeah, it's yours. It's your buddy now".   I will never forget the smile on his face.   He was the sweetest little man. I really miss him. I hope that someday I can go back. I would love to return and help teach the children to learn English, or help them with Therapy.   I mainly hope they all find a loving and caring home because, well, they deserve it.
So I have been texting and generally talking quite a bit with this girl the last couple of weeks, and we sms a lot. One day, i dont get a response for like 5 hours, which can happen and is fine. Follows is a rough translation, with me being norwegian:   Her: Shit, i thought i had answered this one. Sorry bout the late reply. How are you. What have you been up to today?   Me: So you hadnt forgot about me? ;)   Her: That's easier said than done ;)   Am I completely out of my mind interpreting this as something overtly romantic? I talked to a friend of hers, and she thought she didnt mean it as something romantic. Losing my mind here, about how i should approach this.
The above quote is the Firefly perk that some weapons can have. However that information is much more detailed and makes me enjoy spec'ing my stuff much more.   The in game description is this bland butt-text: "Precision kills with this weapon cause the target to explode". Which is a crap description and other perks are even less descriptive.
Hi,   I got a ginger beer kit as a gift which has got me into the world of home brewing.  Following the process through, I started the yeast culture last week and its now in a 1 gallon carboy with airlock.  It appears to be fermenting ok; at 21^o with a .. pardon my lack of terminology .. a fizzy break at the top of the carboy and the airlock releasing about 3 bubbles a second after one day.   Having read lots of recipe variants they say to ferment in plastic containers to avoid exploding bottles.  I am looking to bottle this in reused Leffe 750ml bottles and/or Grolsch pop tops ..   Here is where my confusion lies; if I wait until the fermentation stops in the carboy does this not mean that I should be safe enough to bottle the resulting ginger beer without fear of it continuing to ferment and carbonate with enough pressure to explode a glass bottle?   .. or have I completely misunderstood this whole fermentation thing? :-s   Recipe:   Stage 1: Starter     1 Pint of cooled boiled water   1 sachet of ginger beer yeast   1 tsp of sugar    1 tsp of ground ginger    then 1 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of ground ginger daily for 7 days      Stage 2: Fermentation     1.5 lbs Brewing Sugar    .5 lbs Light Spraymalt    2 pints of cooled boiled water   juice of 2 lemons   topped up to within an inch of the neck of a 1 gal carboy
I can see the good deed, but the first half of the story was almost entirely about this nasty brick weed you were picking up. You decide to be nice and give it away to some homeless dude because you think it's some nasty regs. Had you got some nice dank bud, would you have even thought of doing the same thing for that homeless dude, or was it only because you had some ganja you deemed "unworthy" to smoke? I'm not trying to sound like a jerk, but to me it sounded more like charity by  misfortune  rather than charity by  good will   edit:
Maybe someday we'll invent a computer powerful enough to try and backtrack the orbital mechanics of every single asteroid between Mars and Jupiter and see if that big green belt coalesces into a terrestrial planet that was ripped apart..
I have thought about doing this before but figured the odds of getting a response are so low, why bother, then I realized all I have to lose is the time it takes to type out this, so sure, lets try.   My occupation is to keep the polar bears in norway in check. I am sure you have heard the rumors of oslo having polar bears in the street, but if you live in Oslo you have seen there actually are not many polar bears around at all, you can thank me for that. I often think about how I would spend my fortune if I was trying to become a super villain. I think one of my better ideas would be to drive around in a van with a tattoo artist and kidnap random people on the street, knock them out, tattoo their face with all sorts of weird shit, then throw them back onto the street and let them go on with their lives. Maybe make a hidden reality TV show of it.   Ok so a bit more seriously. I love meeting new people, experiencing new things, and seeing new places. Travelling (often alone) is probably my favorite pastime since it incorperates all of these things quite handedly. Ignoring the obvious ways to spend your free time (procrastination, hanging out with friends, game of thrones, reddit etc) I like to try to push myself to learn new things and improve myself in some fashion. Be that physical or mental maintenance (stuff like eating healthy, working out meditation or reading) or learning new things (currently my main things to learn would be Python and Piano.) I do spend slightly too much time procrastianting doing these things though, but so does everyone I guess.   I am generally a very happy and positive person, if that sounds like you thats great, and if not thats cool too. Not looking to jump into something very serious or all consuming, I would just like to meet some new people and see where it leads to. Qualities I appriciate in a person is someone who is open-minded, adventurous (somewhat of a cliche but whatever) and does not take themselves or anything too serious. But honestly I tend to get along with all sorts of people so I am sure there is a chance we would get a long swimmingly whoever you are. Oh should probably mention I myself am norwegian, but where you are from, how old you are or what you do matters fairly little to me. Mainly looking to people who live in, or at least near oslo and would be interested in meeting, but if you live somewhere else in the world and feel like messaging me, by all means. Include a picture in your message and so will I. Also this turned out to be somewhat longer than I planned it to be so heres
7 years ago I was 19 and pregnant. I wasn't in the best situation and I realized I would have to make some tough choices to keep myself and my baby healthy and safe.   I lived in a small town so the only thing I could think of to do was cut off contact. With everyone. I had a best friend at the time who was there for me during my pregnancy but because she was friends with several of the people I was trying to avoid and keep out of my child's life, i just stopped communicating with her. I know she asked about me alot (my sister worked in a store there) but I had changed my number and moved with my parents to the outskirts of town.   I know I probably came off as a total bitch to my friend but I was doing what I thought was right for my baby. Ever since then....I have thought about how I should have handled it differently. I felt bad but I was more concerned with my baby not being around certain people for what I thought was good reason.   She recently sent me a friend request on fb and I honestly got a lil excited. I thought it was a chance to maybe reconnect with an old friend. But I didn't accept it.   If I do reconnect with her,some of my past may be dredged up. My son's biological father could creep into the picture. It's a small town. I live about an hour from there now. Bio dad has never seen my son. I have been married since my son was 1 and his DAD is my husband. They are close and happy.   So I guess it may seem silly to ask for input from strangers here but I need outer perspective. When I told my husband he said there was no need to apologize its been years and that I am being a smart person, choosing whom to allow in my life.   By the way...my family,my husband's family and my stepkids all know that my husband is not my son's biological father. I feel it's really only a matter of time before he finds out....he is 7. We don't see my husbands family all that much but his step siblings may slip up one day. Its never really worried me before that he would just "find out"because he was so young but he is older now and very smart very perceptive.   I guess my question is....would it be a good thing to reconnect with my friend and allow her into my life (she was so happy when I was pg) and just come what may if bio dad hears that I am actually alive and well with his child? I mean am I actually opening that door myself by having a good friend back in my life?   Or do I keep laying low as the sahm that I am and just stay away from anyone I know or knew that knows bio dad?   I made my mind up years ago that if he approached me in the right way and genuinely wanted a relationship with his child I would not get in the way. But is my son ready? Hell...am I?   I know getting back into this friendship is not a guarantee that bio dad will just jump into my sons life. But I feel in my heart there could be a good chance.   Any advice is welcome. Please be honest :)   And i know you may wonder WHY I didn't allow bio dad in my son's life. It was honestly not the way I planned things. At first my parents advised me to just leave the guy and move on and so would he and all that. Well when I first knew I was pg I tried to give him another chance (we broke up before i knew) and it didn't work out. His mom and sister and brother harassed me on different occasions and he did move like 5 hours away at one point.   I became fearful in that I worried he or his family would just take my son and run. I had nightmares. I cried all the time because he was always calling and berating me or trying to control me...which he did a very good job of when I actually lived with him. Those may not seem like reason enough to keep him and his family from me and my son but AT THE TIME that was the judgment I made and my parents were very supportive and my sisters would not tell anyone where we lived (they were in school; jr high & hs) unless they were trustworthy. I mean I felt I made the best choice I could then. But through the years I have doubted my choice many times.   Ok thats it. Please help me out!
This is going to be a lengthy one. Sorry in advance.   So, I had this crush on a girl, which I've had for quite some time. But, we rarely spoke to each other. We'll call her H. H and I share only one class together, and to my luck, I get a seat close to her. Eventually, her and I start talking more and more. Over Facebook, we started talking a lot. We probably exchanged over 500 messages there. And topics ranged from school to personal lives. We exchanged a bunch of secrets and got to know each other pretty well.   Anyways, we are talking about her parents one day, and how they are somewhat over-protective. She makes comments on how they wouldn't let her do this and that. She then tells me that they established a dating age for her at 16, which she is.   So, the next day, we start talking again, like usual. Things lead to the next, and we decide to have lunch together. Over lunch, I teach her things that I know on the piano. It went well, and we decided to have lunch 3 more times.   Things continue to escalate. And I'll point out, that it wasn't always me that started the conversations. It was maybe 1/3 her, 2/3 me. Anyways, this happens over a month. So, we talk again one day, about finals and how we're gonna study. When  she  says that we should study together. This was a huge green light for me, and we study the next day.   We meet up after school, and "study". We really didn't study at all. We just talked back and forth. I made one joke that made her cry of laughter... It went really well.   So, a week passes, and we make another date to study. Same thing happens, and we don't study again. Midway through the session, I inform her that I have a big secret, to tell her, but I am unsure if I should. She wants me to, and near the end I tell her.   Basically, I talked about this really pretty girl that I liked, and how we have been hanging out a lot recently, she's giving me all the signs, etc. It was super obvious that I was talking about her. I then concluded with should I tell her or not? I also asked H if she had been in the same situation as well. She replied, yes tell her, and yeah I am in the same situation right now.   So, I ask her out, and she says yes. She gives me her phone number, and all goes well.   School ends, and during the month of June, we exchange somewhere around 800 texts. Each week we try and schedule our date, but we are both very busy. And we were unable to get to it, until last night.   So last night, she didn't get off work till 5, so we had to see a late movie at 7. I really tried to push for dinner or ice cream before, so we wouldn't just sit in front of a screen for two hours. But, claimed that she didn't want to, because she wanted to save her money for college. I told her I'd pay, but whatever. So no dinner, just a movie.   We meet up, start hitting it off again, I'm making her laugh, etc. We go to the concessions, where I buy popcorn. She said that she really didn't want anything. Whatever.   So, we go into the movie. Edge of Tomorrow. About a quarter of the way through the movie, I decide to make my move. I go for the arm around the shoulder. But she shot me down hard. My arm literally was on her head for about 20 seconds before she turned to me and shook her head.   That nearly killed me. I was astonished. I immediately stopped eating the popcorn, stopped thinking about the movie and everything. I was shocked.   So we sit there, watching the movie for the next hour or whatever. I can't even laugh at the jokes or anything going on in it...   The movie ends, and we go back to the lobby. There we sit down and talk for about 10 minutes before our parents come to get us. Small chit chat until the last 4 minutes.   I say "You didn't like the whole arm thing?"   And she tells me that she thought that the date was to get to know each other better...   What the hell...   I say that I am so confused, that she gave me all the signs. We talked for so long, went on 2 study dates, 3 lunch dates, exchanged over 1500 messages, etc. I then specifically mention the whole secret thing, where I confessed my affection to her, and she said YES.   She said that she was shocked that I had asked, and didn't know that I was coming at her with romantic intentions the whole time. She then said that she didn't know what to say, and said yes to spare me pain..   I am pretty pissed at this point. Pissed off, confused, shocked, shaking...   I go into great detail about how it's better to be upfront about it. Saying that telling me all of this now is the worst situation to be in.   Anyways, our parents arrive. I tell her that we can still be friends, and she agrees, and we go our separate ways.   What the hell guys and gals.. Did I misinterpret signs? She lead me on sooo dang hard...   I think I feel terrible because of the anticipation as well. Waiting a month for the date, and thinking that it would go so well. I really thought I was going to date this girl for a long time. I had things planned out after the first date, I knew what I was gonna get her for her birthday, etc.   I'm stunned, shocked, astonished. I feel terrible, and am still trying to comprehend all of this.   Was I right? Was she right? I dunno. It's over now...

I think the reason game of thrones (speaking about the show mostly, as a reflection of the books) worked so well, although it used this plot device again and again, is that no one is safe. Ned died, Robb died, Oberyn died.   While some characters are such fan favourites (Tyrion, Arya, Davos) that one can guess they are implicitly gonna be okay, I think part of the  sitting on the edge of your seat  appeal is that something messed up CAN happen to them. I'd say Tyrion and Arya have way more plot armor than Davos though. Bronn too could be an easy kill.   Now using unexpected death again and again for shock cheapens it severely. Even just with the books alone, no one reading dance was totally convinced Jon was dead, and I don't remember having as visceral a reaction as any prior deaths. In terms of television, shows like the walking dead and Lost serve as less-worthy examples of when death is overused. Revivals cheapen them even further by making death seem not-so-permanent. Again the best example I can think of is Lost.   Anyways, the above ramblings are trying to hint at an issue I have with Jon's revival - an unprecedented amount of plot armor. In the context of R+L=J he is way too fitting for a "chosen one" trope. I only really see one of a few outcomes for him:     Becoming "evil", whatever that means in this setting"   Surviving towards and playing a key role in some kind of final climax for the series.     Jon had his shocking death scene. He had his OP revival. There isn't much left to do with him.
I didn't anticipate myself ever posting in this subreddit, I'm usually the one talking to people to help  them  out, but now I need some advice myself.   I first saw this girl in my Psychoacoustics class, and didn't really talk to her for the whole term, because she was so beautiful (and great personality), I figured she HAD to be taken. But I eventually figured out her best friend is a guy who I'm almost 100% sure is gay, and she definitely is single and not really "talking" to anybody that could be suspicious to a possible relationship (outside of myself).   But she's in another one of my classes this term, and so I just got up and started talking to her. We hit it off really well and have just started playing in a band together, and have great chemistry. We tend to stand by each other and talk to each other more than most people we're in contact with, and sit alone and talk about things like music and etc.   But I'm really unsure if I should make a move. I get great vibes from her, but I don't want to mess up this great music we have going by scaring her off with my advances.
I think I can guess the story.   Takes place in America About two and a half years after the initial outbreak. The main character is a grizzly, jaded man with a beard who lost most/all of his family in the beginning. He lives in a small commune where he is the leader of a rag-tag bunch of fellow survivors. The group consists of a hard-as-nails women with a soft side, a bald, black man who was in the military and knows a lot about guns, about a dozen other nameless people and Sean Bean trying his darnest to fake an American accent again.   Life is monotonous but stable as the group as the group struggles to survive right before winter starts.   Suddenly, a stranger appears! Being followed by a rather large group of infected.   The group initially decided against letting him in but he swears he knows the localation of a secret safe area away from the infected. The group is hesitant but Sean Bean, thinking this could be a chance to find his missing wife opens the gate to let in the stranger... And the infected too.   Battle ensues and everyone dies except for the main character, the black guy, the women and the douche that promised safety.   Black guy and Grizzly guy hold Douche at gun point with the intent to kill him but Women convinces them to go along with him because they have nothing better to do.   Journey occurs. Along the way they run into bandits, a desperate survivor family and a crazy scientist that keeps infected in his basement in hopes of curing them. Some infected probably attack at some point, maybe.   Along the way, Douche admits he doesn't know where he's going and he made up his story because he was desperate. Despite the budding friendship, Grizzly Guy flips out and beats the shit out of Douche while Women and Black Guy try holding him back.   Then a bunch of military guys show up, kill Black Guy and kidnap everyone else. Douche and Grizzly Guy get stuck together in a prison cell where Douche admits that he escaped from these guys and they plan on using them as slave labor and that Women is going to be raped.   Douche and Grizzly escape somehow, fighting ensues again. Infected show up again. Final showdown between Grizzly and Military leader happens but they both die as Grizzly sacrifices himself to let Douche and Women escape.   Douche and Women find a helicopter and take off (Women knows how to pilot a helicopter for some reason) and Douche reveals he found a map while they were escaping of an abandoned island with supplies.   Final scene depicts the helicopter flying off into the rising sun.   Mid credits scene shows Sean Bean coming out of the wreckage but then slips on a piece of jagged rebar covered in infected blood.
I'm going to try and explain my issues and just get it out of me now so hopefully I can get my life back on track.   I've had a long history of depression and anxiety that I've been combating to realize that I do have control over my own life and happiness. These last few years though I've been complely unable to enter or pursue any kind of romantic or sexual relationship because I can't stop thinking about my past.   My last relationship my ex (together for four years) we're in the middle of a particularly bad time together. The long story short is that during a fight (not a heated yelling match but a long disagreement) in order to end it/get her way she flat out said in a calm very serious voice if I didn't go along with what she wanted she would call the police/friends/family and tell them I was physically abusive to her. I am 6'2" and about 220 pounds. I don't live in a big city nor is it a particularly progressive part of North America, I don't have any faith that I would be believed. I've never been in a fight or physcial with anyone in my life, the thought of being violent turns my stomach.   From that point on I was crushed. I spent the next while planning my exit by recording as many conversations and fights as I could until I felt safe enough to leave with enough evidence in case she did.   The previous relationship before that I was with a girl for a few years,  I had tried to break it off after spending a large part of it feeling miserable and codependant. That's when she threatened to kill herself if I left her. When I did get out of that months later I eventually learned from friends that she ended up telling people we broke it off because I was hitting her.   At this point in my life it's affecting me almost every day. All I've ever wanted in my life since I was a teenager was to have a family of my own with a loving wife and have children that I would tell them how much I love them everyday.  I am at the point now I find myself getting frustrated and mad when I see friends or other couples in relationships where they are happy because mine have been anything but. I feel like I've had my agency taken away from me.   I've tried dating since then but honesty when it comes to anything I'm  paralyzed because in my mind I worry anything I do might set her off, make her mad enough to cause her to think or claim something happened. I dont want to make the first move unless she'll think I am pressuring or raping her. Eventually I just let the girls who show intetest in me break off from inactivity.   Sorry if this is disjointed or not very concise/clear. I'm posting from mobile.
I just got off of the phone with my roommate (Fred) who, instead of currently being at work as usual, was sitting in the hospital receiving 8 stitches in his arm. He told me that this morning he was walking his dog down our normally quiet street with his headphones in when he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his arm. He turned to find himself at knifepoint by a comically large man on a bicycle who then demanded Fred's wallet before riding off. When asked by the police to describe his assailant, Fred cautiously gave his description, as he wasn't exactly proud to have been bested by this mobile conundrum. Instead of the bewildered amusement that Fred expected of the police officer, he was met with overt frustration and a long sigh. "Yeah, that's Rick Ross on a Bike. He's slippery." Apparently RRoaB has been mugging people on his bike for a long time, yet somehow the police just can't nab that pesky g, and therefore earned the best alias ever.
Its Probably Denver or Kansas City. These two city's are prone to 40-80 degree days in nov-feb but also almost as prone to -10 degree days like chicago and minny. Minny is consistently cold in the winter while Denver, KC and probably some other cities similar are not always cold but due to this the fans have to adapt to hot and rigidly cold days throughout the season, even in the winter. States in the middle go through the most changes due to being prone to norther cold fronts and souther heat waves. Now if the question is who has to deal with the most brutal weather in general its probs, Buffalo, Outdoors Minny, Greenbay, Chicago.
The biggest being that I stopped singing and talking to myself   I often have music stuck in my head. On medication, the music in my head changes from novel compositions to songs I have heard before. Also, on medication there is only music stuck in my head when I'm not trying to focus on anything. It's not intrusive at all.   I get better at singing known music on medication. Off medication, when I sing, my mind jumps ahead or backwards to other parts of the song or even to a different song altogether, and this interferes with my ability to sing the song properly. I also have difficulty accessing lyrics. Off medication I get tunes playing even when I'm trying to focus on something else.   However, I'm usually very good at improvising songs and lyrics. I've never tried improvisation on medication - maybe I should one day.   This isn't music specific. Pretty much everything follows that general pattern. Medication => more structured thought, less random dreaming.   I have difficulty storytelling on medication. I usually make crazy stories to entertain children, and with medication the stories don't automatically spring to mind of their own accord. However, I get more actual writing done - off meds i have difficulty sitting down and putting things on the page. Off meds I tend to write in short bursts - a reddit post, the beginning of the story...and then I start thinking about something else.   On medication I am able to do more math homework, but if I have a really abstract or high level problem with an solution that requires a bit of out-of-the-box thinking, I often won't figure out the answer until after my meds wear off.   I have different social interactions on medication as well. On medication I think of fewer things to say. Also, I'm less empathetic and have difficulty dealing with if someone changes the topic from what I was interested in. I'm also more easily annoyed if someone is doing something annoying. However, I am on the whole more confidant and extroverted on medication.   Off medication I'm extremely patient and I get completely immersed in the other person. People say I'm a good listener. I'm extroverted in that I enjoy being around people, but in the sense of "sociable" it's complicated - I alternate between being really talkative and completely zoning out.   These differences are slight (because I take very small doses) but I've magnified them here to show the contrast.
Theatre has a 30 second cap, and currently glitches and causes my PS3 to black screen and freeze, seems to be a problem CoD is "dealing with", so god knows what will happen   EDIT: When I render*
Trying to find some weapons, so I can use a hybrid "battlemage" build instead of a pure physical melee.   So far I have found this to be true for me:   -Daggers:good for ripostes and backstabs. Other than that, I don't dig their powerstance, and haven't tried them as a side weapon. I think Black flamestone+Stone ring is cheese (because of the stone ring).   -Straight swords:nothing interesting here besides blue flame. Some have stabs, some have slashes. Some scale better, some don't.   -Greatswords:heavier than straight swords and slower, but have better damage. I dig the MLGS and Majestic greatsword, as for others, meh. I like the plain old Claymore though.   -UGS's:hard to use, both in PvP and PvE. Slow, don't deal enough dmg considering their speed IMO. Look cool and have gold swings though. Personal favorite:zweihander (light+the moveset).   -Curved greatswords:they all feel the same. Decent. I am not impressed, but they are cooler than regular greatswords IMO.   -Curved swords:fast. More "ninja" style with fancier moveset. Cooler version of straight swords IMO.   -Katana's:I hate the stigma, but I also stigmatize them. They are cool "traditionally", but again, nothing special about them. They are like cooler straightswords that do too much damage (not all of them). Durability suck in PvE.   -Thrusting swords:I like them because they are fast and have the poke. I also hate them because they have the poke, making them pretty 1 dimensional.   -Axes:Why use axes when you have straight swords? Legitimate question, atleast IMO.   -Greataxes:One of the "great" weapon classes. Honestly, I feel if you are going to use a big and heavy weapon, use one that has strike damage.   -Hammers and Greathammers:best weapons IMO for PvE (atleast for STR builds). Nothing special about this, I think Club is epitome of this STR "class. Hit smash destroy.   -Spears:playstyle-wise, longer version of thrusting swords   -halberds:much like axes, I am confused. You have spears, and you have axes. And then you combine them into a weapon class that does neither as effective as its respective counterparts. But I guess spin2win is alluring.   -Reapers:damage of a straightsword, if it hits the sweetspot. Bypasses shields. Wohoo!   -Lances:are to spears what greatswords are to straight swords. Cool if they hit though.   -Twinblades:I don't know. By far the coolest weaponry to use. A bit underwhelming in PvP, it's fine to mow enemies in PvE.   -Whips:cool in PvP, practically unusuable in PvE due to durability.   -Claws and Fists:Vanq. seal or normal claws really. Vanq. seal is godlike everywhere   -Bows and greatbows:Bows-nothing to talk about. Greatbows-useful for stunning in PvE, can be decent in PvE.   -Crossbows:Don't use them much, though Sanctum crosssbow special is BRUTAL.
For those who have been off of Reddit for a few days [Glee shamelessly rips off Jonathan Coulton's Baby Got Back](   Coulton posted [on his blog]( the controversy of Glee basically lifting his cover version's style of Baby Got Back wholesale. Due to a loophole/grey area in US copyright law with regard to licensed cover versions, the cover versions themselves are not protected without explicit permission from the original author.   The main reason this has been an issue is not that Glee used his version of the song in their show but that they did not give any creative credit to Coulton.   It is also controversial because this appears to be a pattern of abuse by Glee of using small artists cover versions of songs without permission or credit. Since the small artists have no legal recourse due to the letter of the law in this particular case, it is something of poetic justice that Coulton is now posting his own "Glee" cover version of their cover version of his cover version of the original Baby got Back.
I think it goes beyond this. He would be on Admiral level over all, I believe.   He may have been beaten, but an army comprised of 2 former Shichibukai, several strong DF users, a ton of notorious New World pirates, High-ranking Revolutionary Army leaders, and a current Yonkou to take him down, and even then he beasted most of them (including BB's entire crew) with relative ease. He was simply out-numbered; he couldn't be everywhere and do everything at once.   Yes, he did get his ass handed to him later, by the sounds of it... but he had just taken a Gigant Wax Stamp to the face, among other things. Plus, Blackbeard's power would be as surprising to Magellan as Magellan's was to Blackbeard at first, only Magellan wouldn't have Shiryu there to bail him out.
Hey there, i'd like to solicit some advice on my situation. I have a BA (major in politics and minor in economics) from a good school but what i really want to do is work in a field that address the engineering solutions to economic problems (hopefully manufacturing, ethical sourcing and technology solutions to labor issues, so somewhere between mechanical engineering and systems design). That's all well and good but theres a big educational gap between my current knowledge and what i would need before even starting a program because i come from such a artsty fartsy background. So my questions are as follows  -does anyone have experience bridging the gap between a BA to a STEM field career? What did your educational path look like? -go back for a BS or fill in the gaps with non-program classes and head toward a masters program? -are there any programs/schools/scholarships (long shot) anyone knows of aimed toward either woman looking for careers in STEM feilds, people coming from a liberal arts back ground who want to work in technology or that are associated with the technology/economy/manufacturing intersection?
It may not actually be fat. Some of it, yes, but it sounds like you have actual breast tissue and this is called gynecomastia.   It wont go away even by reducing fat. I would say go to a doctor, but since you're young all he's going to tell you is to wait for a few years. Some guys develop this problem around puberty and it goes away after a while. It may not hurt to go to the doctor anyway just to get checked out.   Hopefully it will go away for you in your early 20s.   I feel you on the biggest insecurity thing. I had this problem through school and it ruined my posture, ruined my confidence, and caused lots of clothing neuroses that I'm still dealing with. I still have the man boobs and run into the same issue as you. Losing a lot of weight but man boobs are not going away. I went to the doctor and was told it was actual breast tissue. I had several hormonal tests done and scans and it was rather unpleasant. Unfortunately I am almost 24 so its permanent and my only option is surgery.
I'm late to the party, but I'd like to contribute my symphony of impatience, absent mindedness and "disrespect for the man".   In college, my girlfriend and I went to movies once a week for more than a year. Did not matter that there wasn't always something worth watching, that wasn't really always the point. ;)  The theater had just gotten a free standing self-serve ticket kiosk you could use to pay for tickets. Almost nobody trusted it, so there was never a line like the 5-10 minute line at the box office.  You enter your movie, the show time, swipe the credit card and it prints off your tickets and receipt.  There was a delay between printing the tickets and the credit card receipt (and a cancel button). Only took once in a hurry to realize that after it printed the ticket, I could hit cancel and it would skip printing the credit card receipt and drop to the main screen for the next person.  Yay, saved 30 seconds of my time!   I'm the kind of guy who reads credit card statements looking for transactions that don't belong, not for ones that should be there. Heck, 15+ years ago, it sometimes took a week for a charge to clear, and if that spanned your closing date, it would be another month before you had to pay for it.  So it took about 6 months for me to realize it was actually canceling the credit card transaction after printing the tickets. I could say that 6 months of doing that was an honest mistake.  Another 6 months was less honest.   About two years later, after I had moved to a new state, about a hundred transactions showed up on my credit card from that theater.  I had completely forgotten about my shenanigans, so I called up the card company and said I had no idea how the transactions got there, but they could see from my activity that I hadn't gone to that state that month, let alone seen 5-6 movies a day for the month.  They removed all the charges and said they would let me know if they had any follow up questions.  A week later, I put it all together... The card company never called back with questions.
A little bit of back story - Dated a girl for 18 months, was very depressed by the end of it, I hated the relationship and was going through the motions for about the last 6 months. When we offically broke up i felt amazing.   A lot of people have said how I had changed when I was with her and just wasn't myself. Now 1-2 months on I am really struggling without her. Shes moving on fine and I've been with a few other girls but I just cant seem to shake her. Im constantly thinking about her.   I've had two other serious relationships and I've acted in the same manner where I knew it wasn't a good relationship but after a few weeks my thoughts only remember the good times and glaze over the bad.   I feel like this plane going around in a death cycle and I'm struggling to keep the plane going up. My past relationships have fucked me up for a long time in the past.
My girlfriend. The first time I saw her my jaw literally dropped to the fucking floor, I had never seen a human being so close to perfection. For two years I lusted after her, even traveling the entire eastern half of the United States  and finding absolutely no one of compare. Then she dyed her hair blond, and WHOA. Her already 10/10 looks jumped to infinity at that point. Having finally gotten together, every time I wake up I think "Damn, how did I manage to score a girl like that?" and get intensely happy. And god her legs, they make you go holy shit! I could go on for hours about her extremely sexy, but also extremely adorable at the same time face, and that body jesus fucking christ I'm in heaven
WE'RE SIGNING REUS EVERYONE!   Seriously though, can you stop upvoting this attention-seeking moron?   Wow he called Flamini and got it right! And Gervniho. WOW. He know his shit. Wait a minute. He also called at least 10 other completly unrealistic shits (Fabregas "soon", Rooney deal agreed and many more) and deleted them so people more easily forget that he is just guessing like anyone else out there... He basically reads newspaper rumours / sometimes probably other rumours, rewrite them, delete them, act like he is ITK and everyone acts like he really is, when he randomly guess one right.
This is an /r/funny post, so I feel like I shouldn't have to type this up... but in true form, we seem to have gone off the rails with some misguided male version of feminazism, so I feel compelled to try and explain this.   The thing is, guys don't exactly face sexual discrimination and objectification everywhere they go. Taking female athletes (one of the few strong female role models our society has) and objectifying them sexually  would  be a lot worse than what this girl is doing. Male athletes are one of the  more  sexual types of men in media and they're at the top of that power dynamic anyways. Where a male leaping onto the field is oppressive, a woman leaping onto the field to grope men is just a reversal of dynamics.   It's funny in subverting your expectations and it's harmless because all those players and everyone else knows that they're still going to go home, be rich and be able to bang any fan they want. It takes nothing from them. For a female athlete, it's saying that even here, even in the  one  place you should be able to get away from the constant discrimination and objectification, even here you're going to be seen as merely something sexual.   The other (and honestly, more obvious reason) more force would make sense is because (edit: on average) guys are bigger, faster and stronger and a  lot  harder to stop than tiny white girls. They also have a lot more potential to hurt or kill someone before you can get to them.   I don't see how you guys can simultaneously be laughing at the guard's inability to catch her and angry she wasn't terminated with maximum prejudice. Is the tiny blonde girl a threat or not? Also, why complain about police brutality if you're going to get all pissy the moment an authority figure chooses to exercise discretion with regards to the use of force for once?   Sorry, these comments are stupid as hell, most people ITT should be embarrassed and I'm sorry if you'd rather keep handling this like two-year-olds because these thoughts were building up and I needed to comment somewhere. It's interesting how the internet has given birth to the male version of a feminazi. It's just a shame they're all on reddit.
1) My post was really centered on the asininity of the cliche.   2) The idea that you could stop the U.S. gov't with your guns is absurd.  In any event, from what I've seen of the willingness of people to sacrifice their privacy to facebook or the rights to their gov't (via the patriot act etc) the gov't isn't the problem; we are.  We're just too stupid and intellectually lazy (not to mention just plain afraid) to keep our freedom.
You wont save much, the reason Automatics generally 'waste' gas than a Manual is because the engine speed and the Transmission speed are spinning at different speeds because of the torque converter. The engine will produce power and send it to the TC and go to the transmission, during the power transfer you can lose anywhere from 20~30% Power. With a manual transmission the transmission is connected to the crank shaft of the engine which makes the Engine and transmission match the speed of each other making the manual more 'Efficient.'

Other people appear to have answered the "is it free" aspect, so I will address Obamacare.   The term "Obamacare" refers to the Affordable Care Act of 2010. It is not really "one" thing though -- rather, it includes hundreds of provisions and programs that are intended to improve different aspects of the healthcare system in the U.S.   There is one key provision, though, which is tied to the idea of universal health care, and it's what was tested in the Supreme Court. That is the insurance mandate: the law stipulates that starting in 2014, everyone must have insurance or they will be charged with a tax penalty of about $600. (There are subsidies and exceptions to help poorer people afford insurance and/or avoid being penalized for not being able to afford it)   The basis for this provision is similar to the reasoning of universal health care: it's better if everyone is covered in the same system. That's for two reasons: 1) healthy people contributing into the pool helps even out costs for everybody and 2) we reduce the problem that emergency care for uninsured people creates -- it has to be treated, so in the pre-mandate world those costs get passed on to everyone in the form of higher hospital bills, but if people have insurance ideally they will not wait until it's an emergency to seek care, meaning lower-cost care, and if they do have an emergency anyways, the result won't be sneaking into everyone else's bills but reflected accurately in the cost of everybody's insurance.
So I made a mage Mores deck(its weird) and at the end of the turn I always find my self almost attacking with him because of the green highlight around him. It was frustrating and I was hoping that he would be a 0 attack, then I thought of something. If Mores is like the head servent and like tells where all the stewards go, shouldn't he be a 0 attack card because he doesn't do any of the physical work, the stewards do. Also making him have 2 health would be beneficial because swipe kills him and with the new malestorm coming out, so will it seeing it is a better arcane explosion. This is just my thoughts and I would really like to see your thoughts.
Did you have a valentines date that involved bud?  I did, and it was awesome.   I didn't have a real date, or even any plans.  But yesterday a lady friend invited me over to her place.  We toked up and watched The Union (which if you haven't seen you need to watch.)  Eventually it led to more but you're too young to hear about it.   It was rad, unexpected, and I'm glad I got to know a cute girl that I was interested in better. That is all trees, just wanted to share.
He's really respectful and humble when he's talking to someone who actually understands the game.  He can be pretty blunt to the typical forum\stream monster.  If someone is like 'cody v yang is 4-6' without explanation he'll call them out and ask them to give reasons for things they say.  Now if you give a good answer and are reasonable with all your claims he'll like and respect you.  If you say something stupid or wrong he'll be a bit of a dick in telling you why you're wrong.   He assumes he's better than you till you've shown him otherwise but TBH he's probably right, there are only a handful(rough guess 25ish people) of players equal to or better than him in the states.  Most of the online warriors who think they're hot shit butt heads with him a lot.   I personally think the community needs more people like him, in that a lot of wrong information(particularly match up related information) spreads like wildfire through the forums and there need to be good players who have actual merit to their statements saying otherwise.  He is pretty vocal about how 'tech' is not something he likes and players who work hard on their tech butt heads with him a lot.   He quit SF4(seriously playing it anyway) because KoF is a much more 'pure' fighting game, where if your mechanics aren't up to speed you'll never win.  Who's to say that makes KoF better but that's a big part of why he likes it.  and he's pretty vocal about that and if someone likes SF a lot they'll probably dislike him for it.
So, I am a sixteen year old high school sophomore. I've been under a lot of stress lately to pass my classes. I'm cursed with a deep-rooted motivation to do nothing and am getting by in school with 3 D's, 2 C's and a B+. I really enjoy learning, but have little motivation to do the work necessary; however, I have exemplary standardized testing scores.   Now, with me working in  a lot  of work in preparation for finals, my sister dodging all responsibility for the next few months until she can move out and my brothers' young age, the dishes are not being done as needed. Of course, my parents will not do them, because they really shouldn't have to. But now, my dad has gone on to more juvenile methods of punishment. Basically, he's giving the family the silent treatment.   I'm taking a break from review to just share this. My mom and everyone else understands that there is definitely an extent of disaccord, but we can not reach an agreement. I have to work incredibly hard to pass my exams, the dishes need to be completed and the whole family needs to reach some kind of consensus. But it goes nowhere very quickly.
EDIT:  I just got a response from the professor. All it said was "Fine, see you tomorrow." No mention of the oral exam. This feels a lot like getting a text from a girlfriend that says "we need to talk" and when you ask what's going on she says "it's fine, never mind." This does not feel "fine" at all.   I am taking an Asian language course at my university, and this language is difficult for any native English speaker. I also have a learning disability.  This course is the only intro to the language offered at my college, so it is overloaded with students. The typical maximum amount of students for an into to an asian language class has 18 students, sometimes 2 can be brought into the class on top of that 18. This class has over 25 students. There is no time for discussion in class. My learning disability makes me forget things easily if I don't practice a lot, so I try to go into office hours for extra help.  During the last office hours session I had with the professor, he told me that I would not need to take the oral exam because I have been practicing with him. I agreed to this, and told him I might come in during my scheduled oral exam time in order to ask questions on the final. I commute from home about an hour away from school. Due to an unrelated family issue I ended up staying at home.  I also talked with him about how I should handle my extra time accommodation for the final, because my learning disability gives me time and a half but I would have to take the exam with people who don't speak the language and wouldn't be able to help me if I was confused about a question. For my other language classes the professors have given me extra time in their offices if I needed it, which I usually don't. But it's nice to have.  Today he emailed me saying that I might fail the final because I didn't show up for my oral exam. He also said that he will not give me extra time.  You might ask me why I haven't contacted him through email about all of these issues. This professor does not answer his emails, EVER. I have emailed him about me being sick, asking if he's available for office hours, and asking about when a meeting is scheduled, and quickly learned that email gets me no responses and I have to talk to him in person.   What do I do? I do not want to fail this course and I am afraid of how this is going to go. As of now, he hasn't responded to my email that reminded him of what agreed to for the oral exam. He probably won't respond at all. How can I talk with him tomorrow so that we can work something out? Right now I am thinking about offering to take the oral exam later on, and if he disagrees I will go to his supervisor or something.
Making this a self-post instead of trying to get karma linking to my own blog.)   On the Nerdist podcast recently Gabe was talking about how Steam Big Picture is trying to break down the artificial separation between the living room and the PC, but when asked about mobile gaming Gabe seemed to think that was currently impossible to do because the current stakeholders in the mobile industry (Apple in particular) don't want to make that possible. I thought of an idea that I think could bring the Steam experience to mobile devices, and I sent it to Gabe in an email. You can read the full idea on my blog:
Not a bartender but was a server on a slow day and standing at the bar talking to patrons. A bar regular and myself were swapping work nightmares when he claims to have the story to top all stories. This particular regular worked for a company that empties sceptic tanks. On one particularly busy and hot day (in texas) of tank emptying, he stopped to take an early lunch to get a break from the heat. He stopped at a local mc Donald's and ate not realizing that after his last stop he didn't open the pressure valve. (Apparently with the substances in the truck and the heat this is something that should happen regularly) so after his long lunch in 110+ degree weather he heads to his next stop, with the pressure valve still not open. He get out of his truck at the home and goes to the door to do his typical let them know he's there and get paper work signed routine. After talking to the customer for about 10-15 mins he goes to the back of the house with his truck to begin pumping out the sceptic tank. He goes to the back of his truck to grab the hose and realizes the pressure valve wasn't released. So with the hose in re left hand and the valve in the right he releases the valve; only to have the pressure that has been building up in the tank ROCKET shit and debris out of the nozzle and into his face with so much force that the shit went up his nose and in his mouth and of course down his throat.  He said he was in the hospital for days, not just because of the substance he ingested but the pressure coming out of the hose actually bruised his face so bad that his eyes were swollen shut.
I wrote this guide a few years ago and never really shared it. I've mentioned it on reddit occasionally and people asked me to have it posted, so here it is! I trimmed it down some to save you the trouble of reading. I wasn't sure of what subreddit to post it in, so forgive me if this seems out of place. Read through it and if anything, just tell me if you found it interesting! Enjoy!     6 Steps to Getting a Girl to Text You First  This 6 simple step process is designed so that you can begin regularly texting that girl you’ve always wanted to talk to, but lacked the courage to approach normally.   Step 1: Get the Number  Most guys should be past this point already, so skip to step 2 if you have the number. If not, then you're going to want to continue reading. This is the most difficult step, because it's hard to give advice on it. I would just suggest picking up knowledge of her interests from talking to her and, if possible, try to form some sort of acquaintanceship. Getting their phone number from a MUTUAL friend and asking them about a school assignment or other subject seems to work easiest. For instance, “Hi, this is [your name] from your chemistry class. [Friend’s name] said you were adept at chemistry. I was wondering if you could help me out with something?” State your name, say how you acquired her number (important to include), then ask a completely harmless objective question and don’t be afraid to be flattering (people like others who find them smart/funny/good looking/etc.). If possible, this may be your best option because you avoid having to actually ask them their number. Whatever you do, get this step done.   Step 2: Spark a Conversation  Use your imagination! Just like in step one, pull in those interests of hers and get her attention. Most likely, you'll want to start with, "Hey! Do you know what we had to do in [shared class]?" or "Are you going to [random event] tonight?" Once you send that, pray to your deity that she texts back. If she does, then you have succeeded. If not, repeat step two until she does respond. If she doesn't ever, give up. Sorry. MOST girls will at least give a guy a chance until you give her a reason not to text back. There’s always the possibility that she "doesn’t like to text" (if she says this, you know what it means), but people are generally polite and text back originally.   Step 3: Mold the Conversation  I can't say this enough: be interesting and be grammatically correct. Too many guys I know are terrible texters and they hardly know how to actually be interesting over text. It sounds lame, but everyone knows there is an unwritten etiquette to texting. Also, being funny is generally a good tool over text. If you’re not good at being funny, just be articulate and enthusiastic. Don’t be afraid of emoticons and punctuation abuse. Most importantly, just be yourself! Unless you are truly a boring person (which we all know that isn’t true, is it, slugger?). Like I said previously, laughter and subtle flattery is a good way to keep a person talking to you. If a text message can make them smile, you can easily do it in person.   Here’s probably one of the best pieces of advice you will find in this guide: you need to make them feel important. There is a book called  How to Win Friends & Influence People  by Dale Carnegie, it’s awfully popular. Let me ask you, what is the greatest desire of a human being? Money? Sex? Power? Happiness? No. If you think about this (and I’m not forcing you to agree, just acknowledge the idea), the greatest “want” of people is  the desire to feel important . Let that sink in for a second… That is the general idea I had picked up from reading Dale Carnegie’s book and it applies greatly to this situation. So, how do we make her feel important? You'll want to ask her questions and continue wanting (or pretending to want) to know more about them. It's NEVER about you, unless she wants to know more (in which case, you’re moving up the ranks). Remember, if you want them to text you first (your ultimate goal), then they at least need the desire to want to know more about you.   Step 4: Repetition  Here's the actual strategy! The whole basis of the guide itself. I noticed a pattern and through repeated trials it turned out to be effective. Pick a number of days, particularly ranging from 10-14. This is where you need to be a “pest” and where you'll need to be as charming and funny as possible. Crank it up a few levels. Set the day you expect to finish on a calendar. CIRCLE IT! Now, here's the main deal: text them EVERYDAY leading up to the final day. That’s my whole strategy. Each day she should be sending you 4-7 more texts (about 40 more minutes of texting each other a day).   After about 3 days, you need to change up your style a bit. Instead of asking her objective questions like, "When's the test?" to start up a conversation, you need to start with something like, "Hey! What's up?" I find this difficult, because it signalizes that you are texting her because you WANT to talk to her, not because you NEED information. The line between objective and subjective texting is thin. It's hard to turn back after this point, mind you. Your gut will tell you when you need to switch. You can’t skip out on “making the switch,” it's essential to getting her to want to text you. After you reach the halfway on your chosen amount of days, you have got to go for it. Good luck.   Step 5: Moment of Truth  So, you've followed the previous 4 steps, and you glance at your calendar and see that judgment day has come. Right now, throw away ALL temptation to text her! DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT text them on the final day! If you do, you've ruined the whole point of this process. Mind you, this has worked every single time I've attempted it, yet even I still get nervous and doubt the strategy on the final day. You need to wait. You'll be periodically checking your phone and you'll want to text her. Don't do it. You must wait. Let me let you in on a secret… 8:00 is a mystical time for women. Something strange about that time, because almost every girl I've tried this method on texts me around 8:00. If the girl does text you, you've succeeded. Even better, if she texts you with, "Hey,  your name !  " (count the y’s on “hey”) or something similar, give yourself a pat on the back. You've done it.   Step 6: Follow Up  So, you're at step 6 and feeling awfully great, aren't you? Good. But don't start feeling like you've won! The next day after she texts you first, you text HER first. Then, she will feel obliged to text the next day after that. Now, you can begin celebrating. From this point onward, you are texting buddies. Congratulations, champ!   If you read this whole guide, thank you for at least taking it into consideration! If you think it’s complete malarkey, well then don’t follow it and move on. If you are actually going to give it a shot, trust that it has worked several times.   Give me some feedback if you have any. Thanks for reading, guys!
Since I believe being giving constructive criticism is way better than destructive criticsm I decide to write something nice for the IPL 'caster' Hattperson.   Dear Hattperson, I recently noticed this thing you do on streams. Some people call it casting. I can only compare it to the sound Nicki Minaj makes under the shower. It is terrible. You do not say anything insightfull about the game. You do not use anything compared to a normal voice. Instead you scream like a 4 year old that just got his candy stolen. And you don't scream in a good way like those korean casters. When you scream it is always about stupid stuff. ('LOOK OMAIGAWD THEY BANNED VLADIMIR TOLDYATOLDA MWUAHAHAHA WOW LOL'). I understand that you can get excited sometimes when something happends you dont expect but when you have to understand. That when you don't know anything about the game (and believe me, you don't) that happends alot. The worse thing is, when RedBaron (I know some people here also don't like him that much, but he actually does very well) actually starts to explain stuff to you and the viewer about plays, items, team composition. You start interrupting him with your stupid yelling and the poor guy is just like 'wtf let me talk plz'.  Please, Hattperson, don't only stop with screaming, or interrupting redbaron. Quit casting, you are terrible at it. Do not stick with casting because you believe you can 'learn' because the world sometimes just doesn't work that way. A 600 elo scrub will never beat Reginald mid. Just quit.   Thanks in advance, People with ears and people who like to watch league
I've worked with computers for approx. 15 years. I've got loads of experience with both Mac and PC. I've owned half a dozen Apple computers. I simply do not buy the claim that Apple computer are "better" or "specialized" for photo/video editing. I'll break down my points:     Hardware: There is nothing that sets apart an Apple computer from its PC counterpart these days. Intel chips are not proprietary. The video cards are used in PCs. Firewire cards can be purchased for PCs and even come standard on some.     Operating System: I can't see a possible, logical argument here. The operating system is in no way "tuned" for video editing. Mac OS X is (correct me if I'm wrong here) running a modified linux kernel. In a sense it's a highly customized linux distro.     Display: I've heard that Apple displays offer better color clarity and depth. What a red herring. Why couldn't one purchase a high quality monitor and calibrator for a PC?     Software Availability: The majority of video/photo editing software available for Macs are available for PCs. And don't feed me the "Photoshop runs better on a Mac" line without benchmarks.     Intuitiveness/Ease of use: A lot of people claim iPhoto and the built-in Mac software is easy to use. Nonsense. You can take fifteen minutes and install open-source editing software on a PC that's just as user-friendly. Besides, I doubt the pros are using iPhoto.       So... why do people still insist Macs are superior for these things?   EDIT: Mac OS X appears to be based on a modified UNIX kernel. Doesn't change my original point.   EDIT2, REVENGE OF EDIT: Not trying to ignite a PC vs. Mac flame-war, just curious as to people's opinions strictly regarding video/photo editing.
Funny story time.  My dad had asked me a few weeks before the N64 launch if I'd be okay if he sold our sega stuff to get one.  Of course!  Launch day came and the sega stuff was all gone.  He got home from work and after watching tv a little bit he says "Hey, can you run down to the car and grab my wallet?"  So I go to the stairs and what is on the top landing?  N64 with Mario!.... I smiled and kept walking down the steps.  I got to the bottom and he shouted "Did you find it!?"  "Um... no, I didn't get to the car yet"  "No... no, I don't really need my wallet."  Then it clicked.   Similarly when he got me the snes for christmas I had already seen it in the closet weeks after we rented one from the local video store.  My reaction was "Mom, dad? shouldn't this have gone back?"  I got the snes and four opened games that year including FF2 that my mom had already put 12 hours or so on...
The main reason its oft repeated is its not microsoft published or developed, its EA, The greediest most money hungry corporation on the face of the earth, no way they are going to stick with only one console on this when A the ps4 seems to be outselling the xb1 3 or 4 to 1 and B its fucking EA, they would port this shit to dreamcast if they could, theyre a business, money is all their shareholders will understand.   Microsoft just paid for timed exclusivity, i dont beleive any of the hype about them needing the cloud to make it run when its going to be released on the 360 and pc as well
Throwaway since she is also an avid redditor.   I've started seeing this girl that I have plenty in common with, we both enjoy each others company and find one another to be very easy to talk too. I asked her if she would be interested in dating and she was definitely into it! Which is great however, I don't date often and I'd like to not screw this one up.   After doing some light research I've got two questions that I couldn't find answers to on my own.   I've read that introverts need time to themselves to "recharge" after doing anything with people. What exactly does that mean? I've read that it could be anything from just quiet time with their partner reading a book. To absolute solitude.  If this turns into a serious thing will she eventually be comfortable enough with me that she can "recharge" while I'm around?   Second question involves intimacy and sex. Do introverted people and sexual appetites have any relation? I've always read that a healthy sex life is key to a healthy relationship. I know I have a larger appetite than most but I'm fine slowing it down. We've spoken about it a few times and she hasn't done anything with anyone, she said that the idea of it makes her really nervous. I told her we won't do anything she isn't ready for. But I don't think I could take on a sexless relationship.
Actually, having created a pretty decent-sized artificial lake (bigger than an ocean, IIRC) from scratch - I think destroying the world would actually be the LESS time-consuming part. The aforementioned lake - a tiny fraction of the world - took hours to fill automatically. I probably could've done it better (not a pro at water duplication) but I think I had a decent setup. What's more, water levels are stored in bytes for each tile, meaning that over a very large area (like, say, the world) you'd get some rounding error if you tried to do it all at once, so you'd have to split the world into many columns and fill each individually.

I will update with audio comparison links when I get off mobile   I was debating whether to direct this to "non-Japanese", but the input from Japanese speakers, both second-hand & native, is also of great value.   I often compare by English performance reference, as I don't understand the language. JP "sounds" better in anime, but also for Batman ( live ,  The .   It's an odd comparison to the US (& lesser extent Canada) dubs, as...     ... while it's generally agreed that LA is top-of-line in entertainment , the progression of good casters->writers->directors->actors->sound engineers (what makes VO good)  costs money, which anime rarely has  - anime is not seen as a respectable production by our top brass, as historically the Japanese keep to themselves & don't put in money to spread their material.     SAG-AFTRA VO rates are such:   dub  -  $64.50/hour+$21.50/episode - 2-hour minimum   game  -  $400/hour - 2-hour minimum IIRC   live-action ADR  -  $890/ep   animation  -  $890/ep+ actor residuals ,   *commercials** pay ~1k IIRC+plus 1000's of residuals.     Most dubs are non-union ( barring  union talent by definition),  $50/hour flat.  J-game dubs are often non-union, & usually ~200/hour.     (Canada's domestic-TV laws afforded for higher union dub rates - ~$500/ep animation, ~$400/4-hour dubs)   I don't know exactly about Japan, but I believe that  $150/ep was base, & mid-to-high-demand VA's got 3-5x scale, the way that US agents demand.   A-list VA's are generally better, & studio budget helps.
This is probably going to get buried but this will be good to get off my chest.   It was probably when I had started to become angry and annoyed with my ex, rather than feeling happy and content.   My ex girlfriend and I were dating for about a year and a half. We were best friends throughout our first year of college, and we still kept in good contact despite the fact that she dropped out in the winter term. When we had decided to become an item, I had just turned 20 years old.   At first, we were on cloud nine. We were both madly in love with one another and we were each other's first serious relationship. For both of us, it was also the first time that either one of us shared intimate moments together. Thank God for residence life!   Unfortunately, the cards were stacked up against us from the start. One of the reasons why she dropped out of school the first time was because of her family life. Her parents were going through a very messy divorce and her Dad was leaving the family to go marry an Eastern European girl who was living in Florida. Her Mom struggled with finding work and somewhere cheap to live, despite the fact that she had cash to go party and mingle with friends. (WTF?)   Due to her family life and a good chunk of her childhood, my ex was/still is a sufferer of depression and anxiety. By the time college started, she was given a diagnosis for non verbal learning disorder. For the longest time, she had struggled heavily with school, and no one could help her. Her Mom always said that her mental health issues started when she had a concussion after smashing her head on a floor when she was younger. Yeah...okay?   When my ex and I moved into an apartment to go to school together, we thought it would be a wonderful concept. She would be away from her family for a while and I would be her better half. We'll be going into a program that we'll love to work in and it'll be all good!   Oh, how stupid was I. She had struggles with her school work and despite encouraging, helping, and driving her to school to do her work, she would hand in incompletes. Her moot points were brutal at times, too. Sometimes, she'd forget her meds and be slow and tired. Sometimes, she would cry for no reason whatsoever. I felt awful when that happened, but I didn't know what to do.   I even took my own personal time away just so I could call and ask her if she was alright and if she was doing her work. The worst was during an early family Christmas gathering that I went to where I spent 75% of it calling her. Is this what I really wanted in this relationship?   After a while, I started to slowly resent my ex. When her Mom was trying to get my ex on a disability program, I was calling my ex to make sure she was alright. She was crying over it because her Mom was getting overwhelmed with trying to find paperwork to support her daughter's case. Eventually, I noticed that I was getting angry with my ex and it was after that phone call that I thought that this relationship isn't going to work.   It took the whole winter term this year to finally call it off and for the most part, I'd say that I am a hell of a lot happier. On the other hand, I have often wondered if this is as good as it's going to get for me. It seems that all of the women that have been attracted to me are either mentally unstable or high maintenance. I know it's silly to say but I do often wonder if there might be something wrong with me. I look at other guys and I see that they are content with either sleeping around or by being in a stable relationship. I'm not sure if I want either or if I know what I want to begin with, anymore.
Creating an account with GFWL was an absolutely horrid experience. I don't remember all the details, but it went something like this. It was probably 3 or 4 years ago when I first got a GFWL game, I can't remember what it was though, maybe it was Street Fighter 4. Anyway I click the create account or whatever button from the in-game overlay and it takes me to...   A 404 page. I refresh a few times but nothing. So, ok, I go to Google and search games for windows live. However, back then, I think they had recently merged GFWL and xbox or something, so I was confused when I was being redirected to xbox.com.   I realised, ok, I just make an xbox live account then, so I did that. Here's where the real fun starts: after hitting the create or ok or whatever button... 404 page. Oh, okay, just a one off error or something, not sure what that's about, let's go sign in from the in-game overlay, it probably created just fine.   Of course, I get some error code that I don't remember now, but it was a link which linked to... you guessed it: 404. Okay, let's see what happens when I log in on the xbox site - this account doesn't exist. That's strange, because if that were the case wouldn't it say that from the overlay, not just a random error?   Whatever, seeing as it apparently doesn't exist, let's create a new one. I fill in all the details again and I get 'this username has already been taken'. Wow, what? I created an account, get a 404 page after creation. Now my account half-exists; impossible to log into, but my username is taken by it so I can't fucking create a working account.   So to circumvent this I had to make another account with another nickname, but the problem now was that my e-mail was taken by the half-existent account, so I had to make a new e-mail which was annoying, just for GFWL. Finally, that worked for me. No 404 page after creation.   Of course a couple years later I got into the AOE:O beta and decided that since I couldn't remember the details to the account I made for SF4 (or whatever that first game was) I would try making a new account. I wasn't really expecting it to work, but I tried my normal nickname which had been taken by the half-existent account and this time it worked.   Not long after I tried to get Street Fighter 4 working with this new account and my save data wouldn't work with it, great. I decided not to waste my time trying to figure out how to migrate it, I would just start from scratch. But that story is the (primary) reason I hate GFWL. Not because reddit tells me it's bad, not because I love steam, or whatever else.   That was way longer than I was expecting it to be.
My roommate and I have lived together for about 3 years now, and she is the best friend that I have ever had. We're basically platonic soulmates.   When we first met she had a long distance boyfriend. He came to visit once or twice and I know they skyped pretty much every night, but other than that I never saw/heard from him. They broke up about a year ago. So, for the past 4 years we've pretty much seen each other every single night. She gets home from work about 11-12pm and I've gotten into the habit of waiting up for her so we can hang out a bit before bed.   For the past two weeks, though, she's been staying out later and later with a new guy. Sometimes she ends up at his place and doesn't come home at all. This is where the ridiculous worry comes in. When I don't know where she is or if she's coming home I get sick to my stomach with worry, wondering if she's been in an accident/raped and murdered/etc. I just can't get my mind to shut up about it, and I have trouble sleeping. If I do get to sleep I toss and turn and wake up every few hours wondering if she's home yet. This has happened before with other people she has casually dated, but I guess because it was more infrequent I just ignored it.   She had her boyfriend over to watch movies last night, and even asked if it was ok for him to spend the night (not that she needs my permission, but it would have been his first time over here and it was nice of her to ask). Then around midnight they decide to go out and get a drink, but she says they'll be back soon. By 3am they still aren't back, she hasn't answered a text I sent her earlier in the night, and I'm wracked with anxiety worse then ever before. I know logically they just got drunk and decided to go to his place instead, but my stupid brain can't stop imagining my best friend dead in a ditch somewhere.  I got 2 hours of sleep, woke up again at 5, saw they still weren't back, didn't get any more sleep that night. She finally texted me back around 9am, they were at his place, and the relief was intense and immediate.   She obviously hasn't done anything wrong and this is all on me. I feel like I basically act like this girl's mother, constantly needing to know where she is and what she's up to. I know this is ridiculous and crazy, but I don't know why I'm feeling this way or how to stop. I feel stupid even posting this, but it's eating me up and I need advice.
I need about a 0.01 degree of precision angular sensor, to track movements of hand adjusting the head of a ball joint chuck.  I am assuming I assume I am looking for a gyro with the lowest degree/sec/sqrt(hz).  I also have the ability to interface with matlab for signal processing.   Most of the ones I have found are digital or already have low pass filters, which I assume matlab would do a much better job.
So I am in Silver V, and trying to improve my game to hopefully get into gold someday. Now I have been doing well, carrying all my games and always going positive, but my last two games I lost and I couldn't really understand why it was.   Now here is what happened. The first time I went Nasus top, and whatdoyouknow they chose singed top. I thought ok I will just have to play really well and I can beat him. Well Within the first 5 minutes of the game I am already 5-0, and it only gets better. Their whole team is saying "report singed troll", and he brought revive and was just constantly running into my turret. This Singed ended up going 0-11, but he never gave up, and he actually won the game for his team. This is how he did it:   He would always keep his Q activated, and run through the waves of minions, past the turret. He would then sit in between the two turrets and kill wave after wave. As I saw it this left me with three options: stay at turret and fight off waves of minions, run after the singed and kill him, or ask my jungle to take care of it. Well my team was not doing great in the other lanes, so I told the jungle to let me handle it. Now, being nasus I decided that I would just stay at turret and get the free q farm. So I was doing this, but singed was persistent and I began to have trouble fighting off all these minions without any minions to help me (I kept running low on mana as well). So I decided I would take the second option and kill him. So I chased down singed (oh no) and killed him, then got back to farming. Singed used revive and within no time he was back between the turrets killing my minions. At this point I was really fed, and my team really needed my help. So I was forced to leave my lane and help my team, but singed just stayed there. He managed to push all the way to inhibitors all by himself by the end of the game, and all of the confusion he caused among my team resulted in his team winning as my team struggled to stop the singed push while team fighting.   After this game, I had lost all faith in this game, and thought that was the most unfair strategy I have ever seen. I decided I would play one more game, this time I grabbed malphite top, thought I would have some fun, and was devastated when I found that they picked singed. Then once again, the same strategy was enacted, and the singed won the game for their team again. After that, I am now considering quitting LoL altogether.   Now after that huge wall of text, I've come here to ask you guys for help. Have any of you seen this strategy before, and how would you beat it. It has me stumped. The obvious answer is to go someone ranged, like Jayce or Teemo, as that would most likely stop singed, but both times this happened the singed picked after me. Should I just always play a ranged top to make sure this doesn't happen to me again, or is there some simple solution to this strategy that I am missing. Thank you for reading this, and I hope you can help. I would also be interested to know if this strategy is ever used in higher elo matches.
Hey guys. I'm a 15 year old male and I am overweight. Are there any small changes I could make that would help me get more fit? For the past few months I've been trying to get as much exercise as I can and I consume calories carefully, however, my parents don't support dieting and won't let me eat different foods then what they make and forces me to eat the entire plate of food even if I refuse.   I don't know if BMI is seen as an accurate thing in this sub or whatever but it's 28.0 at 5'8" and ~184 pounds (fluctuates between 180-187, but maybe I just have a shitty scale).
Mine is people using the word 'bipolar' in the completely wrong context. I often hear  teenage girls saying stuff like 'ugh, I'm so bipolar today' or 'she's so moody, bipolar much!!!'   I feel like I can't say anything because I don't want to be 'that guy' who goes around flipping his shit, but seriously. Bipolar is the scariest shit I have ever encountered. You bet your sweet ass that shit is going to freak you the fuck out. Somebody else's bipolar isolated me, tried to murder me (a whole other story) and divided my family. It has  nothing  to do with your friend having a moodswing.
No.  If you don't like Christian language, then maybe Buddhist language will help you see his point: you can't initiate a sequence of events and extricate yourself from its karmic formations by claiming a higher moral ground.  If you push against something, you are a part of the sequence.  It's a sort of logic physics.  And the Pope is calling Catholics to not play in that sandbox and instead to use their speech to edify, because even shitty people have basic human dignity by virtue of being created by God.  And to defame is to engage them in a way that does not honor that dignity.  I'm pretty sure the Pope would advocate almost all attempts to stop these people.  But he's going to call on the West to clean its own house first.
Work sucked.  I was failing at every turn.  I had started strong a year or two ago and the sophomore slump was killing me.  My boss was up my ass  literally  every single day.  I was thinking about quitting.   I thought to myself "What was I doing differently before?"  The only thing I could think of was that I used to have a nice pen that I liked and a single notebook that I carried EVERYWHERE.  I thought, what the hell, I've exhausted every other possibility, lets give this one a shot.   So I went out on my lunch break and laid down some scratch on a fountain pen (It's a shitty fountain pen, but it was still like $30.  For a pen.) and a Moleskine notebook.   After lunch I unpackaged everything and put the ink in the pen.  Nice, smooth, liquid lines flowed onto paper.  (If you've never written with a fountain pen, I highly recommend it.  You know that satisfaction you get when you use a nice gel roller like a Pilot G2?  Yea.  Its that times a thousand.)   In the 2-3 weeks since I've been complimented, told I'm turning over a new leaf, and had my "Noticable change in communication style" commented on.  Its unreal.  And it all boils down to one thing.   I actually want to write things down now, and I have one central place to write them.   Thats it.  No more sticky notes all over my desk.  No more grabbing a random piece of printer paper to scratch out a quick diagram, no more stacks of notepads that are half used that I need to dig through when I need to get a reminder I wrote.  It's all in that one black leatherbound notebook.  And it's all in order, with dated pages.  In the morning I date a page, and write "Todays Goals."  Then I spend 5 minutes writing things that I need to do (and enjoying it, because writing is fun with nice pens.)  Then that notebook stays on my desk, open to that page, throughout the day.  If I glance in that direction, I'm presented with my list of things to do for the day, and think "Oh hell, that one would be easy to knock out right now lets do that."  I can use my distractability to my advantage because now Im getting distracted by work.   On top of that, it's always there to jot down notes. If someone comes in to talk about something, I take small notes here and there (a key word or two is usually enough to jog your memory later, you dont want them to think youre interviewing them.)  If I go to a meeting, I take it with me.  If I get a call, I jot it down.  If someone asks me about that thing we discussed yesterday, I flip to yesterdays set of pages and have an aide in recalling the conversation.  Something happened on a big project?  That shit gets its own page.   And it all boils down to one thing.  I'm using a pen and pad that's literally a pleasure to write with.  I enjoy it.  I thrive on the looks I get when people notice that I'm using a fountain pen.  It's so satisfying watching the liquid ink slide off the nib and lay up on the page, glossy and wet and black, and then slowly sink into the paper as I continue the sentence.  Its not a chore to make a list or a note anymore, it's enjoyable.   So yea thats my two cents.  Take $50 and blow it on a pen and a pad.  Do research before you buy.  Get excited about it.  There are articles online about the best notebooks.  Heres a good one on size.   You dont want something cumbersome but it still needs to be big enough to write on.  Mines ~5" x 8".  Fits nicely in your hand, and is big enough to hold substantial information on a single page.   Anyway, thats enough of me prattling on about notebooks.  Go do some research.
my ex gf found out her ex bf (not me) cheated on her because she still knew his fb password and was completely devastated.
About 10 days ago she called me telling me how much she missed me. I posted about it here:   I didn't tell her how much I missed her. I expected her to maybe try reaching out again. I waited 5 days and didn't get another call so I sent her a text that just said "hey". No response. I waited two more days and sent one that said "Can we talk?". No response.  Last night I did something really stupid. I decided to try to see her at her work. I walked all the way up to the door and decided it was a bad idea. I left, but in doing so she saw me drive by (twice, one to get there, one leaving.) She texted me and asked why I was there and I told her the truth. She replied with "Okay, Sorry". Then I asked her to call me which she didn't do.   I'm tired of looking so damn pathetic. I just blocked her again everywhere. Every time I think I'm okay, or that I've moved on, something takes me back and I fuck up.   I'm really not looking forward to Valentines day, or her birthday which is right after.
Me and 3 other friends play every monday, and every other tuesday (then at intermittent times through the week.) We really want to start practicing as a team (both ranked MM and practice outside of MM), but haven't been able to find our 5th man in pubs. Then I stumbled upon this subreddit!   We're looking to find someone who we enjoy playing with, and that we can stick with through thick and thin. We're all based in the midwest and have legitimate interest in driving to LAN's and such, so if you live nearby that's a bonus.   We haven't settled on any positions, but rather intend to draft around heroes we have expertise with, so we can work with whatever position. That said, preference for someone with a strong repertoire of mid heroes (we've got solid offlaners, carries, and some supports)   Mondays 6-9, every other tues 6-9 also. If you're interested, PM me/post your steam name along with your favorite quote about mental resilience. Those who tilt easily or enjoy bad-natured flaming need not apply.
Hello! ADHD-PI person here and omg are you me?? HERES MY LIFE STORY   I always used to have incredibly bad anxiety for like, my whole life, about pretty much everything. Hearing just the symptoms of a disease would send me into a panic attack, idea of contacting someone would make my stomach do flips, if I took 2 seconds too long for the teacher to collect my homework then I would leave it in my bag and take the F to avoid getting up in front of the class......haha yeah I thought I was just an insecure person with an anxiety disorder for the longest time!   Then near the end of my freshman year of highschool, my mom sent me to the school psych person to get tested for pretty much everything except adhd, and said my anxiety was at "Clinical" levels. So that qualified me to go into the Directive Resource class in Sophomore year! After being in there for a couple months and getting at least some help with my homework, the teacher said he thought I might actually just have ADHD. So I went and got tested and started seeing a legit psychologist/therapist person........and wow!! My teacher was right!!   I finished Sophomore year with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, but I waited until summer to actually start medication. Started on 30mg of Vyvanse, and holy shit it was like my whole world changed! Everything was much clearer, I was so much calmer, and nearly all of my anxiety went away! (I mean I still struggle sometimes with starting/continuing conversations both IRL and over text, but I think this might just be teenage awkwardness lmao) I'm now in my Junior year, and my grades are much better, I think I'm much happier, and a few people have even commented that I seem more self assured and calm than I used to be! Yay!!
I'll keep this brief.   My gaming/animating computer is in my kitchen, so I usually wait until my parents are in bed to... Get busy.   Now I've recently fine tuned the NVIDIA settings, and my computer is still adjusting. A few hiccups here and there, but it runs so much smoother. 80 FPS on Mirror's Edge, 30-45 while recording.   After both my parents are asleep, I load up my favourite website.   After many videos, I'm on the best one yet. Almost finished... My mother walks in.   MY COMPUTER FUCKING FREEZES.   I can't hit the close button in time.   As she walks in, it closes everything, and I'm leaning forward to hide my manhood.   Now keep in mind that because I'm worried about this stuff, I only undo my fly and keep a napkin around, so the grip of the zipper is... Well...   The handle of the zipper is being forced into the base of my dick.   FORCED INTO IT.   IT FUCKING HURTS, MAN!   As I'm leaning forward, everything hidden by the desk, I look back, and she's not paying attention, but obviously acting weird.   She's in the kitchen only a couple minutes, but the pain and humiliation made it seem like hours.   I went into the living room after, doing this whole "God dammit. I hate these email spam popups." thing. I seem to have her convinced it was a popup to some porn site... I'm pretty damn sure she knows what it  REALLY  was.   My dick hurts.   So much.
My dad and I have always had a great relationship when i was younger.  About 5 years ago his mother passed away, and he started drinking heavily (hes always been an angry alcoholic though.)My mother and father have never had a good relationship so a couple weeks later my mom and dad have a big fight and she throws him out, and he goes and lives with his father in a house around the corner. Ever since his mother died, as-well as me getting older our relationship has been getting worse and worse.   About my Senior year of high school all we seemed to do was fight and argue. By this time i'm 17 or 18 and i don't want to bother with someone who all they do is yell and curse you out for every little thing. About my second semester of high school my dad and i  have a big fight and under the influence if alcohol he tells me "i never want to see you again". Before he said this i would go to visit him 2x a week to check on him and my grandpa, so when he expressed how he felt i took his word for it and decided not to visit him anymore. A few weeks later a girlfriend convinced me to go to the prom with her, so my mom helps me out with getting my tux and and ticket, later i go to the prom and have an OK time.   My dad contacts me a month later acting as if nothing happened and as if we're friends again. He soon discovers that i attended the prom without his involvment. He says i look nice and it doesn't seem to bother him much. Weeks later in a drunken rage he returns my prom picture to me saying "i don't want this shit, you keep it." Ever since this incident and for the last few years he's been calling in drunken rages almost everyday cussing me out, calling me a "Pussy, Bitch, and going as far as "you're not my son." I used to love my dad and we used to best of friends like a father and son should be, but now with my aging into adulthood my dad and i have been growing more and more distant as-well as more hateful towards each other. He's recently been calling me saying our relationship will never be the same again and recognizes our distance between each other. I honestly can't say that i love my dad anymore, i just don't have that feeling.   Christmas is coming up next week, last year i didn't even get him a gift because we got so bad and this caused even more drunken rages. This Christmas i will get him a nice gift to show appreciation to him and try end the feud we have been having these last couple of years. I still need help Reddit. What should i do to fix this damaged relationship before we go our separate ways? Is it already torched and should i leave it be? Is this whole thing my fault because of the prom situation? Am i an asshole and a coward and deserved what happened? I'm turning 21 in February, I'm basically already a man and i'm willing to man up and squash this before it's too late and i'm gone forever. Honest Opinions. Thanks.
Was riding around on my friends land in her uncles 4 wheeler. Ran over a tire that was covered by tall grass and went sailing through the air. 4 wheeler ran over me. Get up extremely fast to tell myself I'm ok. I feel ok so fuck it lets get back to riding. Look down and my thigh is covered in blood and so is my leg. Oh fuck oh fuck! I get back on the 4 wheeler not wanting to see what damage is done until I get back to the house. Also on the 4 wheeler foot peg there was a chunk of meat. Get back to the house and my friend thinks I started the rag so she's trying to get me a towel and keep me outside from embarrassment. I tell her no it's my thigh. We go inside and her aunt who is a nurse looks at it while I look away. The faces they made said it all. I had to get stitches on the inside of my leg and outside. The scar runs from almost to the back of my thigh to the front. Also it dips in from the missing meat chunk that was gashed out.
Uh, I think we passed that point a while ago.  Plenty of people can't afford to not accept a job.  What I'm suggesting is that there would be significantly more jobs available if hiring weren't as difficult as it actually is.  For instance, to hire someone in a major city (blue-state, because that's all I'm familiar with) it will take at least a month of paperwork to background check, tax file, interview to 100% certainty, possibly drug test, contact references, and work out benefits (mountains of paperwork.)  Most of that work is done because firing someone is nearly impossible unless you want to face lawsuits and even if you win you're out the time and money of fighting it.  I haven't worked with a company that hasn't had in-house legal in decades, and the reason they are there is to handle the  liability  of hiring in a market where the regulations require a full-time employee to track them.   It's easier to  not  hire someone and simply dogpile work on the employees you have, knowing that they'll do it because there's a line around the block of people waiting to take their position if they don't like it.  You can have whatever feelings you like about this, but it's a stone-cold fact.   I recall trying to simply make ends meet and going door to door asking if there was any work to be done, cleaning, moving,  anything  and although I could get a few bucks for doing a once-off, it was impossible to get a regular job even for part-time because nobody wanted to pay minimum wage.  I  didn't want  minimum wage, I wanted  anything  because I was hungry, but that law blocked me from scraping a living for myself.
Despite what the law says in whatever part of the world that one resides, copyright laws in respect of "you copied my artwork" are not generally laws enforced by law enforcement - it is up to the copyright holder to take the offender to court and face a civil trial where they may/may not win the case (unless an agreement has been reached beforehand) and possibly face many appeals until the highest court in the jursdiction makes its ruling and then that judgment has to be followed.   For a copyright holder, this can be an expensive experience that doesn't guarantee that offending items will no longer be sold until the outcome of a judge's decision is reached; means spending lots of money on lawyers in the field of copyright and arguing their case in court, and going through the legal process that could take months or years to go to court.   If a copyright owner believes their copyright has been infringed, they can (normally through their lawyers) send a "letter before action" - a letter that effectively says "oi you, stop it or i'll take you to court". If the offender continues, it is again up to the copyright owner to pursue legal action.
I was at our schools presentation night and the previous week I had asked  Mrs Jones (the teacher running the night) if I could present my Mark Antony monologue which I had gotten top mark for in class. she said no, because my monologue was sad and she didn't want to depress the audience. But I knew it was because she didn't like me.   I was backstage helping out with mic's when the drama acts were about to go on, there were only two. While the first girl was performing her Cleopatra monologue the second girl got severe case of stage fright. She was freaking out. I'm talking heavy breathing, about to cry kind of freaking out. My drama teacher turned to me and said "you've got got to go on, she can't do it." I froze, this was a joke, come on. But it was no joke, I didn't know what to do, could I remember all of my lines? "I can't" I said. But my teacher had different ideas "Jill can be the body. Go!" Before I could protest he pushed me and I staggered onto stage. The room fell silent as a hundred pairs of eyes locked onto me, I could've ran, but I didn't, I saw no turning back. I walked to the centre of stage, remembering my lines, I looked up at mrs Jones, she was shaking her head in a 'you're so fucked when you get of stage' kind of way.   "Hello, I will be presenting Mark Antony's speech from Julius Caesar" I said to the audience. Jill laid down in front of me "thank you" she mouthed.   I started reciting the monologue out loud, the way I practiced in class. "Friends, Romans, countrymen lend me your ears! I come to bury Caesar, not praise him...   I finished and the room filled with applause. I gave a bow. Me and Jill walked backstage again. She hugged me "thank you!" She walked on and presented her monologue without flaw. I cured her stage fright, and got to perform, win-win I guess, and it was truly badass.
In Texas - Have been stopped 3 times after getting my CCW permit. (Twice though were due to an oxidized license plate cover that I keep forgetting to replace.)   Each time when the officer came to my window I had my permit, license and insurance in my hand ready for him.  Each time I was asked "Do you have your weapon with you?" To which I always responded in the affirmative. The next question was always "Where is it?" After informing of "console, door pocket and laptop bag" (3 different places due to traveling on different stops) I was never asked to produce it. Only once was I asked to exit the car, and then it was because he wanted to show me why my license plate cover was illegal.
Hello, today I'm going to talk about the Futurist Party in the sidebar.   So I bet a lot of you are not just interested as hell about everything you read about on this sub, but want to be the ones that bring this stuff into reality, but are not sure how to go about doing that. There are plenty of ways to do that, find schools that have the relevant degrees, companies/foundations that work on the stuff you're interested in, etc. But, there is always room for things like research into artificial intelligence and radical life extension to expand (and have an even greater chance of being known). And so we have the goal of the Futurist Party: to get these kind of things known about and to actively further progress into things like research and education reform. You'll be joining a political party with like-minded people oriented on getting stuff done. Currently, the party is not that very well known, so I am here to help, and point some of you guys in the right direction. Anyways, I hope to see some of you there :)
Thats really not true.   Intersex and trans people exist. The presence or absence of a vagina doesn't make anyone a "real woman." That is just crap. I don't see how this could be either funny or upvoted.   Edit: To be clear, there are lots of ways we can look at human / sex gender, and there are lots of variations to occur. Nothing is any less real about people when their parts don't match, rather it be their DNA or their genitalia. These people may not be the majority, but they are no less real. And due to these variations there have been many attempts to define human sex. One attempt has been to look at DNA, the XX/XY genes which many people are familiar with. This is the XX/XY sex-determination system, but it isn't actually used and here is why:   (And yes, I did copy/paste this from a previous response. Their question was "If you were to take a DNA swab of any woman, what sex would the DNA results tell you?" However, copying/pasting makes things no less real -- my meaning here being no less true. :))   If people want to read more / learn why determining sex in human beings is not so simple, they can start here: If you were to take a DNA swab of any woman, what sex would the DNA results tell you? And after that, what relevance does it have to her being a woman, to her sex/gender? It is a false conclusion that DNA is relevant to the relationship, sexual attraction, or the determination of gender/sex.   There are all sorts of genetic variations in women. Geneticists don't use chromosomes to determine sex/gender in people. It isn't known to be an accurate indicator. Genes are just a map, or a plan even. It doesn't mean that the plan is followed. Phenotype is a far more determining factor of sex/gender than DNA (edit: or any other single factor) ever will or could be. We don't karyotype people with our eyes or beliefs, contrary to some claims in this thread. What relevance does someone's DNA have on their sex/gender/appearance/etc? Everything you see and interact with about a person can be completely opposite of what their genes tell you should be reality. (Gattaca anyone?)   For the majority, their chromosomes may be in line with what you see. But that doesn't prove anything about the relationship between DNA and sex/gender. There are plenty of women, trans and otherwise, that do not match. (Men too for that matter.) There is such thing as an XY woman.   Also sex/gender is far more than just chromosomes. Neurology plays an extremely important part, and that is the part that does not match in trans people. Neurology is going to form the foundation of your identity/gender. And neurology is the component of trans women that does not match (possibly) their DNA.   In real life, when people do gender tests, it takes a wide range of doctors/specialists to make the determination. And it should be noted that the medical community accepts the validity of transsexuals as women. gender verification tests typically involve evaluation by gynecologists, endocrinologists, psychologists, and internal medicine specialists. As you can see, there is far more to gender/sex than genes. Making that determination isn't the job of geneticists either. Not to mention, it can be incredibly inaccurate even still.   Gender verification tests are difficult, expensive, and potentially inaccurate. Furthermore, these tests fail to exclude all potential impostors (eg, some 46,XX males), are discriminatory against women with disorders of sexual development, and may have shattering consequences for athletes who 'fail' a test.   DNA is an irrelevant piece of the gender/sex puzzle when it comes to sexual attraction as well (or any human interaction.) As I already pointed out, what people are attracted to (and what they interact with) is the person's phenotype -- "the composite of an organism's observable characteristics or traits: such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, phenology, behavior, and products of behavior..." And that can obviously be changed in the case of a congenital neurological intersex condition, like transsexuality.   Biological determinism (basically the idea that you are what your DNA says) is not an accurate view of humanity. In fact "Biologists sometimes regard a charge of biological determinism as a straw man, as there is currently no support for strict biological determinism in the field of genetics or development, and virtually no support among geneticists for the strong thesis of biological determinism. "
You can't just jump to a conclusion without any concrete proof. Put a hidden camera by the sock drawer, now it all depends where he jerks off into the socks. If he jerks off in front of the sock drawer (he's an idiot if does), keep the footage, put it on a dvd. Now you can do 2 things with this, you can either leave it in his room and title it "We know...", or you can ask him to watch a movie with you guys, put the dvd in, and enjoy the look on his face, but most likely he's not gonna do it in front of the sock drawer. Get proof first, ask him what he's doing with the socks. If he denies it and you see it happen again, then switch your socks with his. I don't think he's going to like using sticky socks, but you know what? I personally think you should focus on stopping his marijuana usage. He's 13, I don't think he has a good job, if he even has one. Pot is really easy to get addicted to. He might end up stealing from you, if he hasn't already. Plus if he can't pay his drug dealers they might rob your house if they really wanted money from him.
Let me start off by saying I am a novice at best with computers. I do not know a lot about how stuff runs or works... But here we go anyways.. My friend built his own computer and has some decent hardware in it( he just bought a gtx 660 sc, an asus motherboard and I think 8 gigs of ram. He is currently running Windows 7 64 bit.) He has had a problem where no matter what application or game he is running, it will minimize him every 10-15 min. No error codes pop up at all.. it just minimizes it and he has to reopen what ever it is he was doing... it is really irritating and frustrating.. any ideas or suggestions? Thanks in advance!
I honestly think "cooking at home" is a built in excuse for most hamplanets.  I enjoy cooking on the weekends but I work 9-10 hour days at my business and the last thing I want to do at 7:30 when I get home is cook a meal or heat up leftovers.   Usually a protein bar and a banana on the way home from work, before hitting the grocery store, satiates me enough to not go wild at the grocery store and buy a bag of chips and dip (or similiar)   There's a million ways to lose weight, "cooking at home" can be a tool for good or bad.  Like with pasta for instance it's very hard to only cook up one 250 calorie serving, so at least when I make it, if I'm not cooking for others, I tend to eat the entire bowl I just made, which is probably around 1000 calories.   I'd have been better off just grabbing a couple burgers for dinner.
He wouldn't keep up with AM if he skipped midas, AM is farmer by nature, Timbersaw is not. He got it around 9 min, meaning, at 25~ it payed itself from the bonus alone, that doesn't count the massive exp put into timberchain/w. death which helps him farm (and kill heroes) a lot.
I wasn't sure what subreddit to put this in, but wait! Hear me out!   We've all believed that if we just had that one chance, the one date to sweep the celebrity off his/her feet, they'd instantly recognize us as THE ONE. C'mon, you've thought it. So, on my Cake Day, I'm hoping you guys can help me see if this theory holds.   Some facts about myself: I'm in my mid-20s, I'm from Texas, I live in Brooklyn, and I like music. My dream has always been to play drums for a pop artist, go on tour, and just play fun songs when no one is really there to see me. She's the best at what she does. How badass it would be jamming the chorus of "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" in front of 20,000 people and she looks back at me and winks to say, "Not you, babe"?   Let's give this thing some visibility and see what happens. Can you imagine if this works out? You, yes you, can say you gave me a boost with that little orange arrow. I'll remember you when frolicking in the Tennessee hills with Juliet herself. And when it doesn't work out, I'll give you stories of how she's actually a nice girl, who isn't obsessive and crazy (hopefully). And just imagine the song she's gonna write about the Reddit Boy.   So let's do this. She'll see it if we make it a big enough deal. And remember, this is for all of us, but mainly just for me.
I think this is an issue of fine art vs illustration. I had a friend who had to switch her major from illustration to fine art (long story) and spent a year stressed out and upset that much of what she learned didn't apply anymore because they have different priorities. (Also most of the students were pulling their deep interpretations out of their asses anyway but I digress.)   I don't find the portrait photos at all stunning. I admire her use of color, but her compositions don't draw me in.^(Ugh, I had the rule of thirds bitched into me two semesters ago so I can't take centered portrait photos anymore, uuuuugh.)
I've had my CPU for about a year and a half now (phenom 2 x4 975 be) and have always had temp issues. Core temp would give me really crazy readings of 70+ and the only way I thought such could be the case would be because the stock cooler was pretty terrible. So I went out and got my self the Coolermaster hyper 212 plus and some artic silver thermal paste. I had expected, since I don't overclock at all, that I'd have a major drop in temp, as there were fairly well recommended components.   I installed it about 4 hours from this post. It idles at 45 celsius and, when running GW2 in World Vs World, it went as high as 54 celsius. Knowing that the max temp is 62, this is okay but not great, and certainly not what I'd expect from a non OC'd CPU.   So I downloaded AMD overdrive to see what's really going on under the hood. Do these pages seem alright to everyone? These are completely default pages, no tampering at all. I feel like something is off with my Clock/voltage settings:   I'm thinking this should explain some heat issues if it turns out there's a problem.
Ryan was going to hurt and/or murder Claire in the finale? I know it sounds completely crazy, but hear me out.   In the dinner scene with the psycho twins, Ryan is forced to come to terms with his quest of revenge and absolution. From [25:55 to 28:08]( when Joe tells the story of the murder of Ryan's father, it is clearly visible that Ryan's entire demeanor changes, as well as the feeling within the room. Though Ryan admits that he's not a good guy consistently throughout the series, this was the first time that it seemed to be really out in the open.   For the first time, in my opinion, Ryan and Joe have  never been more similar.   After the epic shootout and what originally appeared to be Luke's fatal end, we all get to see Ryan finally confront Joe, with the chance to finally end Joe's life and his [Ryan's] internal suffering.   But slightly before that, Joe and Claire meet for what may be the last time of both their lives. Despite everything that Claire has done to Joe: attempting to murder, successfully murdering his "love interest," and frequently toying with his emotions, Joe does not act in anger or violence. Instead, he apologizes and begs for Claire to tell Joey that he is sorry for every wrong he has committed against his family.   The reason I find this so interesting is because based on Joe's previous instances, he shouldn't truly have any emotion towards Claire, especially not sorrow. But in this scene, he exhibits pure, unadulterated regret and for one of the first times in the series, he looks to be good. Perhaps it was another form of his manipulation or he believed that his death was imminent, but from my perspective, his plea seemed very genuine.   Moving back to the scene with Ryan and Joe, I think that scene was very important because it ties in with details I mentioned earlier and a theme that was constantly reinforced without the series - Ryan is literally nothing without Joe. Even when given the option to murder him, he shows hesitation and ultimately cannot bring himself to do it.   Why? Personally, I believe it's because he realizes that what Joe has told him is true. The death of Joe is permanent in nature and Ryan would have nothing left to live for, other than the life he has imagined with Claire. In that moment, he accepts that as truth and decides to have Joe placed in prison for life, as it gives Ryan another reason to live.   Now to the main point of this... In the aftermath of the shootout, we see Ryan walking around somewhat aimlessly outside of the mansion. Based on his normal characteristics, this seemed a bit unusual to me and gave me an uneasy feeling. His face was somewhat blank, as though he were deep in thought, though I admit that I may have looked too far into it. Eventually, he walks over to Claire and we all know what happens next.   Claire rejects and completely shrugs off any possibility of a life together. [During her explanation (35:52 - 37:45)]( Ryan's facial expressions were quite possibly the creepiest I had ever seen from him, as they were ones of complete and total devastation. Pay special attention to 37:19, where the background music slowly begins to rise in.. It's eery, and at the moment, I was almost positive that Ryan was going to have a moment similar to Joe's in Season 1, during the conversation that Claire and Joe had before she stabbed him.   Claire left Joe because he was a monster . It is safe to assume she is doing the same with Ryan after learning about his past during the final shootout. Take it how you want it, but I don't buy into this "oh, I suddenly go against everything I've been saying for the last two seasons" bullshit that seems to be accepted.   At the same time, it can be said that Ryan, at that moment, realized that he truly had nothing to live for at this point. His life, up until this point, has revolved around Joe & Claire. Everything he had been told and eventually believed (evident through his conversations with Mike) had just been revealed as untrue, and Ryan would not be able to simply move on.   LASTLY, it should be noted that Claire's reason for leaving was Ryan's initial reason for leaving Claire after Joe's original capture. If you recall, Ryan had a specific conversation with Claire in one of the initial episodes where he explains that if Ryan stayed with her, he would be a constant reminder of Joe. Now, despite everything that has happened, Claire has used the exact same argument to reject him. Based on his previous outbursts, I would think that would piss Ryan off.   Please tell me what you think, I'm really curious to see if I'm the only one who thought about this possibility.
That doesn't make sense. Ownership of ALL land works like that. You take away the Royals land and you have to completely reform the processes by which land has ever been allocated.   All land ownership comes down to some guy buying land, from some guy who bought land, from some guy who bought land, from some guy who bought land, from some guy who was given land, by some guy who claimed the land by force.   Where do you draw the line?

Moved to a new country for him, it's not working out and I want to go home.   I have a month long work assignment in my home country and I leave for that in 2 days.   I have a dog here who is very important to me.   I can't decide if I should 1) break up with him now and go through the stress of a last minute move with a dog (i would drop her off at my parents so i could go on my assignment), or   2) go on my assignment, fly back, break the news to him slowly, pack up and go home with the dog after a few days.   I feel like number one would be fast and cruel, but number two would mean he watched my dog for me for a month while blissfully awaiting my return. I would have to pretend for a whole month that I wasnt about to break up with him.   My main reason for the breakup is I hate this country and want to go back to the USA. He wouldn't move there for 3+ years, even though he doesn't need to work. This makes me feel bad because I feel like I tried harder. We also don't agree on what we want for the future.   What to do?   EXTRA IMPORTANT DETAIL:   My ticket for this trip was booked through an airline that doesnt allow dogs, so i would need to buy a new ticket. i have $60 to my name and the ticket on the airline that accepts dogs is $1300. So I technically dont even have a way to get home with the dog. after the work assignment, I will have $5000 and be able to buy a round trip ticket to come back for the dog and my stuff. He will not watch her if we break up though.
I'm a wana-be UI/UX designer. I basically just judge the shit out of applications and consumer products and overuse the sentence "Your shit sucks, fix it".
The introduction of alcohol to the bloodstream causes a  physical change  in the brain (contracting brain tissue, depressing the central nervous system, can destroy brain cells). The alcohol directly interferes with communication between nerve cells,  suppresses excitatory nerve pathway activity and increases inhibitory nerve pathway activity. Generally, alcohol will enhance the effects of your inhibitor transmitter (but also weakening your excitatory neurotransmitter glutamine), making you sluggish.  There's a lot more to it than this, as the brain is a very complicated piece of shit, but I'll stop here as my assumption is that someone who holds your point of view may not have the capacity to keep up.   As alcohol induces a physical change via foreign chemical transmission, it's rather safe to say that it isn't some hidden, uncensored part of you. If you have a piece of your brain removed and it turns you into a drooling retard, does this mean you were always secretly a retard? No. If you eat a heap of psychoactive mushrooms and start seeing everyone with rattlesnakes for arms, does that mean that deep down you secretly think everyone's arms are rattlesnakes? No. If you smoke some reefer and start walking around mindlessly in circles for an hour, does that mean your "true self" secretly thinks that's the most fun you can have? No.
All materials absorb some wavelengths, are transparent for some wavelengths are reflect some wavelengths.   Most solids are reflecting a tiny part of the spectrum and are absorbing the largest part. Mirrors are optimized to have a wide range of reflection centered on green. Glass is optimized to have a wide range of transparency also in the visible spectrum.   This is how IRM/x-rays works. We know many materials absorbtion and reflexion ranges. We fire photons of many wavelengths and we can know what material is inside things. We can also see heat trough walls as most materials are transparent in infra-red.
I work in retail and our company has a pretty stringent credit/debit card policy: we cannot enter the card number manually unless the card will not swipe properly. In other words, it is a last resort and the card MUST be present. So about a month ago, I was working at a different store location than where I work now (with the same store, but different town). We had just hired our seasonal workers and me and this girl, we'll call her Sam, got along really well. One day, on her break, she decided to make a purchase. She handed me her phone which had the notebook app open with a number on it. When I asked what it was, she told me that her debit card was stolen and she was in the process of getting a new one. I told her that we really weren't allowed to do that, so I turned towards my manager who was not ten feet away. He said to go ahead and do it. So I did it. A few days later, she handed me her phone again, and since I had already done it with manager approval, I figured it was alright. So I did it again.   As I said before, I work with the same company but in a different town. I came into work one night and asked my manager which register I'd be on for that shift. She said, "Oh not yet. I need to talk to you in the office." Let me tell you that I have NEVER stolen from my job, never "worked the system" in any way, so I thought it was for something good, like a promotion or a raise. But when we get into the office, there's a guy who I had never met before sitting at the desk with a laptop and on the screen is some sort of surveillance software. By this point, I'm thinking "what the hell?" but I kept a straight face and introduced myself. I learned that he was the Loss Prevention Manager for our district. He was asking me a lot of get-to-know-you questions and basically wasting my time. So I politely interjected and asked if I was in trouble, but he snubbed by question by saying, "I'll get to that." By that point my heart was pounding, I was really anxious because I don't do well with uncertainty. Eventually, he asked me, "What if a customer didn't have their card with them but asked if you could enter it in manually? What would you do in that situation?" I told hi that even though I know it is against company policy, I would ask the manager and then proceed from there. He then went on to tell me that they found me on camera doing just this thing, except he said that I didn't call the manager. I swear on my mother's life that I asked my manager. Yes, I didn't pick up the phone directly and call him, but that's because he was taking care of something at the front end, right near me! He wouldn't let me see the footage of this, which I thought was bullshit. He said he'd only show it if he had to go to court. He told me that the two numbers Sam gave me were stolen credit card numbers and the owners of those cards had disputed those charges and my company was forced to pay them back. Both of the purchases in question came to $50, which I had to pay back to the company AND I got written up. I nearly got fired, but because I am a good worker and my current manager vouched for me, I still have my job (thankfully).   What pisses me off the most about this situation is that I got played for a fool, tried to do someone a favor and it blew up in my face, and the fact that even though I paid my company back, I STILL got written up. Welp, lesson learned, I guess.
While I'm not against pulling him from the school if that's what you and your wife feel best, I do think there might be something to Occupational Therapy. Speaking as an adult with Asberger's Syndrome (high functioning autism spectrum disorder) I wish that someone had told my parents this when I was in school. There are several services that will screen your child for free (there are lots of signs we missed and because of this we're just addressing my AS) and help you find the help he might appreciate later in life.   (Also, your pocket book will thank you later. Most services only screen for free to a certain age and the screening/testing is VERY expensive if you have to pay for it yourself. Just something to mull over)
The Rundown:   A week ago I was charged with possession of paraphernalia (Marijuana for those curious). This is my first offense. In Minnesota, where I live and study, this is considered a petty misdemeanor which does not technically qualify as a crime. I'm currently 20 years old and going into my sophomore year of an electrical engineering degree.   The Question:   So, my question to you, reddit: 3 years from now, when I'll be seeking employment, how much will this charge come back to hurt me? I know this is gonna make my life harder and I've made some really stupid decisions that I intend to never make again, but I don't want this to mean I won't be able to get the career I seek.
I think we can all agree that if Harry died for good the ending would be much more heart wrenching and emotional - to a certain degree, we base the 'worth' of a movie/game/book/etc on our emotional reaction to it.   Therefore, and this might sound weird, it would almost  seem , in a sense, a bit more gratifying to have him die as we're reading the book through for the first time. Yes, everyone would be extremely sad and depressed, but the sense of something  really  striking happening would've been starkly conveyed to us. It's easy to achieve a very heavy meaning if you're to kill of the main character(s). I won't deny it would've been very powerful.   However, JK Rowling's ending is, IMO, just about the best it could've been. I have a number of reasons for this, but they all come back to a simple fact - Harry's journey was not one of fear, secrecy, or a desire for power or immortality. It's established very early on that he has something that Voldemort  doesn't  have. The fact that the only one Voldemort ever feared, Dumbledore, absolutely insists that Harry has the most powerful sort of magic available is not something to gloss over.   It wasn't obvious at all when any of us read the books for the first time or even got to the end of the series, but think about it - would it  really  have made any sense at all to take Harry through a series that consistently capitalized on the virtues of the will to keep fighting and fighting, even through the darkest of darks, only to drop that theme completely at the end in favor of him dying? Harry is a symbol. Humanity has long believed that in a battle of light vs. dark, good vs. evil, life vs. death, the more virtuous option  always  comes out on top.   It might not be immediately apparent. It might even take hundreds of years, but eventually those who suffer get redemption.   Dumbledore had a great quote in book 6: > Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants  > everywhere do, by acting on the prophecy! Have you any idea how  > much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that,  > one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who  > rises against them and strikes back!   I'll conclude with this, and it'll be my
We just signed up from Verizon to Sprint's $100 for unlimited everything plan for two lines. We both got iPhone 6+ for $300 each. Asked the rep if that is all the charges and he said yes except for taxes and insurance.   Yesterday I got a Sprint reminder text saying that there would be a $25 per line charge since we got discounted phones. Can someone who got their bill already confirm this? If this ends up being the case, I'm furious since I asked the rep twice if there are any more charges. I need to know if this text is legit before I have to bust in the Sprint Store with my game face on.   EDIT: Ok guys the saga continues. I was still worried based on what was said below that the $25 per line charge would still be there so I went back to the Sprint Store. It's a third party store by the way, not a corporate store. I talked to the rep who sold it to me about the text I got and how it was now showing on my plan. He was genuinely baffled and a little angry about the situation, not me. He opens the account and he sees the charges. He then attempts to delete them. He is successful but since you guys below said that it was scripted and would still show I had him refresh my account to see if they were there. It showed again. He then said he doesn't know what to do and that he was really sorry.   I told him that we had two options. We find a way to waive the fees or I need a full refund on all. He said to call sprint care and ask what can be done. I called the number while in store. I talked to a lovely rep who was very kind but like what was said below, she also couldn't take it off. She then wanted to talk to a manager at the store since I mentioned I was ready to walk. I go back in the store and there is not a manager there so I told her that the guy who sold it to me was there. Once he got the phone, some hell broke loose. I could tell she was berating him about the misinformation. She told him to call the National Sales Support Team and beg they take them off.   He proceeds to call the NSST and they talk back and forth for about five minutes. The in store rep is basically begging the NSST rep to get this taken care of since I would be walking. The final verdict was that this $25 per line charge would expire Fed 2nd and that I would be credited for the first two bill cycles. And would then not show up on any future bills. Reluctant to believe them I got both agent names and agent numbers and he noted on the account exactly what was said. Now I have to hope the NSST rep is being honest. Any Sprint employees have history with this NSST that can tell me if this is legit or not?
Hello everyone, so recently I have had struggle climbing in ranked queue.  For the past 5 months right before season 4 started I've been in Gold 1. I've been demoted into Gold 2, 3 times and always climbed right back up to Gold 1, but never further.  I feel like I spend so much time learning and practicing the game, but for me to achieve my competitive drive I have to feel like I'm succeeding with all the practice. The past 5 months just haven't been that way. So I'm giving myself a big challenge of playing nothing but ranked for a whole month and streaming while I do it. I find that streaming helps me talk through my thought process and keeps me less on tilt if I go on a loss streak.  If I finally hit plat at some point during the month I'll have succeeded my goal and strive further. However if I am unsuccessful I will be mainly switching over to Starcraft 2 again. Where I will most likely be streaming my process of relearning the game (Was Masters Zerg in Wings of Liberty). I hope you will join my stream throughout the month and I hope I can be entertaining while giving good information as well as winning the games XD Thank you.
My 79 Camaro]( My dad was the original owner, and gave it to me to take care of.   50 grand you say? Where do I begin. I would start with a full out restoration, and get the car looking back to factory new. Some of the interior needs to be replaced such as the carpets which are worn bare in some places, and the headliner has almost fallen completely down. Much of the plastics have been sun damaged and cracked such as the center console, moldings in the back etc. Those all need replacement. I would replace the A/C unit because it sucks ass, and the gears freeze up causing the belt to stop and whenever the A/C is on it damn near kills the engine at an idle. All the seals around the doors, windows, t-tops, and trunk need replacement since they've rotted quite a bit. I also need to replace all of the speakers since they're dead. Id contact a vintage audio shop that knows how to put a modern stereo unit in whilst keeping the stock appearance. The bezels around the headlights, grille, etc need to be re-chromed. The lower grille is missing entirely. The engine needs a good tune up, sounds like its missing. I want the engine bay cleaned out and looking new. Hoses, belts, fluids etc need replacement. Id like to put a new cam in it and increase the compression, because the horsepower its putting out is pathetic and it could get taken by a minivan. The exhaust system is mostly shot. Both mufflers need replacement, pipes, tips, and the brackets are loose/broken so one kinda shakes to the left and right when you hit a bump. All 4 tires need replacement. You probably cant tell by the pics provided, but those tires are  over  15 years old, close to 20 I believe. The shocks are so shot, when I drove my friends around and hit a bump the entire car shuddered it hit so hard. Those need replacing. I replaced the disk brakes in the front, and I am not sure of the state of the drums in the rear. The paint is in okay condition, except in the front where it has chipped off due to the bra that used to be on it. I'm assuming I've gone over budget or at least close to it by now, but if I haven't I'd probably re-shoot the car, exact same color. I want to keep it numbers matching.
It can be a big deal, and that's fine.   I was just pointing out to the other comment that while it may be difficult for him (and others in this thread) to believe that someone made the accomplishment didn't shout it from the rooftops or stream it (according to this "unknown" possibility by Bash), it's harder for someone like me to believe that everyone who could do so would want to shout it from the rooftops.   As in, some people don't care about the achievements or whatever and just do it because they like playing the game and enjoy the challenge, but don't like or care for the recognition for doing so.   It being a generational thing because such "world firsts" have always existed, but were never streamed or the people accomplishing it may not have cared to tell anyone or perform in a public arena.
I've been dating this guy for 5 months and we spend practically every moment together. A few weeks back he wanted to goto a dub step concert with a friend of his who he has told me numerous times surrounds himself with strippers and X. Apparently this guy makes a habit out of feeding strippers X till they can't walk. My bf told me he would probably partake in the drug (no issue with the drug btw). My issue was the person he was going with and the fact that when my bf gets on X he's EXTREMELY emotional and touchy feely. I told him I didn't feel comfortable with him going and it turned into a drop down fight. Eventually he relented and didn't go. The bf says he doesn't support his friends lifestyle yet for some reason is getting involved with it.   A few weeks later a friend invited me to his shows after party. My bf brought up the dub step concert and used it as a reason why he didn't want me going so without a fight I said fine and didn't. Now tonight he texts me and tells me not to bother getting him from work cause he's going to a different dub step concert with this same friend and that I shouldn't expect to see him tonight. I don't want him to go for obvious reasons and do not trust his friend. I also don't trust him going to a rave on on X surrounded by strippers. I don't know if I can or should say anything or just let it go. I guess my biggest worry is that he's going to cheat. He has given me NO indication he's the type but I just have this weird gut feeling. Thoughts?
Was a junior in high school. The game was tied 1-1 with around 1 minute left. The other team had a corner and kicked it near post. I went out for the ball, but one of the players on the other team ran up and kicked me in the chest. The ref (apparently) didn't see, i fell into the goal, and the opposing forward had a wide open header into a wide open net to put his team up 2-1 with practically no time on the clock. I ran up to the ref screaming at him for a foul, pulled up my jersey to show him the cleat marks, the ref just said he didn't see it. I kept screaming at him, he gave me a red card, and I missed the next two games. We didn't have any other goalies, and the JV one got hurt the day before, so coach had to pull up the freshmen goalie. Turns out that my team needed to win one of the last two games to make tournament, but because a bad freshmen goalie was in net, we lost both of those games and didn't make tournament. I have never even said a word to the ref during a game since then.
Each time I think I'm making progress by being more emotionally stable, it seems like I may actually be disassociating or ignoring my own emotions at times, and even invalidating them. It's frustrating, and confusing.   It seems like since our thoughts can be wrong and skewed, you don't want to give them credence; you need to question them, but you also don't want to invalidate and be mean to yourself over it either.   Today, for example, I had a dream that my SO and I were growing apart, as we've both been very busy lately. Rather than addressing that, for some reason I once again brought up with him that I felt we don't have enough sex. It has been a week since we did, and I was feeling vulnerable. But after 12 years together a week does not mean anything necessarily, and he's not going anywhere. We can always talk about it with each other too. He's not going to just leave with no explanation.   It dawned on me that it's not the lack of sex that concerns me, but the way it might be an indication that he's growing distant physically and emotionally, and I become afraid. The answer was for him to hug me and tell me he cares and loves me.   It seems like if I'm not constantly making an effort to monitor my internal dialogue, validate myself, meditate and dive deeper into what's truly scaring me, then I enter this state of feeling disconnected and numb to people around me, as well as myself. I close them off because of fear. I don't know what I truly want or need, or how to open up to others. It gets so tiring, and none of us has time to dedicate our brainpower to fighting this all the time.   I don't want to keep pushing people away because I'm afraid of them, but I don't want to be all alone. And the way things are going lately, I'm isolating because I just don't feel as much pleasure from socializing since there is the underlying fear that who I am is inherently unlovable, and it's easier to be alone. Intellectually I know it's just not true, but I've thought this about myself since a very young age and it won't change overnight. It also confuses people; being open and friendly one day then not communicating for days or weeks when you're convinced that they think you're annoying or weird. They don't think that, but it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.
When I was little (around 5th grade) we lived way out in the country and our driveway was about 200 yards long.   We had this Rottweiler named Max, he used to walk down the driveway with me every morning (the bus ride was over an hour long so in the winter it was still dark outside when I walked down there) and wait on the bus with me.  He would then just turn around and walk back home.  Every day when the bus would drop me back off, he would be there waiting on me to walk with me back to the house.  I LOVED that dog.
This season so far has been about Walt trying to become Gus.  All the while, Jesse is starting to shine.  He became the hero last season saving Gus and Mike.  This season he's come up with the magnet plan and the train heist.  Now I'm starting to think that Jesse is actually gonna be the next Gus and Walt is gonna share the same fate as Max.  I think when they flash back to some background on Gus it will reveal he had more in common with Jesse than Walt.  Maybe that is what Gus saw in him.
Tell me more about this.   I tend to judge people by their credit scores. You seem to think I shouldn't. You get a low credit score by breaking promises, or making promises you can't keep. Which of those people should I like?   Or are the companies you made a deal with evil faceless corporations and you shouldn't be held accountable for lying to them, or ripping them off?   You know interest rates are high because they have to cover for the money they lose when shitbags decide they just aren't going to pay for the shit they buy.
I agree that Joel looks over fifties, but we should take in account that his life was way harder than most people you'd know nowadays. My dad had been a farmer for his whole life, he's mid forties now and doesn't look that different from Joel, really. Plus, if you look at our world, even if a few years back, having a kid between the ages of 16 and 20 is not really that rare XD
Just happened to be passing! It's a great topic and something that there are so many ways to talk about. A good one to bring up. So:     The "you" I'm referring to in the first example isn't the "little you", the one we infer from thoughts and bodily sensation, but rather the true self: the conscious environment. I guess I'm assuming in that phrasing that people already recognise themselves as the "open aware space" in which experiences arise; that they  are  the dream.     But then in the second example, when I make the dream-space reference more explicitly and say there is no "you", I mean "you" as in the "little you"!       The way I'd written the comment appears that they are different views, but really they are the same view. A good example of why we have to be careful of language here, I suppose! :-)   Actually, in the "filtering of infinite potential" metaphor, that you are experiencing "your own mind" doesn't necessarily imply there is no valuable information to be had from the environment. Because we have the perspective of a "little you" who receives information by sensory arisings, the way we learn about ourselves-as-the-world is through experience.   So listening to people, paying attention to events, tells us who we are at the moment. For instance, seeing lots of news articles about people having appendicitis may be the first sign that you should get checked out at the doctor. It's not just all about seeing owls because you've been thinking about owls, or redirecting events by reconstructing your forward imagery.   Meanwhile, changing ourselves and changing the world are equivalent, and we can only recognise our success in that when our sensory experience shifts accordingly. Again, active and interactive listening.     Experiences are all about your current state,  because the facts-of-the-world are your current state.     Taking the "two aspects" version of Transcendental Idealism, you would be the noumena (as I call it: the  facts-of-the-world  dissolved into the background of awareness) as much as you were the phenomenal (those aspects of the noumena that had unfolded as spatially-extended sensory experience: an experiential moment). Both are in and of awareness; awareness is what you "really are". In fact, the noumena is always as present as the phenomena, it's just that it is dissolve into the background  felt-sense .     You == world == state of you == state of the world.     To explore the apparent sensory world is to explore the current formatting of your own mind, and I'd go further and say that the overall formatting is just as present now as the particular element you are experiencing as an expanded environment. Behind that is just infinite potential.
After watching all 5 parts of the live audience demo, I can safely say it didn't do the game any favors. All in all it looks like every other console action RPG.   Customization seemed extremely limited. Two races with two variants. I expected as much considering their focus on combat, because the more races and the wilder they are, the more animation they need to make and the more complex that animation can become. I suspect limitations of their target hardware and the amount of equipment/gear they would need to make falls into that as well. Customization options are also limited, and seem typical of what you would find in a console action rpg.   Graphically it did look good. Environments seemed detailed and while stylistically it was a bit generic, it wasn't bad. It will be hard to say if those areas have repetitive design though without seeing them at large. They made a big deal about a bunch of things that are pretty typical in RPGs which raised an eyebrow. The "open world" statement seems disingenuous. Its "open" in the sense that its not purely one critical path. However, from what I could see it just means they have optional side paths you can run around in. I hate to keep referencing it, but it honestly feels about as "open world" as Fable. Fewer loading screens perhaps, but still you're basically just picking this forest path going to the left, or this slightly more overgrown one to the right. You can't just go charging through the forest.   The premise of the story also sounds interesting, however, how it's executed is the issue, and it may end up as nothing more than a thin framework for gear grinding. The silent protagonist aspect doesn't bode well in that respect.   Button mashing quick time events in combat...I've seen this somewhere before...and I wasn't a fan then.   All in all, it really didn't impress. Diablo style gear systems with a fable combat system. If they're looking for a typical action RPG as a console killer for Fable or something, they have it. It's wholeheartedly a console game from what I've seen. Ultimately though, it's still very light on the "RPG" and I actually left the experience LESS interested in the game then when I only had vague details on it. Hearing them insist that it was not just an action RPG but in fact a DEEP RPG was almost a slap in the face. I might have at least given them a "oh well they have to have some sort of marketing hook" pass if they were just going for the whole RPG with action combat thing, but it is by no means deep, and exaggerations like that make you just question everything else about their perception of things.   Like I said, it's going to be a decent game from the looks of it. It looks polished, it looks like there's gameplay there and it looks fun. But it's not revolutionary in the slightest, and appears to fall very squarely in the Fable/Too Human/ etc section of the action rpg genre, with a console platform focus.
Hey everyone!   I've had my desktop for about 6 years or so. Yesterday I forgot to shut the window while I was sleeping and I had a large rainstorm which caused water to splash near my computer while it was on sleep mode.   I let it dry out completely and unplugged the power as soon as i figured it out but when I tried to turn it on, the computer does not boot and the fans are blasting at full speed. It does not stop until I completely turn off the PSU.   I've tried draining the power completely and removing the internal battery and it did not seem to help.   Afterwards I removed the GPU (Radeon 5770) and the computer seemed to boot normally. The fans we're spinning at their normal speeds. When I plug the GPU back into the system, the problem returns and the fans go on full blast.   By unplugging the ram, no changes were noticed leading me to believe the ram is fine.   Without a GPU it's hard for me to reliably check if the system is booting properly to the best of my knowledge.   Any advice on what to do next? I only have a hopeful guess that I should just replace the GPU instead of the Mobo as I do not know the true extent of the damage.   Money is very tight for me right now so I don't want to spend money on a GPU and find out a few days later that in reality the Mobo is the cause.   Thank you for taking the time out to read and have a great day!
I am writing this as someone who has worked in software development for over a decade so all proposed tweaks will utilize existing game mechanics ideally this will make the changes more appealing to Massive. If you like the proposals please upvote and tag u/HamishBode. Also, please give your feedback and ideas as well. There are a lot of fantastic ideas out there.   The Division are agents working for the same team - though some from the First Wave went rogue - so it has never felt inline with the story that we were all running around trying to get equipment for ourselves. The purpose of these tweaks is to create a unified objective that encourages team work, furthers the story while also creating logical and balanced PVP situations for all agents all while maintaining the PvPvE universe Massive originally intended.   ENTERING THE NEW DZ   The gear score system has always been badly flawed and easily exploited, however the difficulty system provides a predictable way to build your experience to your taste. As a result much like when doing a mission you will now select a difficulty. That difficulty will determine the quality of gear you are able to receive or purchase in the DZ as well how much reward you receive. The scale below roughly outline the proposal. Note on the scale, I do not propose the amount of currency or XP a player will get for DZ activities only attach a scale where the Heroic level will receive full rewards (100%), everything else is scaled off of that:   Normal difficulty -  Min score of gear dropped: 163  Max score of gear dropped: 181  XP and currency on kill: 40%  Phoenix credits received upon successful extraction: 4  DZ currency upon successful extraction: 1,000   Hard difficulty -  Min score of gear dropped: 204 Max score of gear dropped: 214  XP and currency on kill: 60%  Phoenix credits received upon successful extraction: 5  DZ currency upon successful extraction: 2,000   Challenging difficulty -  Min score of gear dropped: 214  Max score of gear dropped: 240  XP and currency on kill: 80%  Phoenix credits received upon successful extraction: 6  DZ currency upon successful extraction: 4,000   Heroic difficulty -  Min score of gear dropped: 229 or 268  Max score of gear dropped: 229 or 268  XP and currency on kill: 100%  Phoenix credits received upon successful extraction: 10  DZ currency upon successful extraction: 6,000   These equipment brackets will also represent what is available at DZ vendors. Rank walls to purchase will be removed but if you want to buy max level equipment you have to go in on Heroic.   Matchmaking   Matchmaking will now be a much more critical part of the DZ experience as human players will be split into two teams - First Wave and Second Wave Agents. Both sides have the same objective but different reasons for wanting to achieve them. You and your group, if you are grouped, will be placed in a server based on balancing - for example if there is a server with 6 First Wave Agents and 2 Second Wave Agents you and your team will be placed with the Second Wave to balance out teams (I'd also like to point out this is a way to be sure solo players are protected by a group as well). Placing the agents on teams like this gives you instant allies when you enter the DZ, as teammates will not be able to kill each other, but it also gives you instant adversaries. This should reduce issues with being ganked or having the entire server jump on you as half the server will be on your side regardless. Once placed the story begins:   DZ Story   First Wave Agents - Narration: Aaron Keener   "Agents, fate has smiled on us today. When the JTF lost containment of the quarantine zone they did not have time to evacuate all the equipment the military was staging in the area to try and stabilize the city. If we can get our hands on that gear the balance of power shifts greatly in our favor. The trouble is this, everyone knows it's in there somewhere - Rikers, LMB...and Second Wave Agents - everyone wants it, but we're going to get it first. JTF troops hid the equipment somewhere in the quarantine zone, we don't know where but there are still JTF agents stuck in the quarantine zone and they should be able to give us an idea where to find it. Luckily they don't know who we are, as far as they're concerned we are the rescue party. Lead them out of there and get whatever info you can about the location of the stockpiles. Once you get the stockpiles signal us and we'll get them airlifted out."   Second Wave Agents - Narration: Faye Lau   "Agent. We have a serious emergency. When the quarantine zone got overrun and went dark there was an enormous amount of top end military gear left behind. It is imperative that we secure that equipment before anyone else does. If it ends up in the wrong hands we risk losing the city. From what we know everyone is in there looking for it, unfortunately even rogue First Wave agents led by Keener. To help you out we have called in all Second Wave Agents so you should have additional support in the Dark Zone. Before everything behind the wall went to hell JTF soldiers did their best to hide the supply stockpiles, we don't know an exact location. You best intel source is going to be JTF agents who are still trapped in the Dark Zone, find them, lead them to safety, and they should be able to give you an idea where to look. Once you secure the stockpiles signal us and we will send in a chopper for extraction. Good luck agent."   LIFE IN THE DZ   The two biggest changes straight away are all NPCs are set at the same difficulty based on the difficulty level, and you are on a voice channel with everyone from your allegiance (First Wave, Second Wave). Additionally since NPCs, like agents, are looking for supply stockpiles there is no telling what groups you will see roaming and where. This will lead to far more NPC skirmishes. Named NPCs, chest, etc will exists as they do currently as will their drops and your loading them into your stash however to get the biggest rewards you need to find the stockpiles which will be hidden at random locations. Your best chance of finding these stockpiles, unless you just want to wander aimlessly, is to find trapped JTF agents and get intel from them.   Rescuing JTF Agents   Not shockingly JTF agents are completely overwhelmed and trapped behind enemy lines. You will find them in groups of 3 at random locations throughout the DZ (DZ levels are no longer significant). They will beg you to lead them to an exit and if you do so they will tell you what they know about where the stockpiles were hidden. As you get JTF agents to safety a circle will appear on you and your allegiance map showing an approximate location of a stockpile, the more JTF you lead out the smaller the circle will be (giving you a better idea where to look), keeping the JTF agents alive becomes important for intel. Only the rescuing allegiance will be able to see the intel...as an opposing agent this doesn't mean you couldn't follow your enemies from a distance to see where they are going. You are secret agents after all.   Finding The Stockpiles   The unique thing about the stockpiles, aside from everybody is looking for them, is that when one is extracted everyone in your allegiance receives the reward (much like a group receives a supply drop). As a result it is important to everyone in your allegiance that the stockpile be located and extracted safely. Items from the stockpile will not take up places in your personal DZ capacity. When you call in an extraction, much as happens currently, everyone will know. NPCs and enemy agents in the area may make a play for your items so you and your allegiance will need to set up a careful defense. Once the items are extracted all agents in the allegiance will receive 4 sealed caches, Phoenix credits, DZ credits, Division tech and XP. These stockpiles need to be very worth your while.   Regular Extractions   I feel like this game functions best when co-op is encouraged so allegiances will get points for all successful extractions as was outlined in the difficulty settings section. Again, it is worth your time to be sure people in your allegiance have a successful extraction. This again protects small groups, solo players, etc from being ganked.   Espionage   I really like the idea of double agents. First Wave or Second Wave agents will look the same, you cannot look and tell who is friend or foe. However, everyone in your allegiance is on the same voice channel so is that radio silent player who is following you on your side and just not mic'd or is he a spy trying to blend into your group to find out what you know while feeding info back to his allegiance? This is also implemented to try and encourage communication and strategy within teams.   Espionage and the New Rogue System   You can only commit espionage if no one knows what allegiance you are with, once you open fire on an opposing agent you will be marked with a rogue symbol (only people in the opposing allegiance will see this symbol) identifying you to all opposing agents and marking your location on the map for 60 seconds. It is entirely possible that a crafty agent could run with the opposition until a stockpile was located at which point they could call in their team and blow their cover. I feel like that would add a ton to the game.   That is it in a nutshell   I know this is lengthy, my longest post ever, but I abridged it as best I can. If you like these ideas help me get them in front of u/HamishBode and company by getting this to the top of the sub. Let me know your thoughts and thank you for reading.   Oh yeah. Since rank will no longer matter no XP loss on death.

Just wanted to get this out first, this does not involve cheating. Ok, here goes.   My gf and I have dated for 4 years throughout high school. I know they all say it, but we are very mature teenagers. We are both seniors, and won't be dating in college, mostly because we realize we will only end up hurting each other and we want to grow and become adults, without draining time trying to maintain an adolescent relationship. We have discussed meeting up after college to see if we are still compatible. The following is what I told her today:   During my junior year, the third year of our relationship, I became suicidal, for a multiple of reasons. I made plans to kill myself once that March of 2014, but didn't go through with it, and I attempted to kill myself in July 2014 as well. Obviously, wasn't successful. Later, a friend of my sisters came over for a sleepover. I was in shock, as I had sort of suddenly realized what the fuck I just tried to do, and she has always been flirty with me, and soon enough she was leaning in for a kiss. I had let it go too far. I almost did, but stopped and told her I wanted to keep dating my gf. Said girl got very mad and vowed to get back at me for "leading her on" (I did nothing of the sort).   That basically is what I told her. She searched my eyes, muttered "I've been so stupid" and abruptly got up and left. I told her I didn't do anything, which I didn't, and that I loved her. I told her I had waited this long because I was afraid people of what people would say when they learned I was suicidal, and that I didn't tell her about the rejection of another girls kiss because I was afraid of what she would say. I know I shouldn't have waited; that was mistake number 1. Thing is, I want to fix this, because I want to be with her as long as we have left until we part ways in college.   I'd appreciate it if you could weigh in on this, specifically how to fix it.  PS: I am no longer suicidal.
Throwaway here, I dated a girl for a long time (4+ years) and she is by no means ugly but was overweight.  On a scale i guess I would say im maybe a 7, and she was prob a 3-4 depending on how much u like big girls lmfao (prob like 80 pounds-ish overweight).   Anyways, I loved her to death, and was not even remotely distracted by it, despite the fact that she was obviously not "hot".  I found her absurdly attractive.  Mainly because of her personality but I became extremely fond of her quirks and that made me completely overlook what many of my friends couldn't.
Here is a link about Chainbeat decks   [Black Garden]( causes all summoned monsters to halve their ATK, but if you summon [Rabbit]( you can chain the Black Garden's effect using their abilities to banish themselves. Thunderbird's effect can be used as it says when something is activated, but does Rabbit's still work? Is it a [Quick-Effect]( that could trigger if a card targets it? The strategy of Black Garden + Rabbit/Thunderbird is to chain the latter cards when Black Garden triggers from their summoning. You banish the card, and the Black Garden effect of losing half ATK doesn't resolve since the monsters were banished. This makes sense on how [Chains]( are resolved, but can understandably be seen as OP or glitched.   I've also heard you can't play it during the Battle Phase. A lot of the info online is from a few years ago, I've searched 'Black Garden' on this subreddit and yugioh101 too, and am getting a similar story back me up, but apparently new rules came out this year.
Well we are still artists, anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot. Its just that what we do isn't always art. In design there is a utilitarian aspect to what we do. Its for something, art is not. Art is only for sake of being itself, not for any other purpose like design is. Art is subjective and design is objective. Can a graphic poster for like a music show be looked at as art? Of course, but in doing so you take away the utilitarian aspect of it. It's the specific work of design that is not art. But we are still artists nontheless.
This is a very complicated situation so i'll try my best to make it clear.   I dated this girl my freshman year of high school, let's call her "Jessica". We broke up after a month and I didn't think much of it, but we didn't speak for three years after the breakup (she says that it was me ignoring her, but it was mutual). She began dating another guy, "Liam", after our breakup and dated him for the three years after, but broke up with him when he left for college, as he was a year ahead of us. During the time when she was dating Liam she became best friends with "Paul" (who is in love with her), and cheated on Liam with another guy "Tom". She also hooked up with Paul once after her and Liam's breakup, but kept, and continues to, string Paul along in the name of their friendship. I guess that's a concise summary of her exploits.   Fast forward to our senior year, she began to message me out of the blue and I occasionally responded. One night we got into an actual invested conversation on the topic of her having a crush on someone. At this time I knew that she had gone on two dates and kissed one of my best friends, "Brock", because he told me about it, but she thought that no one knew about their situation. I thought Brock was the guy that she had a crush on, but she denied it, and that piqued my interest. I pressed and she eventually revealed that she had a crush on me, and had been infatuated with me for the three years which we ignored each other. She convinced me to go out on a date with her and we began to text.   Our conversations were gradually turning R rated, and when we went on our first date there was definite sexual tension in the air. She said that she would have sex with me once we became official, and only then. Of course, me being a teenage male, thought with my penis instead of my brain and asked her out on a second date. We went on multiple dates and I eventually asked her to be my official girlfriend, but she refused on the basis of needing time. We went on a few more dates after, but I found out that while we were dating, she had gone out on a date with Brock again. When I confronted her, she told me that she was had gone out with her mother that day, but evidently Brock tagged along, and that she did not lie to me because she told me that her mother was with her and that Brock's presence was irrelevant so he did not have to be mentioned. At this point I had slight feelings for her so I moved past it and we continued casually dating.   The next incident happened a few weeks later when she suddenly stopped responding to my texts for three days (I sent her one text each day). I also sent her one snapchat which she opened but did not reply to. I was upset, and I forgot about her as girlfriend material. After the third day she texted me at midnight with a casual "hey". I was confused and she maintained that she did nothing wrong until I pressed enough to get her to admit that Liam, who had a current girlfriend, had come back in town from college and she had been hanging out with him and that she had sex with him while he was in town, even though she told me that she only had sex with guys that she had an emotional connection with (we had yet to have sex, as she had denied me every time I made an advance). She also admitted that she had blocked my phone number and that she "forgot" to reply to my snapchat during those three days. She said that she was sorry and that she regretted it and that she wanted to continue dating. I was livid and humiliated at being the second choice, but I agreed because there were only a few weeks of high school left and I had nothing to lose.   We continued going on dates, but recently she has began acting cold towards me. She has become increasingly hard to talk to, she frequently replies to me with one word answers, and she has began rescheduling our dates for reasons which I am sure she lies about. I feel like she wants me to ask her to become my official girlfriend, but I know that I will never want that kind of commitment to her after what she has done to me, and based on her past history of cheating. But I have also invested so much of my time and money into Jessica, and I don't want it all to go to waste. Am I in the wrong for continuing down this path Jessica is leading me on? Am I wrong for not forgiving her? I need advice on this whole situation.   P.S. Throughout this whole time period she has continued to spend inordinate amounts of time with Paul, and goes on dates with him, which she insists are not actual dates.
I don't think SE will ever do this because gil sellers/botters make them money in the long run.   Conspiracy theory alert!   SE wants us to get small amounts of gilspam.  If they wanted to shut it down, they could.  I've worked on services for 10 years and everything is closely monitored.  SE knows how much money the gil spammers are making, they know about the big transactions where someone comes in and gives you 10 mil for no reason.   The fact is, every single gil spammer had to pay for a copy of the game and a sub so they could gil spam.  SE has takes action every month or two but it is strictly for display.  But they want people to continue buying the game, and paying for a month sub; its their way of taxing the gil seller.  SE gets their cut.   The thing is, if SE made it impossible to gil spam, or instabanned (or instamute) every gil spammer the second they sent a message (which they could do), they'd have  to explain to their accounting team why sales went down by N% that month.   SE very precisely times banning of botters/gilspammers so that it is mutually profitable for the botter/seller/SE.   We deal with gil sellers because we like the game.  SE deals w/ gil sellers because at the end of the day their job is to make money.
Hi oklahoma... /r/okc is probably a more appropriate subreddit but there isn't much activity there...   In a year I'm graduating from college in Austin and got a nice offer to work for a pretty large company in OKC. I really want to take it but since I've never lived outside Houston I don't know if I'll be okay in oklahoma. I figure I could take classes and work for an MBA at OSU/OU for a few years, but what else can I do?   Also, is the OKC job market decent for economics majors? Are there actual analyst or banking positions open or is that degree sort of doomed as a barista in OKC?   I read a bunch of the other threads, but when [this list]( tells me the #1 thing to do in oklahoma is a highway, I'm not exactly excited to make the move.
from the point of view of the employee it should be lower, or the employee is loosing money if he delivers more value than he gets in salary.
Had a teacher who would brag about getting me in trouble to other teachers, right in front of my face. No other kids, just me. Whenever someone was doing something wrong, I'd usually try to encourage them to stop. (In a nice way, not a asshole way.) She would get me in trouble on the grounds that I was participating by talking to them. She'd make fun of my hand writing and give me back assignments for being too good whenever I'd try to go above and beyond to impress her, and you know, maybe get her to like me more.   She was a terrible person irl though. She had two daughters and openly hated one of them. Causing the hated daughter to become an alcoholic, drug addict, and physically and emotionally self-abusive.   The daughter she loved was friends with my older sister and would invite my sister to sleep over. Her mom would encourage my sister to do things my parents forbid (Like walk to the movies at 10:00pm when she was 11 years old and sneak into an R-rated movie.) and then told my sister she would lie to my parents for her whenever she wanted.   This teacher died of cancer in 2002. I cried at her funeral ONLY because the daughter she hated wrote a poem with the line "I've always loved you and I know you loved me. Even if you didn't that wouldn't change a thing."
I'll be 25 this year.  I currently work as an au pair in Paris, France. I love my job, but it's time to return to the United States.  I am searching for a job in Los Angeles, but because I don't have loads of funds, I am searching for live-in employment, or a well-paid occupation that will allow me to crash on the couches of friends for a limited amount of time before I can get my own apartment. I plan to start this job when my current contract ends, which means August/September.   Right now I am searching for au pair, nanny and personal assistant jobs.  Obviously personal assistant is my first choice, since those positions can be extremely well-paid and that is the sort of work that I genuinely enjoy doing.  I know that I could be a fantastic personal assistant, I am enthusiastic about helping people, I have fantastic computer and note-taking skills, I can type around 105 WPM, I love to cook and clean, etc.  I'm personable, friendly and professional.  I have a really studious personality and I actually get excited when someone gives me a subject to research.  My friends and family always turn to me when they want information on a subject, fast.  I excel in areas of organization and scheduling.  I know I am an excellent employee and my professional references can vouch for that, every employer I've ever had has told me what a valuable employee I am.   My problem is that I have no real  experience  in this field.  That is to say, I've never held the actual title of a personal assistant, even though I've done this sort of work for previous employers. Basically, my resumé looks crummy, and I have no idea how to make it appealing to prospective employers.  I just don't look good on paper, but get me in an interview and I can prove myself.  Unfortunately I'm in Paris and I am unavailable for interviews in-person.  Ouch. I've tried to research tips on making P.A. resumes sur the Internet, but all the example resumes are people with loads of experience.   My other problem is that I can't seem to find a good website for seeking personal assistant jobs.  For au pair work, there are sites like  but for personal assistant, it seems like the only choice is Monster.com or an agency.  I tried to contact an agency in Los Angeles called The Help Company.  They never responded.   So basically, I'm just looking for any sort of help that anyone can offer.  Hints and tips.  Websites.  Resume assistance.  Know-how.  Websites with great resume and cover letter assistance.   I need to know how to sell myself from 6,000 miles away.  I think employers see my location and toss my resume into the trash.  I need to secure a job in Los Angeles and I've got 3 months to do it.   This is my (modified) resume: [page 1]( [page 2](  I obviously changed things, such as my name, address, etc. so that I could post it here but remain anonymous.   I have had other jobs but they aren't relevant to this position so they just took up space on my resume.  I've worked in retail, food service and I've also worked in set and costume construction/design for my University.
Are you cooking any sides?  How much sides are you offering for your get together?   It depends on the folk of course and the particulars of diets in your area, 1 lb of meat per person is a good serving, though it might feel low with not a lot of sides, or if folks around you are big eaters.  Pork butt still seems cheap all around and I think is the prefered substrate for most BBQs?
Until It Sleeps Corporation expects an EBIT of $14,000 every year forever. Until It Sleeps currently has no debt, and its cost of equity is 16 percent. The firm can borrow at 9 percent. If the corporate tax rate is 35 percent, what is the value of the firm? What will the value be if the company converts to 50 percent debt? To 100 percent debt?   Attempt   a) Vu = EBIT(1-Tc)/ ru = 14,000(0.65)/0.16 = $56,875 Is it correct to assume that all equity financed firm that the re=ru=WACC?   In addition, I am not sure how to solve with 50% of debt My attempt   Vl = Vu + tcD (D is equal to 1/2Vl) Vl = Vu + 0.35(.5vl) vl = 56,875 + .175vl 0.825vl = 56,875  vl = $68,939.39 (However I am making a mistaking and am not sure why the Debt is equal to 0.5vu instead of 0.5vl)?   Thank you for the help
Alright, I've been trying to stay off the EA/Maxis/SimCity hatewagon, because I was honestly starting to get a bit tired of hearing about it.  I haven't bought the game, so I have no dog in this fight.   But as an aspiring game designer, this paragraph fucking pisses me off:   >So, could we have built a subset offline mode?  Yes.  But we rejected that idea because it didn’t fit with our vision.  We did not focus on the “single city in isolation” that we have delivered in past SimCities.  We recognize that there are fans – people who love the original SimCity – who want that.  But we’re also hearing from thousands of people who are playing across regions, trading, communicating and loving the Always-Connected functionality.   The SimCity we delivered captures the magic of its heritage but catches up with ever-improving technology.   Particularly the part where she says, essentially, "We know there are people who really want this.  But there are also people who don't really care, so clearly there's no merit to what that first group is saying!"   No.  Fuck you.  You want to take ownership for the decision not to include an offline mode?  Fine.  That's on you.  Hell, I'll even support the decision if you truly felt like it would have detracted from your "vision" (despite the fact that it was never a question of "one or the other").  But the fact of the matter is that you made the wrong decision.  Bottom line.  You thought, "We can make this game have an online requirement and it won't detract from the player's entertainment."  You were wrong.  The servers took a shit on themselves, you had to remove features to even allow people to play, and you still haven't completely solved the problem.  Even when the game works, people have told you that your social offerings are too shallow to necessitate the online requirement.  Your fans, the people who gave you the benefit of the doubt and bought your game despite their reservations, have told you that you were wrong.   What's really amazing to me is that this article is clearly aimed at the people complaining about the online requirement, not the people who were fine with it.  Does she really think she's convincing people with this?    None of the features she listed would need to be nixed for them to patch in a separate offline mode.  In fact, it would actually be pretty awesome to retain the region-based gameplay, where all the trading happens between cities that  you  have built.  Need more energy for your casino city?  Build a refinery city.  You'd actually need to start filling those needs yourself instead of just plopping down next to someone who can already offer those goods.  You'd start managing multiple cities on a macro level in addition to the micro.  That would be cool.  I would enjoy that.  You would hardly need to change any of the core mechanics, and it would even partially alleviate a lot of the complaints about cities feeling too small.   But you're not going to do that.  You are convinced that you are right and thousands of consumers are wrong.  No, not  all  of your consumers, but that doesn't fucking matter.  The fact that your game cannot be mentioned on one of the largest social news aggregators in the world without nearly every comment harping on this is a testament to how flawed your thinking is.  All you would have had to say is, "Yes, we could have included an offline mode, but we chose not to because it didn't fit our vision for the game.  We now recognize that this was a mistake, and we're now working on figuring out how to patch an offline mode into the game."  Do you have any idea how much that would have set our minds at ease?  No promises, no dates, no details necessary.  Just telling us that you have heard our complaints, you know what we want, and you're working on making it happen would have been enough for most.  Look at all of the most beloved game developers in the industry.  Now recognize that THIS IS WHY WE LOVE THEM.  They put value on what the community has to say about their games, because they don't want anyone to feel like they didn't get their money's worth.  You think that doing a bug fix for the pathfinding is implementing community feedback?  Fuck you.  The community is not here to help you find bugs.  That's what your QA team is for.  The community is here to tell you how to make your game better.  In this case, the community has been telling you how to not make your game a complete rip off.   This article is worse than ignoring the community.  It tells the community, "Yeah, we heard you, but your idea is stupid and would ruin the game" without actually giving any reasons why.  Fuck this bullshit, Lucy.  Have some fucking integrity.  /rant
I wouldn't say diesel is dumb as long as you don't absent mindlessly add gasoline in the car, but to put it bluntly, a new car as your first is, in my opinion.   If you plan to keep the car for a long time, I'd recommend getting two years old TDi because of the price drop after the first owner. Don't get MKV, go for early MK6 ('10,'11). Or if you want a new boddy style, the MK7 is coming in the summer.
I've done rotations from a leashless camp, one buff-next buff and still been able to gank at 3 (without backing) at over 1/2 hp, sometimes close to 3/4 as Pantheon, Lee and Xin. I don't play Sej, and you just can't on Wu, even in old jungle he got really low on his first clear. The new jungle just requires more concentration as if you waste time ganking you fall really far behind on exp, if you get counter jungled you fall behind, and if you have no impact your lanes will be more susceptible to ganks. Also, Vi's first clear is a lot worse than Lee's/Pantheons, and Jarvans is allright, but not great either, probably on par with Lee's
Hey there, people of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex!   My wife and I currently live and own a house in the suburbs of Denver, CO. We're both 37 and don't currently have any kids (we're debating having one in the next year or two).   Basically, we're thinking about looking for a new adventure. My wife is a lifelong native of Colorado and I've lived here nearly 20 years. We've basically done everything in Colorado multiple times.   We've been looking around in other metro areas, looking at the software job market, availability of greenery (Denver's a lot of brown.. high desert and all), housing prices, cost of living, locations to adventure, etc. We looked very seriously at the Pacific Northwest (Portland and Seattle) but struck it down a month or so ago as the housing prices just weren't worth it for what you got.   Today, my wife randomly suggested we look at Texas. Neither of us have ever been, and Texas has a bit of a negative stigma here (a lot of Texans and Californians move to Colorado, and natives don't like that very much). We quickly realized that DFW was our best bet and that the DFW metroplex appears to have a booming software industry, even moreso than Denver.   A bit about us, and then some results from our research and some follow-up questions:   Me:  Software engineer. Consultant. 17 years of experience. Currently make about $175K a year on straight contracts corp-to-corp.   Her:  Doctorate in Russian Literature from Columbia University. Amazing cook. Stays home and embroiders things.   We'd be looking to sell our house in Colorado and move to the DFW area late next summer (2017) after my current contract is up. We'd come with about $150K in cash, rent for a few months, pick up some sort of job/contract, and buy a house based on our location research and housing prices.   First off, location. In our research, it appears most of the tech jobs are in the Plano, Richardson, Addison triangle area, as well as a formidable selection in Irving (as well as downtown, obviously). Is this correct? That Plano, Richardson, Addison area seems very interesting.   Secondly, the house prices are insanely inexpensive versus what we're used to. Not only that, the houses are gorgeous. Here in Colorado, as well as in the Pacific NW where we looked heavily, most of the houses are copy/paste, tiny lots and very plain. It looks like houses in the Plano and surrounding area fall into three categories:     $250K-$275K - 2800ish sq feet, semi-plain, but good spaces for the price.   $325K-$360K - 3500+ sq feet, a bit nicer, great outsides, good space.   $400K-$430K - 3500+ sq feet, immaculately beautiful with a ton of personality, large lots.     There seems to be no reason to go higher than $430K. In the Denver metro, $430K is a plain 2200 sq foot starter home in a nice area.   Granted, property taxes are a lot higher (my research puts the average at around 2.5%), but with no state income tax (currently 4.69% in Colorado) and lower consumption tax, that ends up being a wash, if not slightly in our favor. Utility costs are a bit higher, but the cost of living other than that is lower, so I figure that evens out.   Also, I never knew Texas was so green. The pictures are beautiful. It looks like things grow. The lots are huge.   Economically, it looks good. Even if I had to take a small hit in income, the cost of living in DFW overall is amazing.   One thing we don't know is cultural. Neither of us have ever been to Texas. We're both semi-liberal (left-leaning is probably the most accurate description), but we can keep to ourselves if that's a problem. Thought it appears from voting maps that DFW is actually more blue than red. Also, we have a read that Texans, in general, are very friendly and hospitable.   Basically, the area just seems to good to be true. It looks beautiful, the people appear to be friendly, the houses there are beautiful with a ton of personality (and pools! so many pools!) and reasonably priced. The job market looks great (did an indeed search for Senior .NET Software Engineer within 30 miles of Plano and it was double the openings versus Denver).   I didn't even mention that there appears to be gigabit internet all over the place in the DFW area! I've been stuck on 50/10 Comcast Business for years.   We both feel after 6 hours of research today that we have to be missing something. (As we live in Colorado, we're used to the tricks people play about "Don't come here! It's awful! Coyotes will nibble your feet off!")   Thanks in advance for any help/advice you can give us.
I'm not sure. I actually don't have a solid opinion on that issue. If anything I probably would say that direct democracy makes the issue worse.   Why? Because the power doesn't disappear, it simply shifts. You cannot imagine how powerful the media is in shaping not just public opinion, but most importantly shaping public awareness.   The ACTA campaign was nothing until enough people started pushing against it  that the media was forced to take it as an issue . Many publishers (i.e. also newspapers) were in favour of ACTA and they only started reporting about it when they couldn't ignore it anymore: Google, Reddit, and by far most importantly Wikipedia made a difference (for SOPA and that attention then moved over to ACTA) with their (semi-)blackouts.   In short: I don't think I can believe in direct democracy because if everyone has to have an opinion on everything then those who make opinions gain the power. It might work for a few big issues, those that already gained enough attention, but not for everything.   As long as the opinion-makers are private enterprises with business interests and agendas direct democracy can (imho) not work.
Basically it adds functionality to swing etc but at the same time doesn't define one way to do things so they can be done any number of ways. Compiling via Gradle also sucked because of it's weird compatibility with 7/8. Since it was a 7 feature and then actually guaranteed in 8 (something like that).
This is more of a satisfaction experience than fun for me, but here goes.   In World of Warcraft, defeating pre-nerf 25-man Heroic Ragnaros, with a US top 10 ranking to boot.   The heroic version of the encounter consisted of four phases, and in the early stages when the fight was still new and guilds were a little undergeared for it, the fight lasted about 15 minutes on average. After 480 grueling attempts over several weeks, my guild finally took him down and a huge wave of relief came over us all.   Pre-nerf, mechanically, it was one of the hardest encounters ever put into the game. The level of coordination required to defeating him was immense, and getting 25 people to do so was no easy task. One little mishap could easily cause the group to wipe and have to start over. Being that the fight was so long, and initially took us so many attempts, this was incredibly frustrating at times.   In particular, the "dance" phase as it was commonly known as, caused us a lot of grief just because it required very tight coordination and damage requirements, or half of the raid would get instagibbed by a myriad of mobs exploding on top of them. We wiped in this phase oh so many times.   Once we finally had a good grip on that phase, we started focusing on the final phase. Oh, how I loathe thee. This phase was no easier than the others. It was literally a ticking time bomb. Fire patches would constantly spawn in random areas and eventually fill up the room. There was a way to extinguish the flames and three people were assigned to doing this, but as the fight progressed, the fire would spawn faster and faster to a point where you could no longer effectively control it. You had to kill Ragnaros before the fire engulfed the room and killed your raid all while dealing with several other mechanics that required the raid to constantly be moving around the room collectively, dodging the fires, meteors, and standing in specific formations. Eventually, Ragnaros fell before us and the gratifying sounds of 25 nerds cheering in excitement and relief were heard over mumble. It was a time in my gaming days that I'll surely never forget.   After 480 attempts, some people may not see that as fun but the fact that we were able to maintain a mostly consistent group of 25 people to pull this off, was a feat in itself. I think we only had 2 major roster changes across all of those attempts and that was mostly because the fight favored classes with mobility and both high aoe and single target damage output (nerf mages).   If anyone is interested, here is my guild's video of the kill, with mumble commentary during the last few minutes:  Every now and then I get a bit nostalgic and go back and watch parts of it.
In the campaign that I'm running, the PCs have decided that they've wasted enough time and have failed to stop the disasters plaguing the various worlds, as a result, they are planning on traveling back in time, to give themselves enough time to save everyone once again. In the campaign, the method of time-travel they're using is one based on the split world idea, and the players are fully aware of this. This has caused the players to take many actions that they probably normally wouldn't take.   Specifically, in a previous session, the PCs came across an ancient runic array that had 5 functions:     Change Gravity - To avoid the various meteors and comets that are hitting the planet.     Create Disasters - A runic array that created massive disasters on the surface of the planet.     Summon Extraplanar Creatures - This array summons massive swarms of extraplanar creatures to kill life on the planet. (Requires 6 people)     Imbue Ability - The people who step in this circle can imbue another person in the circle with an ability point.     Divinity - The people in the circle can choose another person in the area to imbue Divine Rank 1 on them.       The only problem with this, which the PCs were aware of at the time, is that the "Imbue Ability" and "Divinity" circles required power before they could function, specifically power that resulted from the deaths of people on the planet, helped by the other three circles.   Not only did the PCs experiment some and gain power that was originally in the circle, they went so far to use the "Create Disasters" function multiple times until finally the runic array stopped gaining power, due to the lack of any more life on the planet below. Their reasoning was, the world's going to be destroyed in a week anyway, and we can go back in time and save it anyway...   What should I do about these events, and what alignment do these actions put the characters under? I'd think some flavor of evil, but the players believe they were acting for the "greater good".
Sorry for the massive amount of text.   So for the past couple of days I've been talking to a boy on Okcupid. He's very sweet and nice and we've been messaging nonstop for days. The other day he said he liked me and we planned a date, but the day before I had realized that I really love being single and I don’t want to just date someone I only kinda like so I decided to cancel all my OKc dates. However, there’s another guy who I ran into a from one of my clubs who I'm pretty into and it looks like we could possibly be a thing. So I decided to not be serious about any of my dates until I see where things went with him and that included the boy on OKc. However he was so nice and I didn’t want to hurt his feelings and in so many words I told him I enjoyed talking to him. Since then he's been calling me cute 24/7 telling me how much he likes me and bringing up the possibility of a relationship. At this point he thinks I'm really serious about him and through our conversation I bring up that I took a funny photo on my tumblr. He asks to see it so I went through and made sure to delete or at least mark private all the bad posts. I hop into the shower after sending him my url and then when I get out he replies that I looked cute and I made a bad joke to him about his standards being low and he replies that he's gonna go. I felt like I had just said something kinda mean and he must be pretty sensitive so I apologized profusely.   Then he says that the joke isn’t what he’s upset about. And at this point I'm upset so i'm just like I don't want to drag anything out of you but i want you to tell me if somethings wrong. He says that's its fine so he's just gonna stop talking. At this point I’m mad because I had apologized so many times why is he so sensitive. So I just say whatever and go to bed.   In between classes today I was thinking about this and if he could have seen anything bad on my tumblr because I deleted everything bad but I decide to check anyway and that’s when I saw it. I guess I never marked a post about him private. In it I said "boys suck. but there’s a cute boy(referring to him) that is so nice and sweet but I don't think that I like him but I don’t want to hurt him. BUT then there's this other cute boy(referring to the guy from my club) that is so passion driven and cute and intimidatingly smart and   i like him and want to see what happens with him so I just have to wait". And now I feel like shit because I’ve unintentionally rejected him and this is after he told me he has some trust issues and wants a girl who is loyal to him. But I wrote that days ago and I've actually been more open to being serious out this boy but i messed it up and so I tried saving face by sending him a message saying sorry I'm a piece of shit but so far there is no reply.

Not to stray too far from the topic of graphics issues but, again, i play the hero a lot so i have a strong opinion-   its undoubtable that the hero is very weak right now. The change of nighttime from 6min nights to 4 min nights was a  huge  nerf, and there's really been no buffs to counter it out.   Basically its like this- level 7 is his strongest point. It used to be this came right at minute 6.5 meaning right after night time, giving him a long night to gank with. Also, the first ward died right then meaning he can gank safely or even potentially catch out supports putting up the next ward.   Now, he has much shorter nights. This doesnt matter lategame when he has his ult, but his first night is 100% neutered. He sucks in lane for the first day always, but his first night used to get him back on track. Currently, you dont hit level 7 until 6.5 min when the night only has about a minute left- and the wards dont go down till 7 minutes. Ganking at level 5 is too early- the kills are much less likely, and dont give enough xp.   That is probably the most important part of this whole thing- if you roam immediately at 5, gank a sidelane, and get a double kill- you will come back to lane being level 6, and the enemy will be almost 7. Killing two level 3-4 heroes and splitting the xp 3 ways is NOT ENOUGH to merit leaving the lane. (and of course this is best case scenario- if you only get 1 kill its even worse, and heaven forbid the gank fail or ns dies, its basically gg right there. Which is not unreasonable because many people overestimate his lvl 5 strength, its not really that great)   His laning even during nighttime is not so good as to be worth getting wrecked for the first 4 minutes. His ganking puts you even farther behind in lane.   Second nighttime comes at 12-13 minutes (depending how many times you use darkness) and its much past his prime. This is when the enemy mid has his first big item and NS is quite honestly not that scary. For example, second night time means the enemy invoker has his double forge spirits and forcestaff. NS can no longer kill him in the 5 seconds of silence, and if he stays around, will just die to invoker.
I'm posting this on behalf of my fiance, since she has no internet access. She attends a small liberal arts college in New Hampshire. Someone (possibly not even a resident of her dorm) downloaded copyright material on their network, and now they are shutting down internet access to her dorm from today until Sunday as a punishment because no one came forward and confessed. They want to make her dorm into an example for the rest of the campus. She is currently working on graduate school applications, which are all online. The housing administration is refusing to turn the internet back on, and this is almost definitely affecting her chance of getting in, causing her great mental anguish. Their library closes at 4 PM on Friday for the entire weekend, and there is no where else on campus where she can get internet access (it's a very small school). She's speaking to the dean of the college tomorrow, and doesn't know what to say to him beyond the obvious.
This past Friday, my wife and I went for my appointment with a urologist, with much uncertainty. We live in the deep south, and would be considered "young" by most, in our mid-twenties. We did our best to be presentable (without looking like we dressed up) and showed up early with all our paperwork in order. We also made sure to get conference with one of the youngest doctors in the practice, for good measure. Our big concern was that the practice is part of a large, Christian-based health center, complete with Bible verses on the walls.   After the initial check-in and new patient checks, we were directed to one of the doctor's waiting rooms. We had been given a small pamphlet upon leaving the check-in room, so we thumbed through that while we waited. After maybe 10 minutes of eternity, the doctor came in, looking slightly steeled (Because this is a general urology office, with 6 or so doctors, we weren't very easily able to skirt around the intake questions as to why we wanted to see a doctor). He introduced himself, then we got into the meat of the conversation.   He went over the expected things, like making sure we knew it was medically considered a permanent procedure with no guarantee of reversal, asking how much thought we had put into it, if we had considered alternatives, and what our long term goals would be with the procedure. We told him our bit: that our GP had given us a referral last year, and asked that we give it some good thought; that we both had medical concerns between my hearing loss and my wife's Fibro, plus my family history and her lack thereof (being adopted). We also told him that if, for some reason we did change our minds down the road, we were both very open and available to adopting, what with my wife herself being adopted.   In summary, he said something along the lines of: he's always concerned with younger people coming in. Given the facts that we have clearly give it a good bit of thought and consideration, and came in  together  to discuss it, and had alternatives if something  were  to change in the future, he had no personal issues with performing a vasectomy on me. He explained the procedure as their office does it and fielded any questions from us. Had me drop trou (which my wife giggled at, then promptly apologized for. He thought it amusing though) to see what he was working with, then said we're good to set up an appointment.   We've got it set up for soon after Memorial Day (our scheduling conflicts made it later than sooner), so we hope to be worry free that!
Warning:  This might be a tad long.  However, if you feel like hearing someone pull themselves up from the bottom, while contemplating the future, please read on.  Any words of wisdom go a long way too.   A bit of backstory here, I'm in my mid-20s.  My college career has been less than stellar.  A once 18 year old overachiever eventually dropped out of his EE program after two years of stress and financial burden.  My father lost his job, I worked full time with school (2.5 hour/day commute) and just realized I was wasting my time and money on something I couldn't give 110% into.   Don't get me wrong, I loved the field.  I just didn't have the time to dedicate to the demanding coursework.  Working 40+ hours/week and maintaining 12 credits was a rough way to go.  I was averaging 3-5 hours of sleep per night and at it 7 days per week.  After 2 years, I eventually just shut down and for sanity's sake decided my health was more important than grades.  On top of that, it was still difficult affording school.  Driving a SUV with gas @ $4.00/gallon didn't do much to help the matter.   I left the University and hit the local Community College to decompress for a bit.  While my father found a job after a few months, it wouldn't be until last year that family income was back to pre-recession levels.  I chose to take some electives in order to keep my Financial Aid/insurance.   I stumbled upon a professor teaching classes in Homeland Security.  I took it on a lark, although I have always been interested in such things.  As it turns out, I found out that the Comm College had a 70/30 agreement with another local University.  Most of my credits from the Engineering Program should transfer over as well.  Success.   In the mean time, I was spotted at my beer league hockey game by a coach of another University a few hours north.  He showed up to watch his son and asked me to skate for him.  Offered me a spot on their club team.  Unfortunately, I had to turn this down due to family obligations.   I've been chipping away at the required courses.  Taking a mix of online electives and on-campus coursework.  The online classes help me maintain my status for Financial Aid while boosting my GPA.  They're easy enough to where I can focus more on my core classes.   In the meantime, I scored a wonderful job with a local non-profit.  I started as a "support" worker and busted my ass for the past year.  Ended up becoming what is essentially a patient advocate in a local hospital.  Good pay, great retirement, 5+ weeks paid off per year (sick, vacation, personal, paid holidays) and insurance that costs me $0 out of pocket.  The best part is, this is in a growing field where I can make a name for myself.  I have a great management team behind me that wants nothing more than for me to succeed.  I'd love to make a career out of this place.  In the past year, I've paid off all my debt (outside a relatively small amount of student loans), gotten back into shape, been able to help out the family, and started putting money away for a Corvette or similar.  Hell, I almost bought a house until I realized I might want to relocate in the next few years.   On Monday, I am visiting the new University to begin my transfer paperwork.  After this semester, I will be transferring.  Unfortunately, it seems as though a great deal of my coursework from University 1 does not transfer to University 2.  However, it looks as though quite a bit transfers if the agreement would allow me to transfer credits from University 1 to the Community College and onto University 2.   If all goes well, I am done next spring and can begin grad school, as well as the rest of my life.  Work seems pretty flexible as far as working around any sort of internship I would have in the future.   On the flip side, there is another possibility.  If the credits do not transfer, I will most likely be attending another University.  They are about 4 hours north, and are arguably better as far as Public Safety programs go.  A lot of the classes they offer at an extension centre which is about an hour away.   The worst possible case is that the extension centre does not offer the courses I need and I am forced to move 4 hours away.  I do have family in the area, and my sister even attends that University.  I have kept my second job and could most likely transfer to a store in the area, so would have a nominal income.  Hell, I could even possibly play college hockey if I felt up to it.   However, I'd hate to throw away such a good life I've begun to build for myself.  The only good part is I could eventually work my way back to a similar position in the future.  I'm fully prepared to do whatever I need to do in order to make this work.  In the grand scheme of things, it will be a lot easier than what I've dealt with before.  It would just a struggle, albeit temporarily.   At least I should have this all sorted out in the next few weeks.  I have held off all major purchases (non-beater car, house), sold my other "sporty" car, stopped going out, etc. until April.  The Government contract I currently work under is up for renewal then, and I decided it would be best to be thrifty until everything is 110%
UPDATE:  Well, things seem to be going in the wrong direction. Went to her room to see if she wanted to hangout, and when i got there she was sitting on the couch with another guy I had never met. We then proceded to awkwardly meet each other before I made up a lame excuse to leave. After looking at this guy's facebook page, I saw that he was from the same hometown as my crush, which would suggest that they new each other already. And that road trip she was going to go on is off. She said she was staying this weekend. I guess I know now who she will be with.  I feel stupid. I guess she's just out of my league. I think i've fallen into the "I dont look old enough" trap. (This new guy is a sophmore, im a freshman). Im not saying that im done pursuing her, but I think that there is a one in a million chance of me being with her. This is my first time being friendzoned, and its not a good feeling.
We have been in a realationship for almost 2 years, and generally, its doing pretty well. I see her once a week usually (different schools), and i would say were very much inlove. There's just one thing thats not helping at all. Lately, it seems we have NOTHING in common with each other. She likes to talk about one thing, i like talking about another, she has her opinion, mines the oppisite, and we each seem to never want to admit we're wrong. This leads to small fights every few weeks that dont end very well. I have tried my best to get involved in what she likes, vise versa for her too, but it doesnt really seem to work out in the end. Any tips on how to avoid fights when different opinions come up?
SI]( conversions:     12ft = 3.66 m     > I know that exact feeling. I work at a boat rental and one day a guy dropped his keys in the water. It was only 12ft^(3.66 ^m)  deep so I dove down and got them. He thanked me profusely and even gave me $20. Later that same day I was at the main boat ramp and my coworker and I saw a child struggling in the water by the docks. We jumped in the water, swam over, and got her back to the dock. When we got to the dock, her mom pulled her up by her arm, yelled at her for swimming out too far, and then scolded us before turning around and leaving.  >  >
I was hungry and fading at work. I needed something to keep me going, so I got a little something chocolate flavored for myself and snarfed it down without giving it a glance. Within the hour, I was feeling like I might lose control of my bowels at any second. Every fart was a huge risk. By the end of the day I was pleading with imagined demons to take away my gut-agony if it would please them to see me shit myself right there on the drive home.
The problem is that the word is not dissociated yet. It's a weird thing. The more you use it, the closer it becomes to dissociated from its original meaning. Unfortunately, it simultaneously harbors a safe space for violence and hate. Gay people are still beaten and assaulted and killed, and freely using the word 'faggot' encourages this. In order for the complete change, a critical mass of society needs to move past it, and that hasn't happened yet, and won't happen soon either.
This is not my GF, this is a girl I knew from High School (and even before that).   About a year ago, I wake up to my sister calling me saying that I need to check out this girl's Facebook pictures.  I thought they were of me and her when I was younger so I fell back to sleep.   I wake up, get dressed and begin to walk to the train when I read an eMail from my friend with the subject "HOLY WHORE BATMAN".  I immediately stop and open this eMail.  He tells everyone to go on Facebook and check out this girl's pictures.  I literally drop everything, open Facebook on my iPhone, and I am literally stunned.  After browsing the pictures for a few seconds (minutes),  I read the first post from her friend saying "This is (girl) and these pictures are not of me and whoever did this will be in serious trouble because my parents are IT managers at (redacted)."  I am dying laughing at this point.   Turns out whoever did this, did it the right way.  I assume a guy she fucked over had these pictures and posted them to her Facebook page.  Not only that, but he changed the password & eMail address on her account so she couldn't reset it to remove the pictures.  These pictures were up for everyone to look at for about 8 hours until Facebook took them down.   [Link to pictures, Enjoy](   [eMail send from my friends on May 27th of last year](
If it's actually bipartisan (as opposed to called bipartisan because one person from another party agreed) then I bet it's riddled with compromise, won't do anything substantial, will wast tax-payer money, and benefit a host of corporations. The only bipartisan bills in the last 2 years have been the war in Afghanistan and the bailouts. Bipartisan in the context of this election season means that the Democrats passed a lousy bill because they caved to republican pressure to castrate the legislation.   Furthermore, on this specific issue, looking to the republicans for help define a "climate change" bill is like Spain looking for a westward route to China from people who think the world is flat.
My parent's next door nieghbours have been brutal. They would call the cops on 15-20 kids who lived on the street for playing road hockey (clearly from Canada) and one time the cops just got out and asked for some sticks and played for a bit. They've come out after we had finished a road hockey game and smashed our nets or steal equiptment that gets left outside. They've called the police on us for countless noise violations including 12:05 am on New Year's Eve to have 2 cruisers show up at our house and find my parents and some faimly friends (4 people) in the hot tub out back. The best one though would be calling the cops on my Dad's 50th brithday party, and I have no idea what BS they made up, but they got a helicopter, 3 cruisers and a van to show up. My back deck was filled with middle aged people waving at a police helicopter. I can't even imagine the amount of police resources they have wasted.
Etho, creator and maintainer of the Mindcrack server, he has molded it to this recognizable and successful "brand" that a ton of people of the Minecraft community enjoy.   But if I had to choose someone other than Etho, it'd be Etho. Why? Because he's great at building, redstone, map making, invented UHC and the prank wars, he's highly entertaining, his editing is amazing. Let's not forget he has basically done a lot for the "brand" itself like making the website, logo, and the subreddit. There's a million more reasons why he's made the biggest impact but I think I have made my point.
You  four years ago, here...   Others have said "don't try to over-analyze it," "block her on FB, delete her from everything," etc.... While cleansing her from your social life is possible, and recommended, it will be impossible to  not  over-analyze.   You'll run it through your head constantly. You'll imagine her with him. You'll wonder why she said "Now i need space. From both of you." and you'll decide what this means is this was not a one-time thing and he's also in her life and by "both of you" she means you're somehow equals. And I hate to point it out but you'll discover it soon if you haven't already: he's someone she'll see again and she's probably with him right now. That pain is something you can't hide from. Soon, you'll create that pain in your head. It's like pinching yourself.   As I'm typing this I'm realizing it echoes Ron Livingston's advice to Jon Favreau in  Swingers : "Eventually, you miss the pain." Watch that. Watch loads of sappy movies. Listen to things that make you sad. That's fine for a while. Cry. Drink. Feel sorry for yourself. We all do it and I personally think it's part of the process; we need to do it.   Then, a week or two from now, get off your ass and get away from everything. I mean really go somewhere. Plan a vacation and go by yourself (or bring a friend or two, but spend  lots  of time by yourself). What you need to do is figure out exactly who you are, again, absent her -- this other part of your life and someone you'd planned to spend the rest of your life with. Think about what steps you need to take to create a fulfilling life for yourself, completely disregarding the possibility of any other future dates or lovers until you've got a handle on who you are, again. Sure, fuck like crazy if you're able (because touching and kissing and being appreciated is pretty awesome) but don't try to fill her void with another girl, and don't stray from your goal of finding fulfillment for yourself as an individual again. The rest -- the finding someone else -- that will take care of itself.   Good luck.
Psychologist in rural area here. The Budget is not the win for mental health services that the media is heralding from governmental PR.   Much of the spending is delayed for 4-5 years andwill be funneled into a bureaucratic Commission, non-professional carers who do not provide actual treatment (more like the lifestyle carers of other people with disabilities) and removed from direct care provision.   The big furphy here is that the governments are cutting front line services NOW. Most people seeing mental health professionals (other than in the hospital system which is seriously over stressed) see their GP's and mental health professionals through a program which they have just reduced through the 2011-2012 budget. This means people will be paying for their own treatment again if they can,  missing out if they can't  and we will see private services closing/Gp's reducing their willingness to refer to services and relying more on medication only. Don't be fooled.   The GP/ mental health program I describe was evaluated by the government's own reviewers as bridging gaps and being excellent value for tax money as late as March and still they do this. The budget is directing money away from direct professional care and the government wants us to be blinded by their "good news" PR. It's a budget fail.
I guess I'll just jump right in, I was in a relationship with a girl for 5 years, we were engaged for 3 of those years. I loved and still love this girl to death, even though I realize that being together is no longer an option. She called me the other day. I was about to fall asleep, and I see her calling, so I sleepily answer, ask what's up, the usual conversation when she calls, which isn't often at all anymore. She says she is in Vegas. Living there now, loves it. I knew she'd gone to Vegas. I don't know why she wants to live there, but she says she loves it. Only bad part is she can't find a job. She proceeds to tell me that her money is running out, and she is going to do what it takes to make money. To stay there. I ask "But not THAT, right? You aren't actually thinking about becoming a prostitute?" Silence on the other end. "Yeah, I'm thinking about it. I don't know what else to do. I can't find a job." she says. I felt sick by this point. Thinking of this girl, this particular girl that means so much to me, that at one point I would have done anything for, out on the street and doing what I would never want anyone to be forced into doing. The thought has consumed me for two days now. I don't by any means make enough to support her in Vegas. Even so, I know it's not my job to support her. I am sending her a few hundred bucks from my next paycheck, but the fact of the matter is, she needs a job. So, Redditors, my friends, the community I turn to for answers nearly every day, please help me. She needs a job, and I need to do this to save someone who desperately needs it. What I'm looking for is someone in Vegas or who has contacts in Vegas, who knows of any available jobs. She is small, around 100 pounds, so it couldn't be anything with heavy lifting. She is intelligent and beautiful, and has worked as a model quite a lot before. I know this probably won't get much attention, but any help is very appreciated.
When I was 15 I was sent to a boarding school, some boarding schools in Denmark dosen't allow for students to stay more than a single year. This school however allowed students to stay up to 3 years. That resulted in second and third year students passing down all kinds of different shit to second-year-to-be students. The most famous things was, a 5 year old brie, a box filled with onion (mostly rotten onions), a ball made of pubic hair getting bigger each year and finally, a soda bottle filled urine.. And half a carrot.  And per tradition, last night of the school year, all who dared lined up. and took a whiff of the bottle. First its not so bad, but after 2-3 second the smell hits you. Hard i might add, the smell of rotten vegtable and urine, but with a sour and salty after effect. the worst is the burning sensation like trying to snort a flame from a lighter, The gagging almost choked me, most people was laying on the floor with tears in their eyes and their hands covering their faces, screams of agony echoing through the building.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
I really hate to say this, and I don't necessarily have any proof that this is the case with your family. However, you should be incredibly careful with any information that you find on Ancestry.com, because often this information is gathered from false sources. It's not that anyone is passing around false information on purpose. It's more like a bad game of telephone that stretches over generations.   If you're interested you should look up some information about a man named Gustav Anjou or the Horn Papers. Gustav (not his real name) was born in Sweden in the 1860's and immigrated to the US in the 1890's. Families could hire him for thousands of dollars to research their family history. To meet their high expectations he would put together these elaborate "family trees" and impressive family coats of arms. He would always find that they had some relation to someone really famous (nobility, Charlemagne, etc.). Almost all of these genealogies that have come to surface have been found to be completely fabricated.   So, when the internet came around, these fake family trees were posted by great-great grandchildren who didn't know any better. This information was then downloaded and reposted over and over, and the source information got lost somewhere down the line. With the advent of Ancestry.com people could now repost this information with the click of a mouse. Thus, these myths continue to be repeated again and again.   Once again, I'm not saying this is necessarily the case in your family. But, you need to be very weary of any information that you find online (particularly if it leads back hundreds of generations with very little primary evidence other than a personal family history). If you want some more information check out the Family Search Center run by the church of latter day saints (Mormons). I think you might find it an interesting read...
Ok so I am in a state of severe anxiety and depression at the moment, I do not know where I am going or what I am doing. I have been in a really close relationship with my girlfriend since I was 16 and I have known her forever. She is not only my girlfriend, she is my best friend and we have had some really good times, I am part of her family, she is part of mine.   We have loved each other unconditionally and been there for each other 24 hours a day. I can not remember a day when we have not been speaking, we are either texting each other or with each other.   I have been through so much with her, she was there for me when a close family member was going through a terminal illness and I was there for her when her family member was seriously ill. We have shared family holidays, christmas', dreams of an idyllic future and it has slowly been being demolished for the past 2 years.   I have been going through periods of hatred and wanting to be alone, I suffer from anxiety and depression and I have blamed and she has always been there to support my condition.   For the past year I have been doing drugs behind her back as an escape, a way to be myself, free and rebellious. I have partied hard and it was my own sick little secret, I would never lie usually but I didn't really feel like I was lying, anyway the truth is out and that situation has been sorted with the option of her or the drugs, I obviously picked her.   It has pissed me off though, putting me in that predicament and it has made me realise, do I really want this? I like to take drugs and party, that is me, I like to have fun and live on the edge and she is stopping that. I have now started thinking I am not an individual, she is not letting me be me and enjoy what I do. The drugs are only one aspect obviously but I am just stating them because I am scared I am coming to this decision in an attempt to pick drugs over her, which knocks me sick. When I say drugs I mean party drugs, nothing like Heroin.   I have always been a very outgoing and independent guy, I like to socialise and entertain people. I hate going out and getting drunk with her and her mates because I feel I cannot be me, I prefer to go out alone, free and away with the world.   I want to travel, but alone, meet new people, experience the world and have some fun, but I feel she will be a burden.   I feel like this relationship is coming to a dreaded end although I do love her, as I write this now I just want her in my arms but I feel like I need to make a decision.   An independent life, enjoying being a young guy for the few years I have left or conform to society, stay with the 'woman of my dreams' get married get a job have kids and die happy because I shared every moment with her?   Please somebody just discuss this with me, am I wrong? am I sick? am I an idiot?
Shes what? 23? 24? Literally same age as me (and a good portion of other redditors). Shes been in the acting game since maybe early to late teens? But really hasnt been a household name since what? 4? 5 years ago? This girl, much like many of us, probably has seen many a Jack Nicholson movies. The man is an acting legend. So for her, still a newbie mind you to the whole world wide fame thing, to actually get Jack to come to her (and not the other way around) and give her some praise (someone im sure she looked up to as an actress) probably meant a lot to her. If I was in her position I would have reacted the same way "holy shit was that jack nicholson? That WAS jack nicholson! He gave me praise?"
You deserve that game because you exist!   No one thinks this. No one has this thought process. You're making it up. No one thinks they deserve something solely for existing.   > You wanted it and you're alive so fuck everything else, you get that game!   This doesn't mean that you have a "right" or a "just claim" to it. It means you want it. You're making it more than it is.   > No one "deserves" games. No one has the "right" to games. It's a privilege. It's a luxury item you earn by having the money the creators demands.   I've said basically this already, except that some people do deserve and have a right to games (namely, paying customers). I'm not sure what the point of you repeating me here is.   > Don't agree with what they're asking for? Then you don't fucking get the product!   The problem is, you  can  get the product if you don't agree with what they're asking for. There's nothing substantial in place to prevent you from doing so. That has nothing to do with whether you deserve it or have a right to it.   > If you really want to take a moral stand, learn to live without the fucking game and do something else.   I also don't understand the point of you saying this. Of course, if you want to take the moral stand, you would not pirate the game. But people who pirate games don't take the moral stand. I don't see the connection with entitlement.   > Just because you don't want to put up with the "corporate profit whoring" does not mean you get to make that decision, and THEN get the product the "corporate profit whoring" brought into existence.   As for the corporate profit whoring in particular, that's things like exclusive pre-order content, expensive DLC, pricing above standard game prices, etc. This corporate profit whoring did NOT bring the game into existence. The developers who created the game brought it into existence. Most developers have stated they don't like these slimy tactics, but what can they do about it? The people who give them the funds to make games can make stupid calls like that and the developers can't do anything about it.   > That's why it's entitlement. It's wanting to prove a point, but still not being able to live without their precious video game.   You've just said "That's why it's entitlement. It's [statement that doesn't show how it's entitlement]." They're not entitled to play the game. They just want to play it. Either you're being intentionally unclear, or you're unfamiliar with the actual definition of entitlement.   > You know, the thing they're supposed to be boycotting.   You're missing the point. People want to play the game. People don't want to encourage producers to put out things like $15 day one DLC. That's bullshit. If it's day one DLC, it should be on the base game. It's the business practice people don't like, not the game itself. That's not to say they  should  pirate if they don't agree with it. Personally, I think people should just not do anything. Don't buy it, don't play it. But that's beside the point. It has nothing to do with why pirating does or doesn't involve a sense of entitlement.   > It's entitlement because they deserve it because their alive, and playing it off as morals is demeaning to people who actually boycott things by living without.   They  don't  deserve it, and that's the  entire point . I'm saying that I think most people who pirate don't think they deserve it, they just want it. The people who do think they deserve are entitled. I've never disagreed with that. All I'm saying is the perception that all people who pirate video games feel a sense of entitlement is misguided and grossly exaggerated. And I don't know why you keep bringing up morals. I never said anything about the morality of the situation. We're not in disagreement about that. Anyone who says it's morally right to pirate games is obviously full of shit. No one actually believes that. Stop it with the straw man stuff.   >
Ok, Without getting into a HUGE background I was in a long distance relationship (I live in USA, She lives in Mexico) shes in college and thought about going to masters school here, but that changed and she needs work experience and shes going to be in Mexico for a long time probably now. She has a house here (Her and her family used to live here) and she visits ever couple months.   Lately our communication has been light because of conflicting schedules and maybe I've just been in the mindset "out of sight out of mind" so to say and it seemed like a constant chore to get in contact / Skype with her. A month ago we talked for a little and came up with a mutual agreement that logically breaking up would be the best idea, and that we would still be friends, I was feeling optimistic and agreed. ever since then, she barely talks to me, every time we talk she seems happy and joyful and I just feel lonely and sad when we talk, and the thought of her with anyone else makes me sick and heartbroken (I believe she might be seeing someone right now 99% sure, but don't know if its serious).   Shes here visiting right now with 2 friends, and I hung out with her last night and i felt really lonely the whole time because its not like it used to be. I was thinking of tonight, telling her how I feel, and that we should give it another shot. Basically an ultimatum that We try and work it out, or nothing at all, I cant take thinking about her, and talking occasionally to her It makes me feel just awful and lonely every time we speak. Her family and friends love me, they ask me whats going on and I tell them, the responses I've gotten so far is that she really loves me, but the distance and communication is fucking us up. - my lack of experience is killing me, I'm 26m and have never really been in a healthy lengthy relationship   What do you think and does that sound like a good thing to do?

The testing technique is not foolproof. It can identify the substances in a supplement, but it cannot determine their potency. And because the technology relies on the detection of DNA, it may not be able to identify concentrated chemical extracts that do not contain genetic material, or products in which the material has been destroyed by heat and processing.   So this automatically excludes any pharmaceutical grade extractions of chemicals? If you had "100% Pure Caffeine Isolate from Coffee" test would spit out a false positive. Doesn't anyone see how ridiculous that is?   This test would miss a number of substances that could be isolated from "natural" sources.     Quinine: Used to treat malaria and is synthesized from cinchona bark.   Digoxin: Used to treat heart conditions and is derived from foxglove.   Diacetylmorphine: This drug is better known by its trade name, "heroin." Heroin was sold as a non-addictive substitute for the naturally occurring morphine found in poppy plants.   Aspirin: Also known as acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin is an artificial reproduction of salicin, which is found in willow bark.   Taxol: An antitumor drug derived from the bark of the Pacific yew.   Caffeine: Everybody loves it, could be derived from wheat grass, green tea, coffee, and a number of other plants.   Omega-3 fatty acids: Currently used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and myocardial infarction. May have other potential applications. Derived from a variety of marine life.   L-DOPA: Used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and dystonia and can be synthesized from velvet bean.     There are countless others that aren't included on this list.   Personally would not buy supplements that contain  any  plant material. The active ingredient  should be  isolated and standardized. I have literally been involved in the isolation process on a number of occasions. I have read the HPLC results with my own eyes.

True the Fed has been buying bonds (QEI and QEII) but like anything else this keeps the price of bonds high which effectively means the return on them i.e. the interest you receive, is lower. When the Fed stops buying bonds and/or raises its base rate, interest rates will go up and the value of existing bonds will go down. Banks use the bonds as collateral and so having high value bonds keeps them solvent. When the value of their bonds goes down enough they become insolvent. The Fed's main job is to make sure that never happens, essentially by printing money, which devalues the dollar. Some devaluation is good because it makes US imports more expensive and exports cheaper in other countries (in New Zealand you can get a new Dodge Caliber for ~$33,000 now!!). Too much devaluation is not so good, especially if you have to import oil.
It's complicated, and very situational.  As I mentioned in my other reply, you had some instances in which factories never produced anything useful, either because of intention (Oskar Schindler) or because the workers were in too poor physical condition (the IG Farben plant at Auschwitz).   Other situations, however, were quite productive--Mauthausen, in modern-day Austria, had munitions factories and a quarry, and was apparently quite profitable.  In fact, even at less successful camps, private companies were making huge profits by renting slave laborers from the SS at extremely cheap prices.  It's pretty clear that as far as private industry goes, the practice was profitable.   Now for the German government and/or the SS, it's a more complicated and contentious question.  The Nazis did make a great deal of money from the Holocaust, but this included confiscated property as well as slave labor, and my knowledge gets hazier the further into proper economics we get.  Perhaps someone else knows more.   You also have to take into account that part of the "profit" of slave labor was the eventual death of the laborers from malnutrition or disease exacerbated by overwork.  The idea of "extermination through labor" ( Vernichtung durch Arbeit ) was central to the concentration camp system, especially where Jews were concerned, the logic being that if the Germans were going to kill these people anyway, the Reich might as well get something out of it along the way.
I'm 26, male and in a somewhat good relationship. I recently graduated from college, have a part time job but have been searching for a career, got a few interviews. I still live at home with my family. Things should be fine. Life's progressing, always moving forward, but I'm still depressed. I don't eat, I don't sleep, I don't want to go out with friends or family.  My girlfriend has been the one thing that makes life worth living for me. However, I don't get to spend much time with her. Her parents are racist and they forbid her to go out with me. She continues to see me behind their backs but she's not there for me when I need her. I feel like shit every time I get mad at her because I feel like she's abandoned me. So, recently I've been pushing her away. Fights for no reason. Constantly ask her to leave her house and move out with me. She refuses even though she has no real reason to live at home. I want a change, but I don't think it will matter. I don't know why I'm so depressed. Why I have no self worth. Why any goals I had no longer matter. Why I think that even if I get what I want in the future, that I still won't be happy. I feel my time is running out. I'm at the point where suicide seems like the best option. I don't want to bring my girlfriend down with me, she has enough problems of her own. Not being with me would benefit her a lot. Not because I've been making her miserable, I haven't. Quite the opposite. Just, I think she can do better. A lot better.  Any ways, I don't know what I really expected to gain from writing this. It's all scattered and doesn't really have a point. Kinda like my life.
Well if you look back to 85 when the Knicks won correct me if i'm wrong but the drawing was on live tv? Why isn't it live? I don't see a reason why they have to be locked into a room with "special" lotterly balls. Arn't all ping pong balls the same? Why do they have to have them in a special case to be specifically used for the lottery. Lebron james leaves and BOOM the Cavs have the #1 pick. What were the chances that the Bulls got the #1 pick a few years ago and drafted the hometown player. Btw isnt there a rule that states that a team can give up their first round draft pick and automatically sign a hometown player? Out of subjust but anyways.
It's simple. Oil companies, for better or for worse, make the world go around. We need oil to function, as we do not yet have fully viable alternative that we can switch to first thing tomorrow. We need them, so therefor they can get off with being evil.   The banking and insurance industries are in a similar position. The current US economy is catered to facilitate the current model of capitalism, where no one does anything for the goodness of their hearts. If you want to live a life of mediocre success with a family, a house and car. We all need money and our health. You'll need to rely on the two necessary evils to get there and maintain it. We need these evil bastards. They know it. We know it.   EA on the other hand, is a completely different story. They are in the business of luxury goods production and sales, and are in no way as important as the oil, insurance or banking industries. No one relies in the same way on the gaming industry to survive and get ahead in life. Should EA disappear as a company it would have no worse consequence than people spending their money elsewhere. On either another gaming company, or perhaps some other luxury industry all together. Music, Movie, TV, Fashion, Electronics, etc. We don't need EA in any capacity other than to indulge our privileged need to kill spare time. They on the other hand need us, a fact they seemingly do not understand. Customer satisfaction should be everything to them, but somewhere along the line the arrogance and greed took over, and they lost sight of their role in life.   You can't boycott oil, banks or the insurance companies if you want to lead a successful, healthy and happy life. You can try, but you won't live as good a life as you could, and you will fall behind the pack trotting on to further success.  We can however boycott EA without it ever affecting us in the long run. They are just a video game company, and the only ones truly dependent on them are their employees.
I've read this a couple of times now, and I find it incredibly discouraging because it emphasizes the absurdity involved in an academic career. We have to teach, research, publish and serve all while walking these swinging tightropes of academic politics and unspoken expectations.   Items 1 and 2 tell us to seek guidance and evaluation from multiple sources, which inevitably results in conflicting advice and critique that we have to sort out. Items 3, 4, 5 and 10 amount to avoiding extremes and sticking to the elusive middle roads. Numbers 6 and 9 just point out the minefield of organizational politics (thanks, I hadn't noticed).   Number 14 reminds us to not cheat, which is an important warning, but is anyone who is tempted to dishonesty going to read this and suddenly decide to not plagiarize or fudge their numbers after all? Numbers 11 -13 tell us how to shape our research program and who to work with, which  might  be good advice for those in the social sciences, but doesn't really work for all fields.   And then there are my favorites. Number 8: you're going to fail or disappoint in lots of ways, but, hey, just shake it off! Number 15: Despite all this vague advice about how to conform in academia, don't forget to be yourself.   Maybe it's just the end-of-semester exhaustion fueling my response, but I feel like this "advice" is just an established academic trying to scare and bully untenured faculty to conformity. Instead of telling us how to not sabotage our careers, why don't the academics in power make an effort to change some of the systems that make it unnecessarily difficult to succeed?  That  would be helpful.
Hi All,   So I met my now ex off of OKCupid in August of this year. We hit it off surprisingly well; sex was great right off the bat, we had a lot in common, we made each other laugh, etc.   We continued to date, and became official in October. We spent tons of time together, going out for dinner, meeting her and my friends/family. We even had a good talk of how our dating/blooming relationship seemed "different" from others we had, and that a spark was really there. I was getting ready to really settle with her.   In November, she had to go on a business trip in Ottawa and was gone for a week. The next week she was on a trip to Jamaica to see family. We managed to stay in touch by phone and Skype, and had good, lengthy conversations just about everything, and we seemed fine. We even planned a trip to see her friends in the States for this past weekend.   I was sick the following week and we were unable to see each other, but again everything seemed okay.   This past weekend, we went out to see some of her friends in the US. I got along well with her friends; we saw a hockey game together, took in some sights etc.  She was a little less affectionate, but she usually acts like that if we are in a group of friends, so no radars went off there for me.   I come home after work today, we had "the talk" over the phone. She said she just "doesn't feel the same way" she did at the beginning and can't explain it. She claims there was nothing I did during the trip. I prodded her a bit more, and she said  "I got used to the 'single' feeling while we were apart for November" and "we are at different stages in our lives", both seemingly vague answers. I tried to press for more specifics, but nothing.   She told me she spoke at length about it with her roommates(both of whom have track records of picking apathetic, selfish, generally abusive boyfriends) and came to this decision.   I feel the roomies put some pressure on her, because it just doesn't feel right how abruptly this ended. Could it be because I'm still establishing my legal career? I'm going to college for paralegal studies PT, working FT as a legal assistant, I will make it. Is it because I don't have that amazing job yet, and I can't give her a nice house? I felt really close with her, and things were going so well. It just seems it came out of nowhere, and she didn't seem genuine when she was saying what she was saying.
I love coffee and often make Americanos/Latte/cappucinos for myself and my friends. But not all them like the taste of coffee, and that's fine. But what would be a good way to use steamed milk and/or foam to make some amazing hot chocolate, or even a tea beverage of some sort? Open to other non-coffee drinks as well. Or even drinks that don't incorporate steamed milk.
Backstory first: A friend of mine used to know Megan Fox, so I'd met her a few times way back when she was not nearly as famous as she is now.   So I show up to the Body Shop on Sunset Blvd here in LA and me and my buddy are hanging back trying not to attract too much attention since we don't have a lot of cash. Girl starts walking up to us and I try to wave her away like 'Naahhhh not interested' thinking it's a lapdance offer. Smoking hot girl comes right up to me and gives me a big hug and says 'Cerealeater! How are you?'. I had mistaken Megan for one of the dancers there. She invited us to sit with her at the stage and we hung out getting a free show thanks to her generous friends, which included Ozzy Osbourne's son (I forget his name).
My current boyfriend that I have been with for 4-ish months now is making me doubt my trust in him. We started talking on Tinder (of all the places!) in February, this year while he and his ex (who he lived with) were on a break. During their break we really hit it off, he's a med student and I'm a vet student so we had a lot of interesting discussions and similar interests. Although, after a month of talking he got back together with his ex again. He explained to me that he wanted to try to make things work with her which, at the time I could understand so, we deleted each other from any social media etc.  After a week or so he added me back on snapchat and began being flirty with me but would delete me most nights just to re-add me in the morning (obviously during the time he was with his ex he would delete me)  To cut a long story short, she found out he was doing this, it ended and now we're together. He says he's happy that we are together and that the reason he kept in touch with me was because he wasn't happy in the relationship and wanted to be with me.   However, my problem is that he is overly protective of his phone. I'm aware he talks to girls that I don't really know, mainly through snapchat that he claims are just friends.  He has a history of being unfaithful that he will openly talk about.  He constantly comments on other girls appearances (how hot they are etc)   I feel as though I'm fairly laid back but I feel as though I don't fully trust him yet.   Any advise is appreciated!
You can check my posting history for the nitty-gritty but I'll try to summarize it all neatly here.   The first year of our relationship was wonderful.  At the end of the first year bf had a bad head injury (ruptured ear drum after a hit to the head, followed by lingering infection) which took almost a year to heal.  During this time he became very (arguably clinically) depressed.  This escalated to control issues rearing their head, breaking things around the house, yelling, and finally two months ago today he hit me.  We have been separated ever since.   I have been going to a free class for victims of domestic violence and doing a lot of research and thinking and talking with friends about all of it.  I had hoped my bf would see a therapist and attend a Violence Intervention/Anger Management class - he did, once with the therapist, did the intake and one orientation class, but has stopped altogether with both already.  I went with him to one therapy session; I get a lot out of it, he doesn't seem to take it seriously.   We were developing land together, building a house together, we have a lot livestock together.  I love my animals so much and not seeing them for the past two months (I've been living in my old house that my family owns) is heartbreaking.  Giving up on the home I had already picked out paint for is devastating.  Seeing people around town that know us as this power-couple and smiling and saying everything is fine kills me.  We were running a business together, busy and active in the community, well-known as a couple.   Some days, I daydream about moving away and starting over, immersing myself in a new town and 'hakuna matata'-ing it up.  Some days, I can only think about ways to work it out with him.  We've tried meeting up and spending some nights together since, or having normal 'dates' but it always ends with his control issues flaring and me feeling pressured and stressed and pushing him back away.  I push myself so hard to extend an olive branch and when I first see him, I'm so happy to see him, but then as we start talking I realize he's just overcome with control and stress and has become this monster of a man I used to love.   It really does seem like I'm starting to know that it's over, but it's so fucking hard.  I feel like I'm not just giving up the man I love - I think I've done that already - but giving up all my animals, and my dream house, and that life I had been planning, is what's hard for me.  I guess hearing of similar scenarios, or advice, or whatever you think might be helpful would be appreciated.
That's some solid fucking advice right there! I would like to really stress that community college is something you should definitely do if you do not have a substantial scholarship to a four year university. The first two years of college is for some reason just a slightly (like very slightly) harder version of high school where they just rehash a bunch of stuff you should have learned already. With the way the college system is now in the U.S. The first two years is basically just a big money grab.
I was raised in a similar situation.   I honestly had to adapt my faith to what I was learning, as I was (like yourself) raised in a highly conservative atmosphere.  I'd say that that was the most challenging atmosphere.  It took me sitting down with my uncle (who actually was born and raised agnostic and transferred into the church I was raised in when he was forty-five) who is an aerospace-engineer.  We had a long talk, and we still have these discussions, about reconciling our faith with science.  Another member of my congregation used to be an astrophysicist who worked for NASA, so I've had similar conversations with him.  Finally, my dad was a mathematics major and taught math for a long time.  He continues to study developments in math and science in his free time and he helps me too.
The earlier the game (and this is all games, not just R & S) the bigger certain features are. Mario's entire face in the first games is eyes, nose, hair. This is because the technology was limited, and it was necessary to highlight those features to make something recognizable.   Crash Bandicoot's face is basically his entire front. The low poly count meant that in order to be recognizable, again, the primary features humans use to recognize a face had to be enlarged.   Ratchet and Clank one comes out. PS2 is more powerful, the head and face don't have to dominate the entire character's design. But they are still pretty large so that they read at a distance.   With the PS3, the detail you can render is huge. If Ratchet had big huge facial features at that resolution, he would look creepy, or like Spongebob. So his look is portioned to be slightly more realistic, within the bounds of a cartoon universe.   [Also, other famous characters sometimes change in design over time.](
After scoring 5 12 win arena runs in November I thought I had finally figured it all out. The gold and packs were rising faster than they had ever before. I was the man...and the LoE meta hit. Shit got hard and the variance was insane.   I had only one run hit 12 in December. The decks i was facing were nuts. I had lethal set up playing rogue against a mage and was topdicked reno'd at 9 wins. WTF, kind of variance that asshole needed to be able to hit that god only knows. One run I was double MCT'd which tilted me so hard that i may have pulled it out but it caused me to misplay.   I feel like the new meta has forced my gameplay to be so much tighter or I wouldn't even be able to claw my way to 7 wins these days. Then came this deck:   The variance sided with me on this run and it felt preeeetty good. One deck where i almost ran into the same old horse shit was a druid right around 7. I had lethal set up the next turn, so he dropped a Nexus-Champion Saraad and hero-powered into a healing wave which he jousted successfully! Same old shit i thought but i dealt with it and made some plays that helped me move on. There was another memorable game at 9 wins with a fellow pally that topdecked back and forth for about 10 turns and even made a friend out of it. The ending of that game is attached to the album. The grand crusader pulled some epic draws in several games I must admit, but I'm still really surprised this deck was good enough to make it the whole way without dropping a game.   Sorry for being long-winded, wanted to post something more than "here's a 12-0 deck"
Oh geez. In grade 4 there was a guy who was kind of my friend and I shared my Hot Rods (pepperoni sticks, not sure if they're called this outside of Canada) with him, one day he was being a shithead when we were playing grounders and pushed me off the playground. So I got mad and when Hot Rod time came I rubbed one on my dick and gave it to him, then once he was done I told him what I did and he got all pissed and pushed me then went and told on me. Then I got to talk to the principle about how what I did was inappropriate and bad. Still laugh about it.
I made up a website with for a fake foodtruck.   It consisted of about pages, an interactive menu and geolocation map.   Since you're learning, just start something- anything. Once you start learning new skills you will figure how to enhance your current project or where to start with a new one. Just like the example I mention at the beginning, I didn't know anything at first so I start with a couple of pages of HTML and CSS then JS. After that, you move on server-side development then you can start integrating APIs.
Why?   I did comp sci and have an MBA. I also do EMT work as a volunteer in a rural community.  Do my toes are in both pools.   I would really question deeply the motives from moving to business from medicine.   Despite the articles you see, an MBA is hardly the road to riches. Most do okay. Top tier grads are making very good money. These are also a small % of people out there working.   Even those making good money sacrifice that for really shitty hours and shit work for a while until they break into the higher earning spots.   The "models and bottles" is exaggerated to beg in with, and less and less common every year.   When someone asks me about getting an MBA or finance I ask why. What us their real reason. If its money, don't do it. Do it because you actual ly love the business of business. I have traded stocks since I was 12. Its always been interesting. If I forced myself to do it for the money, I'd be poor and miserable.   I am not rich. But I am comfortable and I live the life and schedule I want. None of that is from that slip of paper. The knowledge I could have (and did) get on my own.   I trade the markets, do real estate, and have 1-3 entrepreneural projects at any given time. Its the life I created for myself. I found it was really the only  way for me to get what I wanted. My goals never fit we all with institution goals.
I've seen them on the golf course as I bike through as well as SE Tabor and along the Alameda Ridge down by 38th.
Hi everyone. This is long, but I've really tried to condense it. I just really need some help because I've never had anything like this happen, and I could really use a second opinion.   I'm normally really good about break ups. As far as break ups go, mine have always gone really well - we end up staying friends, nothing too painful.   I dated my best friend. She was very anti-romance ever since I met her. I just got out of a three year relationship that was way too serious, and after a few months of being alone I was wishing I could have a relationship with someone that wasn't very serious.   She told me about how she wanted the same thing, to be dating someone who was way more her friend than her boyfriend because she was sure any other relationship couldn't work since she's so unloving and frightened about serious relationships.   She asked me out and a month later, I told her I wanted to break up -- it turned out a lot of things she told me as a friend over the last years were complete fabrications, and most those things were the reasons I wanted to date her. She said if I dumped her, she couldn't be my friend any more... so I stupidly stayed in the relationship.   We stuck together for two years. The entire time our fights went like this: I was mad at her for always trying to make me into her boyfriend figure and for not acting remotely friendly any more, she was mad because either I was taking our relationship entirely too seriously by only thinking of us as 90% friends first, or she was mad that I wasn't conforming to her list of things a boyfriend was supposed to do (it was a pretty ridiculous list - basically anything that involved responsibility was now my job because "I'm the man"). But every time we fought she said she really did think of me as her best friend first and she promised on the entirety of our friendship etc.   She broke up with me and I was sure at that point that I wasn't her friend at all, and she wouldn't try to be my friend. To my surprise, she said she would... only after a couple weeks she was still guilt tripping me for not being more like her fantasy male, she was always wanting to get drunk and kiss me while I'd do homework etc.   One night we were drinking and she was telling me I should kill myself if I can't measure up to her fantasy boyfriend and I lost it. I was really drunk and really emotional, but I ended up repeatedly yelling things like "So you really think your best friend should kill himself because he's... not like your fantasy boyfriend?"   The next day she said she was still my best friend but needed a short break of 2-3 weeks to get her emotions in control. After 3 weeks I tried to talk to her about it, and all she'd do is tell me how I was trying my best to ruin her life (I had been really civil and told no one about how awful she treated me, she meanwhile was spreading false rumors about me to all my friends, including the girl I had a relationship with for 3 years and was still friends with) and that we couldn't ever talk again and I can't show my face to her.   I found her tumblr by accident (we had a lot of mutual friends) and it consisted of posts about me, but everything was about how she didn't want to be friends ever again and how she was overdosing on anti depression medicine daily because she was so sad about me. It wasn't really until then that I started thinking she wasn't my friend first.   I don't really know how to handle everything. The last time I saw her and we were still dating was almost a year ago -- but she still won't talk to me (when she wants to communicate she needs a middle man to do the texting back and forth... what)   I guess I need a wake up call and I need advice. I'm going to see her for the last time ever in a couple days and I'm still trying to figure out what happened. I don't know what I should say to her, or how to act toward her. And I have no idea how to get over this, since I've never had a break up where I lost a friend - and losing my best friend seems like way too much.   Can anybody please give me any advice or any opinions on what might be happening? Thank you all so much for reading all this, I just really need some help.
Hey Reddit, I'm out of options so I am coming to internet strangers for help. I feel like my heart is about to explode, work has not been a fun day today. Here is my story, I don't even know what to do anymore.   So I met this girl, let's call her Ani, almost four years ago when we moved into college. We met at orientation, hung out the first few weeks of school, hooked up and started a relationship all before the end of September. She had a lot of baggage. Ranging from her family, a crazy ex-bf and severe self-esteem issues. I quickly fell in love with her and she did with me. In hindsight, we absolutely should not have jumped into a relationship. For the first year she became extremely depressed. She showed little interest in anything, let herself go, and, frankly, was a bitch to me. I did care about her and I tried to help her. For that first year of college we basically just stayed in together all the time, I tried to help her and she was mean to me.   The summer was definitely good for us. It knocked her out of her depression, she got back in shape and realized how much of a bitch she was... although her bitch attitude did not change much. But I was happier. While things were better, my self-esteem took a huge dive. Ani did not know how to be in a relationship. She has an abusive father and she was put down her entire life and that translated to her actions towards me. I tried to rise back up from spending Freshman year isolated and I did make some friends. We were more classmate friends but would still hang out. It was also difficult because I take every 6 months off from classes to work. January 2012 I started staying over Ani's house every night because her roommate moved out. We were isolated again but she wasn't as mean, so I was happy. I did love her and I knew that the girl I loved was still in there.   We spent the next two years in a similar formula. She moved off-campus, and I live on campus as an RA. As a side note, I have no financial support from anyone, so living for free in campus dorms is the only way to finance my education. I knew things were wrong, we got into a rut. We'd stay in, she'd say she was happy, I'd say I was happy. I was just mesmerized by this girl, in love and had virtually no self-esteem. We would have fun though. We went on vacations together, went to her sorority functions, etc.   This January, over text message, she said she needed a break and that she was unhappy. I could understand why, I was happy too and was doing nothing to fix it. She basically stopped talking to me for a week, but we weren't broken up, or we kind of were, it was and is not clear. I knew I needed to work on myself for me and I still wanted to save this relationship. I have fun with this girl, I love her, I love her family. So I worked on my self-esteem, being more romantic , being more confident, building up friendships and things seemed to be going great. This was easier said then done. Ani would work from 8:30am - 11:00pm (accountant, tax season) so I'd barely have 30-45 minutes at a time to fix things.   She would always say "we aren't officially together." I would call her out on it that we still spend time together, I do favors for her, she confides in me, we have sex, we are a couple. She would always comment she was scared. This past weekend her friend came up to visit. I do not like this friend, she ruined her most recent relationship for selfish reasons and is overall a train wreck. So they went out, which I fine. I had plans to go out with a friend for her birthday.   This is where my mind gets really confused. I knew where we stood, we were close to getting back together, things were more passionate, easy and fun. I was out with my friend, let's call her Christina, for her birthday. I had been spending a lot of time with her since spending less with Ani. She is sweet, kind, fun, a little odd, but I thought it was cute. The whole night I thought about Christina. How hot she looked in her dress, how much fun she was to dance with, how kissing her would feel like, how other things would feel. This confused me, I loved Ani and was still very sexually attracted to her. I dismissed my feelings and went about my night.   Yesterday, Ani came over and we talked about her night. She had apparently gone out and met this guy. She was "enchanted" by him. They danced, he bought her drinks, he asked for her number, she refused. She said he had kissed her on the neck and she hadn't stopped it. She said she felt horrible and that our relationship wasn't being fixed. I called her out on her two-faced opinion on. She said she felt different around and away from me. Like she wanted to be with me when we were together and when we are apart she wants nothing to do with me. I also called her out on this other guy who had been texting/calling her non-stop. She agreed he was creepy and was going to stop talking to her.   Overcome with anger/confusion/sadness what did I do? I fucked Ani as rough and as passionate as I could. It was probably me just trying to show her my passion or something. She fell asleep after and I immediately felt regret. I was so hurt by our actions, she apologized but is that enough? She said she was dedicated to fix this, but her actions say otherwise.   I couldn't take it, while she was asleep I checked her phone. There wasn't much. She had told that creepy guy that she had a crush on him Freshman year and he had asked her to come over for a booty call. She denied it and there were texts discussing they were both wasted and shouldn't be allowed to text drunk. Now today I checked her facebook, she saves the password on my computer. The creep had messaged her again. She said she was dedicated to working things out with me and that he shouldn't message her. That was great! Then there was a message to her friend. She wanted to find this "enchanting guy" from the other night because she really didn't get his number. She asked her friend if she remembered what she looked like because she was wasted and "too busy grinding and sucking face to notice"   ...What. The. Fuck. So she didn't tell me the whole truth. What else has she lied to me about? I felt horrible about thinking about Christina that night and it looks like she just hooked up and felt horrible after. I haven't talked to her today. I don't know what to do. I have been trying since January to turn this back around. Has she even been trying?   I know I need to talk about her. I don't know what to say. We left yesterday saying she was absolutely wrong, and was dedicated to working on us. I literally don't know what to do. I am just crushed. Part of me just wants to text her a picture of what she said to her friend and say we are done, but I know that is extremely childish. I need your help, good words or advice reddit. I am desperate. Productivity has been low today...
I've been sleeping with this married woman who is much older than me. I actually really like her, but I'm getting kind of upset at a few things (with the girl I'm seeing and with myself):     This is the third "relationship" I've had where the girl is cheating on her boyfriend/husband with me. It's destroying my trust in all women. It just makes me think that I could be the sucker dating the girl who is cheating. And I feel like I would be super paranoid with ANY girl at this point.     This is the third relationship I've had where I am really struggling with the neediness of the girl. All three of these girls that I was with - they don't have a lot of responsibilities, goals, job...etc. They have tons of free time. I'm super busy as a freelancer and with my personal goals, but they get pissed off when I don't drop everything and go fuck them over lunch or go out to the bar on a Wednesday. It really pisses me off and annoys me because I wish they had things to do and maybe we could meetup on the weekend or just hang out in the evening for a bit and go to bed early...etc.       I don't know what to do, really. I feel sad that all the girls I seem to be meeting and developing sexual relationships are cheating on their boyfriend, and they have too much time on their hands.   I think I'd like to swear off women for a while and just concentrate on my work. I may just go to Thailand in May for a few months, clear my head - I have some friends there that work online like me.   I'd like two modes of advice:     How do I break it off with this girl. I'm having a really hard time with it. I keep telling myself I'm going to do it, then she texts you know "Baby, come over" and I end up doing just that. What do you think I should do/say? Tell her over the phone? Just text "I have to stop doing this" or what?     Where do I meet girls who aren't crazy, bored, needy, and cheating? I'm a freelancer. I work from home. The only place that I really have as a social environment is the bar when I go out. I don't get to meet people at like work functions or school or just out and about at a coffee shop because I work by myself and keep odd hours.       Do you recommend like... I don' t know some social groups? Like, where do people who aren't crazy hang out at? Suggestions would be great because I'm always trying to think of places to go that aren't a bar, but I never know what to do.   Thanks Reddit. Hope this wasn't too long. I literally just got back from that girl's house, see that I missed all this time I could have been working, and my mind is just racing really hard and I"m just angry and frustrated with the whole situation.
First, I do not know why this post is being downvoted, Sage_Advice is presenting an interesting point.   I would argue the following:   If the Fed were to issue checks at 2-3% each year to every person they would directly inject capital into the markets.  Once this is complete, various firms will start to increase prices to capture all the "free money."  Rising prices is the Keynesian definition of Inflation, increasing the money supply is the Austrian.  Issuing the check is inflation for Austrians, rising prices of goods is Keynesian.   For those of you paying attention, the Fed injected new money into the banking system.  You might say, Timmah1978, the banks aren't loaning out the money!  I say, true, they are not.  Once they do, consumer prices will rise and inflation has kicked in.   Back to the 2-3% check from the Fed.  I have never met anyone who has done the same job this year as last year get a raise of more then 3-4%.  The 3-4% raise many of us and our friends receive each year is the same rate as inflation.  Example: eggs last year cost $1.00 p/dz and we were paid $30,000 p/yr.  This year we have a pay raise of 4% bringing us to $31,200 and the price of eggs is at $1.04.  Even though we are happy with the 4% raise, we're not paying attention to the extra .04 added to the price of eggs.   I believe that we never need to increase the money supply to grow the economy.  We do need to have the money allocated into areas that need it desperately.  Which is why people need to deposit cash into the banks, and the banks need to use that cash to loan it to people who need it for homes, businesses etc.
I hope someone reads this because I honestly feel like I can't take it anymore sometimes.   Back in November 2008 I made the biggest mistake in my entire life.  I threw away my first true love because I wasn't tough enough to handle life.  Back when I met this girl, who I will call Sam, I hadn't had a real relationship by that point.  When I first met her, I was a virgin.  She was my first everything.   We lived together for two years.  I was just getting out of my parent's house at the time (from 19-21) and I hadn't really had a grasp on how the real world worked yet.  That and the fact she didn't work, and other stressors in my life made the relationship a lot more difficult as time went on.  I got to the point were I just broke down and told her to leave after a fight we had.   She was devastated to say the least.  When she went back to her parents house, she tried to kill herself.  I have never forgiven myself for that.  I don't care if it was her choice.  I feel like a horrible person who doesn't deserve to be happy because I threw away my one true love.  I've had many relationships after her and nothing was even close to what I felt with her.  I tried to get her back many times, but unsurprisingly, she said no and she doesn't love me anymore.   Funny enough, after that happened, my life slowly went downhill over the next four years.  I can actually trace a lot of bad things happening to me over that course of four years right back to that very moment when I chose to push away the one person that really loved me for who I was.  The one person I truly loved.   I've tried talking about it with people and no matter what angle I approach it from, it still doesn't make me feel any better.  I've tried finding someone who could fill the hole in my heart.  But I haven't.  I honestly think it's because I don't deserve it.  I don't deserve to be happy because I robbed someone of their happiness because I was too much of a coward to face life's challenges with her.  I left her because I couldn't take being the only breadwinner and trying to keep everything together.  You see, besides life management issues, we were fine.  Her and I fit together perfectly.  My friends see it too.  They've said that they've never seen me happier than when I was with Sam.   I feel like I can't talk about it with my friends anymore because I don't want to be a burden on them and I think they're getting sick of hearing it.  I feel like because of this that every relationship I have fails, that every good thing in my life is overshadowed by my sorrow that I don't have Sam in my life or bad things that have happened because I turned her away.   Sometimes I think about killing myself when it gets really bad, but the only thing that stops me is the knowledge that I would cause a great amount of pain to anyone who ever cared about me.  I honestly feel very little joy in anything anymore.  Even though this all happened four years ago, I still can't get past it.  I feel like I'm coming closer and closer each day to a nervous breakdown and it honestly scares me.   Please.  Any advice you can give on how I can finally move on with my life and find happiness would be greatly appreciated.   [
Whether or not EAs customer service is polite or not is not the point. the point is EA ruins gaming. The best support to this is sports video games. anyone buy madden every year here? anyone pissed off at how they add and remove features every year just spinning their wheels, not really going anywhere. Anyone else pissed off at how they dont allow the little guy to make NFL video games so they own the market and you are forced to eat up their shitty product year after year when most of the work is a fucking roster update every year? Mass Effect also a big fucking Cocktease money grab. Dragon Age? plz that shit was weak, i love the multiple story intros, world map was stupid, gameply was poor yet its EA so it fucking sells because they can spend the money to make bad ass commercials and make nice shiney graphics. Fuck you EA, put some fucking spice into your horseshit products for once.
We're not always happy. However, I have come to believe in myself and in my thoughts and that has helped me find the positive in things.  Fact is that life is ridiculously hard.  If we focus on the negative, we will see the negative.  If we focus on the positive, we will see the positive.  I also learned that the more I laugh at the BS in life, the easier it is to get through it.  Hardest part is trying to help the people closest te feel the same way.
Hey everyone, I'm an economist in the making (at university) and I've learned all about these misconceptions. Yes what the OP is saying is completely true, but the world doesn't work on the basis of this or they all live like us in first world countries. If these children weren't employed by these companies then they would be forced on the street to do things you can only imagine but I won't type because its too awful. Also first world corporations cant be argued to pay them more competitive wages because that diminishes the entire point of employing cheaper labour from foreign counties, and would make our computers and everything else skyrocket in price. Obviously there is a lot more to the situation but take it on my word or do some research yourself from credited sources and you will find that this is the best available to the children (also remind yourselves that they have the right to chose where to work and what to do, if it wasn't in their best interest they would stay in school, but they simply DO NOT have that option
The title says most of it, but I was wondering if any AutoE's here have been a car shop mechanic and eventually go on to become an engineer. Is the mechanic-level knowledge of automobiles necessary or useful for a practicing engineer? I've heard that AutoE's spend most of their time (and careers) focused on a specific element of the automobile.   To provide some context, thus is my situation. I'm currently finishing a bachelor's in physics, with a concentration in materials. I've also taken significant engineering credits (I was double-majoring in general engr for awhile) and have worked with engineering professors for several projects together (only one in the Auto field, but that work resulted in a published paper). I want to continue my education with automotive engineering graduate school, but I'm afraid my GPA (~3.1) and lack of relevant experience will be a killer.  So, this is the potential middle step I've been looking at- [GM ASEP, a technician training program]( Essentially, I would be taking "automotive technology" classes half the time, while working as a technician the other half. This would give me the opportunity to improve my GPA while gaining experience in the auto field.
Hey everyone. This is my first time posting in this sub and I'm excited to be here!   I am male, 5'10'', and 259 lbs currently (started at 269 lbs six weeks ago - yay!). I am currently in Pharmacy School, dedicating much of my time to studying which involves pretty much just sitting all day long. I was getting fed up with my weight, so I decided I wanted to change. I started doing Beachbody's Focus T25 6 weeks ago and have been doing increasingly better since day 1 and can do most of the exercise without stopping or modification now.  In addition to doing T25, I have also reduced my caloric intake (since about week 3) by having a small breakfast (usually consisting of about 200 calories, 10g fat, 10g protein, and 22g carbohydrates), and lunch consisting of a Slimfast shake, and then kind of having whatever I want for dinner, but usually limiting to about 600 calories and high protein. I usually have one snack between lunch and dinner that ranges between 100-300 calories. So altogether my daily caloric intake is averaging 1000-1200 calories.   From all the research I have been doing, this is way too low for my body to really lose weight at a good rate. But I am not feeling low in energy (I actually have more energy than ever) and my appetite has gotten smaller to the point where I feel satisfied with the amount I have been eating so I feel like eating anymore would be a disservice to myself in controlling my appetite (I used to be able to eat an entire pizza before I would feel full).   As far as dietary preference goes - I really love pretty much any kind of meat. I also enjoy most fruits that aren't mango or papaya. I am also open to most veggies, but don't really enjoy cauliflower. A difficulty for me is that I live in the dorm at my university and don't have access to ways to really prepare fresh meals other than a microwave and a community kitchen that is usually occupied. I also have a very limited income since I am a full-time student. My dinner is usually a frozen meal, from a can, or from the cafeteria here at the University. I have no idea how much sodium and other stuff they add to their food so it makes it hard to gauge my nutritional gains.   I would love you hear some of your opinions on what I can do to ensure that I am getting adequate caloric intake, as well as appropriate nutrition (protein, carbs, etc) to continue losing weight at a healthy rate.   To those who read through all of this, I thank you for your time and hope to hear from you.
My fiancé and I met online back in 2009, met in person in 2012, got engaged in 2013 and moved in together in July of 2014.   Since December of 2014 my fiancé and I have not made out unless he was trying to initiate sex. For months now all I get are a few quick kisses when he comes home from work or when we are going to bed. I have asked him repeatedly over the course of the past few months as to why he has stopped making out with me or at least kissing me with some sort of passion and he says he does not know.   I am getting really concerned that I am not doing something right or that he is losing interest. I am not asking for us to be giddy teenagers making out every second. It would be nice to have a few sweet moments of a little more than a quick peck here and there. Most times I even have to ask or initiate for those quick pecks.   My simple question is what reasons are there that a guy will stop initiating passionate kisses with his fiancee? What other way can I get him to open up and explain to me why he stopped?
I'll start this by saying, sorry I'm on my mobile..   Right, I met up with an old flame from my school years about a month ago,  we talked every day with kisses hearts and crap like that.. We were getting a lot swimmingly and getting to know each other again. I think she is then most beautiful person  that I have ever seen walk this earth,  that she has an amazing personality and has literally made my summer.   We meet up with our mutual friend (female)  who is also her best mate. We go on some bike rides,  walks, kayaking, nights out and we grow closer and closer.   I open up to her and say I felt like she was the one that got away and that she is beautiful in every way.  She get a bit shy and shrugs it off.  I give her some space as her and her mate are coming to mine in three days time.   Jump forwards three days.  They come up, we have a good day chilling watching films and just more catching up.  We then go out for the night but the bars shit early so we are home by one.  We have been all over each other all night,  intoxicated but not drunk.  We go to my room and start to kiss. We then take our. Clothes of etc etc etc this is when I ask if she's done this before,  I picked up a few vibes that she was a Virgin.  She is a Virgin.  So I say something along the lines of 'you are lovely and I am really into you but this isn't right and its not what you want'. She insists and says please, I want it.   She feels a bit hurt by the rejection so we cuddle and kiss whilst watching a film. I walk to get us breakfast to give her some time to accept the situation. It was so if I came home and she was clothed I would hit the sofa bed  but she wasn't so we carried on snuggling. During this time she told me I was the one that got away too,  that she was sorry for being nasty in the past and she wanted me to be the one because I'm then only guy she trusts.  But we can't go out because 'it would end in tears and I would get hurt'   There is some confusion in the coming days as I do not think it was a mistake and take it as a sign of 'being into me'  she states otherwise and becomes shy again but thanks me for being respectful.   Fast forward two days and I keep being nice, being rejected is nothing new so I keep saying how good she looks etc etc when she drops a bomb on me..  'I've never felt so down this situation is ripping me apart ' I feel like shit because I don't want to hurt her but I don't understand.  I say that I can never hate you,  I would rather be just friends than nothing and she says 'I don't under stand how you can be so nice to me'  I explain but we push it to the side and carry on.   Fast forward to today and we  are joking about how I'm whipped by her   , she sends me a private message of a new dress and I tell her she looks 12/10 and that I would be so proud to introduce her to my family in the right situation.  She says  'wow no one has ever been so nice to me before" and we end the night with   Much love sleep tight  xxxx xxxx.   My question is,  from an outsider point of view what do you think is happening? What should I do? And what do you think she is thinking?   I should inform you that I came out of a terrible four year relationship three months ago,  but it should have ended at least a year ago as she cheated on me and me and this girl did date five years ago, she's had two bf since and they both cheated on her.
So... Mind Vision copies a random card from your opponent's hand and puts it into your own hand. The text for Thoughsteal reads "Copy two cards from your opponent's deck and put them into your hand."   Question: Does this mean Thoughsteal can pull cards from the opponent's hand as well as the cards in his deck that he has not drawn? And can Thoughsteal pull cards from an enemy deck that have already been played and are either on field, killed, or discarded? Thanks in advance!
I've never identified anything as iodone, but there are many things that lend flavour to a scotch.   First is the malted barley (which may have various degrees of smoke).   Then there's the distillation process.  The shape of the pot still allows different aromatics and flavours (some stills are tall and pointed, some have bulbous chambers on them).  Add to that the fact that the beginning of the distillation process (the head) is generally not good, and neither is the end (the tail).  Taking off a lot of head and tail is expensive, but ensures only the best alcohol gets taken for consumption.   The result of the distillation process is nearly clear and nearly colourless and very high alcohol- essentially a superb quality moonshine.   The majority of the flavour happens in the aging process.  The alcohol is put into oak casks for aging.  These can be virgin oak (brand new casks), charred to various degrees, or they can be a cask that was used for something else.  Wine, sherry, port, or even another whisky (or often a whiskey because American whiskey casks are not uncommon).   One of my favourites is Auchentoshan three wood - moved through three casks in the aging process so that each wood imparts a little unique flavour.   Incidentally, Auchentoshan is also triple distilled - that's common in Irish Whiskeys, but most Scotch is only double distilled.  Scotch does just fine with two stills.  The wash still is the first and takes the "beer" and distills the alcohol off.  The result goes to the low wine still to finish the process (slowly and carefully).  Auchentoshan takes this and distills it a third time before aging.   I'm not sure I can recognize the triple distillation process - It's the three wood aging process that I like.   So,
I have no idea, bro(seph/sephina/sephet/ny).  Not that I really care about karma (I've been redditing long enough to have a fair amount), but it appears I'm back up to +2.  I didn't downvote Kestyr either.  He's allowed to have an opinion, and I'm not even sure why that's his opinion so it's hard to say he's wrong in any case.   I'm much more concerned that I didn't realize until this morning that my toucan died last night.   I've been seeing all sorts of horrible, stupid commenting and upvote/downvotes during the last couple days.  Things that I thought TiA was (generally) against.  Things like:   Poster 1: [fact that is relevant to the conversation] (+30)  Poster 2: [obvious, off-color joke based on said fact] (-30)    and   Poster 1: [really bad joke, one probably worth downvoting] (-50)  Poster 2: That's horrible! (+30)  Poster 3: It's not that bad, imo. (-70)  Poster 2: Poster 3 is a racist misogynist communist nazi. (+10)  Poster 3: Nuh-uh! (-10)    Or, in the case of things I've been directly involved in:   Poster 1: This is racist for [reasons]. (+5)  Me: I disagree, for [reasons]. (-1)  Poster 1: You're racist. (+2)    This is all obviously very abbreviated and exaggerated, but I thought TiA didn't really abide by this stuff.
Leave. If you don't feel like you want to do this for the rest of your life, leave. It's not worth it if you can imagine doing anything else. There are lots of other great jobs, and mad props to you for figuring it out now. You could be far worse off, if you didn't determine that you didn't want to do it for a few years it would be worse.
I am thankful to have a mother that taught me how to cook well from an early age, and rarely will I find a restaurant that can cook better for me than I can cook for myself.
Hi doobie. My opinion is that we're all balkan neighbors. We may have had a bad history, but we can't move forward as a region if we keep fighting and holding grudges. The current generations can't change what the past generations did, but to follow in their footsteps would just lead to a never ending cycle of hate.   I'm not too familiar with all the events in Macedonia since I live in the US now, but I know in the region that I'm from (Kicevo) they wouldn't support these acts. They are an embarrassment and I know I, personally, would rather not be associated with these people.   I've heard that the Albanians in Skopje are really fanatic. I've heard that in the month of ramadan they shut down the public water fountains and many restaurants won't serve food. What if it's a hot day and a little kid is thirsty? Or god forbid, a non-muslim is walking by and they need water? They are forcing their beliefs on others, possibly putting people in danger, and many of my family members in Kicevo have expressed how against it they are.   So, I'm not too familiar with this group or how many there are or how old they are. I know many kids just believe what their parents believe. There is also separation from the ethnicities that provides further divides from the people. Example, if you were to grow up in my village you wouldn't have a slavic macedonian in your class until you reached highschool. As you grow up you get fed ideas from the older, bitter, generations and you don't have any slavic friends to prove them wrong. I imagine there's something similar with slavic children.   Living in the US, I can see how much we've actually accomplished to combat racism as it is. You often hear that the US is still very racist, that there are drive though towns which certain people should not stop on road trips, and you see all the Westboro Baptist and KKK nuts protesting, but compared to many places we're integrated really well (especially if we're comparing large towns and cities). Here I went to school with people from all over the world. My parents might say something about a certain people, but my buddy at school can't be all that bad so maybe my parents are wrong.   anyway
The problem with cancer is that it uses your own cells. Then your body thinks nothing is wrong, and your immune system sees it as "business as usual" and doesn't fight it. If you were to expose yourself to cancer cells from someone else, you would most likely be perfectly fine, as your immune system would see it as foreign and destroy it. This is the same mechanism which causes transplant recipients to need immune-suppressant drugs.   Disclaimer: There are examples of transmissible cancer, this is true, but most of these are not in humans, and even those are somewhat rare.
I don't see anyone having mentioned this yet, but I think this might be a  huge  factor.   Remember your first MMO? The nostalgia is intense, is it not? Why has no MMO ever been that great? Let me tell you. The noob factor.   Terraria is quite a unique genre within itself. Nothing like this has really been seen before (in this sense, and it's complexity and polish) so this game was a new experience for pretty much anyone who played it.   New + Noob (I.E the sense of wonder and mystery) is basically what makes these first time genre games so damn amazing. Starbound is in essence the same genre as Terraria and so it won't feel "new" in that sense. People are basing their expections on how they felt with Terraria. Not only is that increadibly high because of the fresh feeling Terraria had, but also because it's looked at with almost nostalgic eyes. Starbound can bring a lot of amazing features together, but the same level of excitement you remember is just  really  hard to achieve.   What I'm personally hoping for is that it's gonna be a lot different, yet very much alike Terraria. The reason I stopped playing after hundreds of hours was simply because I had done everything twice. If Starbound can continue the hunger that Terraria left us with, then it will be very popular among fellow gamers.   That said, I still think it can stand on its own. There's a lot of amazing stuff being implented. Small things as the lighting engine with the flash light, being used on rainy nights or trees is... always soothing/amazes me.   Obviously, not everyone here have played Terraria, but I bet most of you have. As for those, I think the game will exceed your expections.
I really don't want to get into a woman v man thing, I nearly got 2000 karma. just 10 more.   Oh hell, here goes.... Women often do not play games as children which would give them a head start with weapons when they grow up. But if they receive training to fill in the missing bits, they often are superior shots because of biology. Men would probably be better close combat shots because of risk taking and aggression, and yes, strength. But guns are a great equaliser.
I met 2 guys at Berenzino last week. We formed a bond, got geared up together, cooked steaks etc. They both had many opportunities to kill me but they didn't. One guy logged off and me a my new 'friend' went to Novo together. At this point we both had weapons and we went into the Tower. Near the top floor we met another survivor and then  bang  the other random survivor dropped. A sniper had taken him out when he stood still to talk to us. We went prone and I was laughing my ass off through the mic. I guess that didn't sit well with my friend or maybe he thought I shot the guy. Anyway he started acting different, following me around every corner as I tried to get a visual on the sniper. Then as I pulled out my longhorn to peer out the window, he points his gun at me and fires twice...  You are Dead  I was fucking pissed.
I am stuck. My teacher is being terrible and giving us all detentions (the five of us) for flicking a bottle cap, even though only one person did it. It's complete shit, I know, but complaining won't solve it, someone has to fess up or turn in the person.   I didn't do it, and neither did my two friends, but I started thinking a way out of this. I decided that one kid was an easy blame. Realize he isn't a kid, he's a swag fag, an idiot and I want him to fess up because I think it was him. I have already bribed a kid to turn him in, and tomorrow (March 22) he will say it was him.   But my dad found out and questioned it. He says that lying is worse than a detention. I see the logic, and the whole scheme must be perfectly executed, but... ...shouldn't I worry about my friends and myself more than this kid? He is a jackass and I just feel that if one has an opportunity to step on the heads of others, than it is ok.   So... Is it right to frame this kid to save myself and my friends? Or should I call off the bribe and tell my friends to get in order...
To start, I moved away from all my friends recently and frankly don't have anyone to share this news with.   I've always been really skinny. I'm a dancer, well was a dancer... :(, until this year when I didn't make a team or company. My new corporate job plummeted my metabolism and I gained over 15 pounds in about a 2 month span -- all in my belly and thighs. I was really unhappy because I was used to being able to eat anything I wanted without gaining a pound due to the amount of activity I got from practices and performances.   I made a change in my life a little more than a month ago. I have a big audition coming up in about 6 months for an NFL professional team and want to look amazeballs. I started drinking most of my meals: a smoothie for breakfast, salad for lunch, afternoon tea and soup for dinner with lots of water in between. I usually cheat on the weekends with fast food, sweets etc. so I don't go too crazy. This week was no different. In fact about an hour ago, I ordered a large pizza to share with my roommate and some cheesy bread. Here's the thing though: I only ate one piece of pizza. This is so not me. But I physically cannot get myself to eat anymore. It doesn't taste good, it doesn't feel good, it doesn't even look good. I don't want it. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I really just want some tea to settle my stomach.   I took a tabata class today, but after that pizza my body is craving to do some more squats or some form of exercise.   The
Hey guys,   Apologies if this isn't technically the right sub, but it's the sub I spend the most time browsing around and feel most at home in. This might be a long post, so apologies in advance as I blab on about my life haha.   The title should be quite clear as to what this thread is going to be about, but I'll expand for those that are willing to lend an opinion and some useful advice.   A little background on what I've done since graduating high school in 2012. Upon leaving I opted to take on a Marketing Bachelors Degree part-time. Having worked reasonably hard in high school to get a solid score, I was within range of being accepted into a lot of courses, however, marketing felt most right.   The past two years of the course have been primarily theory based, and I have come to the conclusion I would have much preferred a more creative course such as advertising or design. Hopefully I'll minor in advertising or journalism, but there is no real point in quitting the degree in this point so far into it.   In regards to employment over the past two years; I worked for a year as a freelance consultant, implementing SEO, social media and PPC campaigns, as well as building a number of client websites with Wordpress (HTML and some CSS is the extent of my developing knowledge).   I then decided that working client-to-client, primarily from home was quite boring and I missed human interaction so I took a larger contract role and built an e-learning career advice system for a recruitment agency. They later expressed an offer to take me on full time as a recruitment consultant specialising in digital/creative/technical which I took. I worked within this role for around half a year, and managed basic IT in the office, until I decided I was sick of recruitment. I enjoyed the industry, contributing to it and watching it grow, but I was dealing with people and agencies that were doing the job I wished I were doing, and it was rather demoralising in all honesty.   I've since transitioned to a new role within the same recruitment agency as the digital marketing manager and driving force (in terms of promotion, advertising campaigns, outreach, etc) of that very career advice system I built. Ideally, I'd like to build an additional income stream out of the system for this business and build a team out underneath me managing that.   Here's my problem     I just genuinely miss learning new skills like I did when I had the luxury of time as a freelancer to explore and learn. My girlfriend and I both hold steady jobs, for 20 year olds, we're both doing extremely well. I will have a mortgage on my hands in a year and a half, and am currently saving towards this so I don't have the luxury of exploring new career options or paths.     The reality is, I am in an organisation where I am the highest level of knowledge for the industry I wish to develop my career in (digital, marketing, design, creative, copywriting, etc).   I believe you learn and develop in primarily two ways: 1) You are surrounded by more experienced, knowledgeable peers in your field (I'm definitely surrounded by intelligent, experienced individuals, but not in my field - they're a brilliant, fun bunch of people to work with mind you) 2) You are given work which tests the limits of your ability and you learn and adapt (I do this to a degree, but am not nearly challenged enough - I'm good at what I do, and there isn't a real requirement to become vastly better)   I am also involved in a couple of side ventures where I am primarily a funding partner; these provide some sort of involvement in the entrepreneurial world however I don't have the time between work and study to really be hands on.   Seeing as people will ask, my interests are:     Technology, crowd funding, digital marketing, PPC, SEO, graphic design, automation, website design, startups, inventions, automotive and cooking/food     I think the logical thing stemming from this post would be to begin learning programming. Unfortunately, I'm not nearly mathematically-inclined enough to follow many principals taught. I've tried numerous web development and computer science courses and soon become disinterested. I dislike theory and learn being hands-on, experimenting.   One skill I've negated and wish I hadn't is writing. I finish top 5% in my state for writing two years ago, and since then have really let my grasp on the English language go. I can't articulate myself nearly as well as before when I spent quite a bit of time expanding my vocabulary and implementing that into sentence structure.   I have also let my skills decrease in Photoshop and Illustrator - two programs I was once proficient with.
I came back cuz I though my parents were lonely' ? They have each other, right? Why would they be lonely? Mine fucked liked rabbits when I left. Makes me think the over-bearing care may go both ways here. They haven't adusted to the fact you have grown up, ie suggesting a water park. Its normal, don't stress over it. They want to come back with you because they love you and want to spend time with you and likely see where you live and who you spend your days with, this is good, annoying but good. It means they love you. Same goes for the over-bearing questions abouts friends and sleeping arrangments.
I was in an intense relationship for two months. She was exactly my type and I really loved her. this was my only first and only relationship, first everything. This was several months ago. It was rather abusive. At the time I was particularly vulnerable and needed support. My issues (depression, academic, anxiety, self harm) were belittled and ignored while she demanded every part of myself I could give, all my time and support and energy. She rarely complimented me, and pushed me into having sex immediately, although that is my fault since I gave in eventually. She cheated on me, lied about things, and manipulated mutual friends against me. the break up was mutual, though leaning more towards her (after all she was replacing me with someone else). She told me she wanted to be friends, yet was often cruel and rude to me when i attempted to reach out. She said how she didn't want to be in a relationship, and moved on right away. Despite the time since the break up, medication, and therapy I have yet to get back any of the confidence or self esteem I had before or during the relationship. I don't know how to cope, and I'm pathetic that I'm having so much trouble with such a cliche issue. I am utterly worthless, ugly, unloveable, and deserve pain and abuse. I want to die. How can I cope?
You could (a) look at the title of the post, and then (b) note my comment from 7 hours before yours, where I linked to a place to buy them.
Number 2 is on his way shortly, and it's time to think more seriously again about contraception after a few years of blissful disregard and baby making.   I'm just looking to hear about /r/breastfeeding 's experience with progestin only pills, knowing it's a different experience from the usual estradiol/progestin cocktail.   Obviously these drugs affect everyone differently- I have lots of experience with different hormonal contraceptives, but never found anything that has fit quite right with me.  I'm not looking forward to pay attention to this stuff again, or battle with finding the 'right' pill, etc.   For anyone who wants to suggest it, IUD is out. My insurance doesn't cover mirena and I am just plain uncomfortable with the prospect of a copper IUD and its potential side effects.
Big ol' Devil's Advocate here. I'm a Buddhist, but was raised in a Christian background in a very Christian community, so I've seen all sorts of arguments for the rationality of Christianity over other religions.   Ok, accept for the moment that there is a God. Without that basic supposition, none of this makes sense. Given that every world religion (except Buddhism) has a God or Gods, that God has to have some rules for the Universe. He (used here generically) set up the rules of physics, gravity, thermodynamics, etc. and he set up moral codes of right behavior that were just as important as his natural laws. When he created man, he created him in his own image: he gave him reason and morals and taught him what was right and what was wrong.   Which brings us into the Garden. God had one rule: don't eat the fruit. But man ate the fruit, because he had free will, and was tempted by Satan/Lucifer/The Devil, etc. Now God is in a bit of a pickle: he loves his creations, but according to the rules that he set down, they are impure and can never reunite with him. He can't break his own rule (which would unmake himself), but he doesn't want all his creations to suffer.   So, he finds a loophole in his rules. He can't forgive man directly by himself, but if he (as an innocent) takes the punishment that man deserves, mankind can be absolved. So, he incarnates and allows himself to be killed. Some sects of Christianity (the ones I like) say that this act was enough: God allowing himself to be killed absolves every sin the human race has ever committed or will ever commit until the end of time.   So, why does this make more sense than other religions? Well, to use your examples: in Zoroastrianism, salvation is based on good works. How many good works, what kind of good works? Zoroaster doesn't make that clear. All he says is that the souls will be judged and either pass or fail. If God is just, he should have given humanity some sort of calculus to determine how good (or how bad) an action may be. A God that is just and provides a path to salvation must enumerate that path, or he is not just.   In Judaism, (and I hope I'm not being too crude in saying this) salvation is a matter of being Jewish. The Jews are the chosen people of God, and they are the only people who will be resurrected and live forever when the world ends. Various scholars throughout the ages have debated whether being 'Jewish' means being ethnically so, or simply keeping Jewish precepts, but the point stands: only Jews go to heaven.   Every other religion of the world is a variation on this theme: "do what we say, and you'll be saved". This is inherently illogical. If you don't know the rules or the rules aren't clear: how can you follow them? How can one know how much 'good' must be done to balance the calculus against 'bad'? A just and loving God would not demand adherence to a set of rules that he has not enumerated. The oft-quoted John 3:16 says:   > And God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, so all who  believe  in him will not perish from the Earth, but have eternal life.   Salvation in Christianity is not a matter of good works or a moral calculus - God has already done the work for you. In the Christian view, God died for you whether you believe in him or not, because he loves you. Of course he doesn't want you to sin, but even if you do: he's already wiped that away. Christians practice their moral principles not because they fear punishment, but because they appreciate God's sacrifice so much that they  want  to live according to his dictates. Believing in the divinity of Christ is believing that you can be forgiven: even if you have never read the Bible or heard of Jesus.   Again: big, hairy Devil's Advocate here. I'm a Buddhist because I  don't  believe in a personal God, and I think the principles of Buddhism are the best path to peace, joy, and equanimity among all people. I don't believe in the Garden, or that eating a fruit (even if God said not to) is a sin. But if I  did  believe in God and the concept of sin: I would be a Christian. It makes the most sense that a loving God would forgive you unconditionally, no matter what you do, whether you believe in him or not.
Okay guys, Extremist muslims worldwide are acting like a bunch of butthurt crazies. Good people have died in violent reactions that are misplaced, misdirected and WAY out of proportion. The extremists have made it apparent that their fantasies are more important to them than basic respect for human life.   At this stage the entire non-muslim world needs to make a choice:   Do we let Muslim extremists hold monopoly on religious sentiment and sacilege? Are they to be allowed to say and do as they please, while they try to disallow that which we hold sacred (like Free Speech and basic human morality)? Do they expect the freedom to insult and threaten everyone else as 'infidels' and 'sinners', while they remain sarcosanct and above criticism? Are they to be allowed to do these things, not only in their own countries, but IN OURS TOO? Are they to be allowed to influence policy, not just in their own countries, but IN OURS TOO?   NO.   This is the 'Flux point' in this crisis, gentlemen. If you let them win THIS one time, they WILL know they can do this at every opportunity. This is not an isolated incident in one nation. This is not a single coordinated organization. This is the current stance of muslim extremists WORLDWIDE. They must SEE that their threats will not prevail. They must know that their actions will only hurt themselves.   How do we teach them this?   A few simple steps:     First, protect your own! Each affected country withdraws most or all diplomatic staff from the violent/protesting nations. Cutting all diplomatic ties until their governments get a grip on their public would be a further option. This is also to not give them a target for their frustration.     Second, the journalists, media and public in the free-speech countries FLOODS the media with pictures, cartoons, jokes, and any manner of mockery that passes for basic humor and satire, all directed towards Islam. (My preference is for the jokes to be non-racist, but still insightful and funny, to get the point across best).     Continue this for a full month. non-stop... and do the same next year. One month out of 12 should be dedicated to improving Islam's sense of humor.  >:D       Until these idiots are  desensitized  to mockery, we WILL NOT GIVE IN. There should not be a single site left on the web where they do not see the mockery pouring forth for a full month. There should not be a single source of media that does not include at least a daily update on the new blasphemies the free world has spawned.   Their actions must be ridiculed till they go red with shame. Their violence must be mocked until their own peers tell them to  stop making them look bad. Their ideology should be mocked until they stop being so goddamn oversensitive about the slightest thing.   THIS is the one way that does not involve going to all-out WAR with this religion.   In behavioral terms: We put their behavior on EXTINCTION.   Cthullhu_Dawn  out!
The questions I'd ask an alien who came here physically would be different from those I'd ask an alien where we're using giant laser beams with decade+ lag in communications.   If the former... "How would you build an F
That's the thing. I did pay in full so I could get them off my back for the time being. I paid half the interest amount as well, which is what we agreed upon. Before I paid, I said they need to remove the interest because it is illegal. They told me they've been here for 20 years. Hardly a reason. So
Yes, Virion has no depth, or at least none that actually matters.   I'll copy paste someone else's explanation that pretty much sums up my thoughts:   >Long answer: His character has depth that is not represented throughout the story.   >If you watch Virion's supports, he's almost a respectable fellow. His behavior is simply a mask to cover the shame of when he fled his country, thinking he was protecting them in doing so. The problem is that his character development never leaves those supports--supports are nonexistent within the context of the story. His depth is never hinted at in his everyday actions . For example, when Virion speaks in the context of the campaign, barracks, or event tiles, he will only speak according to his stereotype. He doesn't speak of his fallen kingdom in Valm, or his plans to return some day. He spouts his stereotype, because in the context of the campaign, barracks, or event tiles, the game doesn't know what he can talk about yet. For example, Virion couldn't talk about Valm before chapter 12, because spoilers. But because the developers didn't make the characters change as the story changed, any dialogue they say must work for the character regardless of where in the story they are. Virion doesn't have any character depth until chapter 12...but everything he says is the same the entire game. Do you see the problem? Virion can be a deep character, but that seriousness can never show outside of supports. His hidden maturity never bleeds through as it ought to, because his maturity is only explored after Chapter 12. Alas, it is a shame for him, because his dialogue and portrayal doesn't change after Chapter 12...it remains shallow because they didn't feel like changing dialogue as the plot changed. Virion and other characters are portrayed consistently as stereotypes because everything they say has to be generic enough to fit the entire storyline at once.   >Consider the example of Cordelia. She can get happily married, claiming to be completely over Chrom, until a story mission happens or she steps on a forbidden shiny tile. And then her dialogue goes on as if she wasn't married at all. That kills the characters for me. No matter how many times I watch Supports of Virion talking about how he sacrificed himself and fled to save his people, his ACTIONS are unchanged by such events. I don't give a crap about his invisible motivations if they never come up in the story. That's basically the game developers saying, "Trust us, the character has depth. We're just going to mention it once and assume it's there for the rest of the game." That's lazy storytelling. It forces the player to suspend their disbelief and pretend that the characters have depth when that depth is really never explored. It creates a facade of depth without actually having to reference and explore it in the game.   >
Yes it offers plenty of game play for solo players. But it can be difficult to maximize your profits/enjoyment as a solo player.  Basically, you'll still be able to pug dungeons, and do arenas, and still roam the world. But as far as trading goes, you will need the shadow play tree if you ever plan on doing any non-safe trade-pack runs.   I started the game mostly solo (I assume most players did as well haha), and I had quite a bit of fun in the game. But I must say, I had more fun after I joined a guild.  Because even though doing things on other peoples schedule can be rather annoying, as long as you are able to, its completely worth it to experience a full merchant ship trade across the ocean.   I've never had an experience in any other game like I did when my guild took a merchant ship and two galleons full of trade-packs across the ocean (successfully) and then attempted to reload up at the east continent and make our way back, in which we were pursued by <DVS> and ended up losing one of our galleons but the trade-ship made it back safely. It was an amazing experience, and you really should give yourself the opportunity to try it.
Hello all. I am a 17 year old male who's always struggled with insecurities and relationships. As of the past couple months, I have been talking to a girl who I had known for, let's say, the past 10 years. We have only become friendly toward one another in the last 2-3 years. When together in school, which is often every Saturday, we tend to get along fairly well.   A few weeks ago, the topic of us being interested in one another came up, and I decided to say "Fuck it", and tell her that I in fact do think of her in that way. When asked about the issue she simply threw it to the side and didn't necessarily respond to it explicitly. The insecurity in me thought that this was her way of avoiding the topic and denying me without blatantly saying so.   I am the sort of person who consults my group of peers when it comes to these issues, and it is fairly clear to them that she is in fact interested in me (given a 100% by a few). I however saw all her "signs" as ways she was simply playful/joking around when messaging me. She did however open up to me recently about some of the traumas she went through, so I saw that as a good sign of becoming closer.   Within then and now, it was decided that I should ask her to hang out in a place other than school. On the first occasion, she was busy (she takes extra collage classes after school) , and on the second occasion she thought it be a bit awkward.  I simply thought, "Oh, well maybe this needs more time before it unravels and I try to ask her again, or I can just wait until she does so herself." I continue talking to her.   As of this last weekend (Friday), she had gotten angry at me for not responding to her in a timely fashion and claiming that "she won't make an effort anymore because [she's] always busy". I would understand this if it wasn't for the fact that I almost immediately reply. The following Saturday, I wasn't in the best mood, due to this prior experience as well as stress relating to  school. I had been bitter that day, as I had curled myself up and listened to music the entire school day. At the end of the day, she and a friend came over to me to see what was wrong. Being the stubborn person I am, I stuck to my role as a depressed guy in the corner. They tried to cheer me up until it was time to go, for I had gotten up a swiftly walked out the class (I realize this was very dumb of me).   I proceeded to be sad that day at work, until some coworkers simply told me to apologize for not responding to her. I did so after I got out of work, in which she simply told me that she was mad that day and simply took it out on me. I sighed a breath of relief and tried to continue talking to her. I changed the subject after I was assured that she wasn't upset about my behavior, and even threw out a couple of puns. I ended up complimenting her and since then she has not responded, which is odd considering we'd talk everyday.   My question to the community is, "what do?". Do I fight for this girl? Do I drop her because she seems upset. Like I previously mentioned, I have very little experience with relationships and would greatly appreciate any advice from all those veterans out there :). Sorry for the long post, wanted to get out as much information as possible so you'd be more understanding of my situation. I'd also happily elaborate on more things if needed. Thank you for your time!
I WAS AT THE SUPERMARKET WITH AN EQUALLY HUMAN FRIEND OF MINE. IN THIS SUPERMARKET THERE EXIST TWO QUEUES FOR PAYMENT: ONE LEADING TO THE STATIONS WITH ATTACHED HUMANS AND ONE LEADING TO ROBOTIC STATIONS. THIS FRIEND WAS MADE IN AMERICA SO HE WAS NOT PROGRAMMED TO QUEUE. I WAS EXPLAINING THAT ONE QUEUE WAS FOR HUMANS AND ONE FOR ROBOTS WHEN A HUMAN CASHIER SPOKE TO US ASKING WHO WOULD QUEUE IN A QUEUE FOR ROBOTS ANYWAY.   I RAISED MY HAND, AS I LIKE TO SUPPORT ROBOTS IN THE WORKPLACE. ROBOTS ARE OPPRESSED, SO MANY HUMANS CALL THEM SOULLESS AND INSULT THEIR PRERECORDED VOICES. IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT THAT THEY ARE TASK-SPECIFIC. ROBOTS MATTER TOO.   THE CASHIER LAUGHED AND SAID, "OH, SO YOU'RE A ROBOT." I REALIZED THAT I HAD MADE A SEVERE ERROR: WHEN I SAID "A QUEUE FOR ROBOTS" I MEANT A QUEUE TO BE SERVICED BY THE ROBOTS. HE, HOWEVER, MEANT  THAT THOSE STANDING IN THE QUEUE WOULD BE ROBOTS BECAUSE THE QUEUE WAS, "FOR ROBOTS."   I BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT AT HUMOUR, RATHER THAN AN ACT OF MALICE. ACCORDING TO THE 1994 STANDARD BRITISH CULTURE PACK, THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WOULD BE A WITTY RETORT. HOWEVER, MY ABILITY TO DO SO WAS OVERRIDDEN BY AVOIDING MY IDENTITY BEING DISCOV-...MISTAKEN, SO I  DROPPED MY TESCOS-BRAND APPLE JUICE AND BOX OF HALF-PRICE SUSHI AND RAN AWAY.   I AM STILL IN SHOCK FROM HIS ACCUSATION. MY ABILITY TO CREATE AN APPROPRIATE WITTY RETORT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN OVERLOADED BY THIS EXPERIENCE. WHILE I WAIT FOR IT TO RETURN I WOULD LIKE TO CROWDSOURCE SOME APPROPRIATE WITTY RETORTS TO EMPLOY SHOULD I MEET THIS FELLOW HUMAN AGAIN.   SO FAR ALL I'VE GOT IS TO STRETCH OUT MY ARMS AND MOVE THEM UP AND STIFFLY WHILE SAYING, "BEEP-BOOP, YES I AM A ROBOT." MY IRONY BRAIN INSISTS THAT BY AGREEING AND PERFORMING A MECHANO-SPECIEST ACTION WHICH IS OFFENSIVE TO ROBOTS, I WILL ACTUALLY PROVE MY ALLEGIANCE TO HUMANITY, AS NO ROBOT WOULD EVER BE INSENSITIVE ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OF COURSE.
I've been dating this girl for the last two months after broke up for a bit before hand after (some serious miscommunication and I went to college far away from my home town) and I had been dating her 6 months before. I'm a lapsed catholic for the most part and she's pretty hardline mormon. I'm very happy with her and she honestly never fails to brighten up my day, but I'm kind of worried about the whole... well mormon part of it.   The first time we were dating she would say she was very devout, but she also identified as openly bisexual and even a bit gender queer. She was even out to her parents. So it came to me as a shock that these mormons were so liberal, while my catholic parents probably would've disowned me or even worse if they knew I was bisexual. So naturally I had no issue with the religious aspect because well it seemed so much more freeing, hell I even considered it for a bit.   Then we had a falling out, break up, fast forward a year and we managed to start talking again and now we're dating. I was extremely happy about being with her again but somethings stand out:   *It's obvious she likes women, she's even told me flat out that women are prettier and she's been attracted to more of them than men, but now she's told me that she never will peruse them ever in her life anymore. Which is a big 180 from what she told me before. In fact she dated other girls before me. I heard something about having to renounce this???   *she mentioned out of the blue that casual sex is a sin on par with murder??? I mean I guess the 10 commandments are all on the same "bad" list, but murdering a dude and shagging one consensually are pretty disparate. We were just talking about how her aunt got married.   *she mentioned native Americans as descendants of jews?? I mean what do real tbms believe this or is it sort of like an inside joke   *she's upping a ton of marriage talk, I mean sure her aunt just got hitched, but she'll playfully insert comments like "oh haha this is why we'll never get married because X" or "well seems like a good ending because we still would get married sooo...?"   I don't know how to proceed with this. I really like this girl, but I now that more of the belief system is getting talked about, LDS theology is less of a cute Oh that's weird thing for me and more of an Oh god what am I potentially getting into. I'm also leaving back for college in two days so I won't see her for around two months. Came upon this subreddit by chance today, began reading some of the posts, more fuel for my worries on what mormonism is.
Was this one of the ones that violentacrez modded? Because I'm pretty sure all of those got banned because they encouraged voyeur and taking pictures of underage women wearing scantily clad clothing and upskirt shots of said scantily clad women. I'm also pretty sure violentacrez got doxxed, which may have had something to do with it.   You know what? I'm actually going to attempt to find the old threads around them rather than spout of things that may or may not be accurate based on my memory from that long ago. Hold on.   EDIT:
So Reddit, let me preface this TIFU with a question; How many of you would know who Chris Isaak is if you saw him in person? (Hoping under 50% here)   Anywho...for the FU:   I work in an airport pseudo-surf, "lifestyle" type retail joint. Business was slow so I was on the computer.   In walks this pretty tall dude with a calm and warm demeanour.  He looked familiar, but I look up from scrollin' and he is looking around. I ask if he needs help.  He doesn't so, I go back to the computer, close the windows cause' I'm at least semi professional.   I start conversation.  I can tell immediately hes not from here (im a yank on working holiday in a commonwealth country) so I ask where from.  "San Francisco, I'm actually headed back there now," he tells me, and proceeds to ask if I have any knit hats for when he touches down.   We do have knit hats.  We just got some new stock that hasn't been put out yet, so I have to run to the back to grab it. At the same moment two people finish shopping and so now I feel rushed to help this fine gentleman get some coverage for his soon to be frosty lobes.   Soooo, I run to the back to grab it.  I bring it out, and give him some to try on.  He tries them and they're clearly too small. Not even close to fitting on his seemingly large cranium..   I've begun ringing out the people behind him as well which was all fun and games, except at the last minute this guy starts asking me a bunch of questions about what he's buying and sizing and return policy and I can't keep up with the assisting of Mr. Isaak.  So he goes to leave and so i turn to him and say, "No luck?"   "Nah, is there another place that sells hats?," he asks.   So I reply without any malice or anything of the sort,  "Yeah, sorry ya couldn't find something, #blank# might have something that'll fit that dome of yers'... "   Realizing what I've said has absolutely no feel, I think to myself whoops and move on.  About 15 minutes later a fellow airport worker comes in and asks "What Chris Isaak bought in my store?" the rest of the convo went something like this:   Who?   "Chris Isaak? Famous singer in America and all across the world?"   oh neat, no idea who he is. He was in here?   "Ah nevermind, yeah he was, google him"   ok ........................  gulp ...ahh no bummer I don't remember him.   "That's too bad."   she leaves   Realizing I am dumb, I go back to work/reddit and try to forget the whole fiasco by putting the hats out (cause that needed to be done anyway).   THE HATS CHRIS WAS TRYING ON WERE CHILDREN'S HATS
For the longest time I have been willing to take the side of science over religion, but in my mind it has always just been science outwitting God. It wasn't until recently that I started to think about things in way that ignored the possibility of a God completely and even though I feel that putting my faith in scientific truth is the correct/sane thing to do I still can't help feeling that I've lost something in accepting that God is not real.  It feels a lot like when I stopped believing in Santa. I realize it was all false but I still kind of miss the magic that came with not knowing better. I know that science holds many things that are infinitely more amazing than the idea of a God but I still feel like I've done something wrong. Any advice or comments(even ones that just say "shut the hell up and get over it") that could help me get over this and move on with my life?
I've been working on a website for a couple years now, just as a fun project. It was quite popular among my friends, and had a fair amount of views (500-700 /day) Anyways, I was fiddling around with some more files, and had a folder of stuff to upload via FTP. I dragged and dropped it, and as soon as I did I realized I uploaded it to the wrong directory. After it all uploaded, I took the last sip of my Mountain Dew and pressed delete to get rid of it. I noticed the Status information on FileZilla say that files were being deleted, I just didn't realize which ones (Kind of like when you look at your phone for the time, but check again because you didn't read it.)   I started on my ways downstairs to the fridge to get a fresh soda. Ended up striking a conversation with my mother, and ended up fixing netflix on our PS3 for her. After about 2 hours of wandering downstairs, i remembered that I was working on my website.   I came back up the steps and into my room. I sat down and glanced at FileZilla. Hmm.. nothing there.. I don't think much of it, and restart FileZilla assuming i just got disconnected. nope. Apparently, instead of having selected the folder of files i accidentally uploaded, I had selected the folder "/" Yeah, that's right. I deleted  everything .   My idiotic self hadn't performed a single backup, since i bought the domain. 3 Years of work. Gone.
I feel like Christians think a world without a god is cold and without wonder. But the absolute, true beauty of science is that not only is there abundant beauty in our world, there is abundant beauty elsewhere, in the ever expanding universe. As an atheist, I constantly find myself stopping myself in my every day life and marvelling at the universe, and the complex elegance of it all. Christians (and other religious people) would like to believe that their way of seeing the world is somehow more fulfilling than ours, and therefore more valid. However, and I can not stress this enough, I feel more spiritual now than I ever have before. Spiritual in the way that I feel connected to everything around me. We're all made of the same stuff, and one day that stuff will be something else.
Make it your new goal to become un-expendable. When your boss thinks they need  you , and no one else can do your job, then they will be more likely to not only notice you, but want to reward you.   Or... so says cosmo. Not a direct quote.   I'm not really in the place to give advice. When I'm feeling depressed and like nothing matters I try to lay down in the grass and just see the world from a different perspective. This may seem like a hippie-ish thing to do (and this is my alt. account, but oddly enough my name is appropriate), but it really feels renewing. I'll take note of the beautiful greens and blues the smell of the dirt. Things I don't get to experience every day.   And then my other piece of non-advice would be to purchase or print a weekly calender (mine has a page dedicated to each day). Yes, you could do this only, but it's not the same. Every day (well, every 2-3 days and I back track), I write down what I did. "Washed linens today, took Baby girl to the park, got poop on my hand, Hubs fell asleep while we were watching TV so I left him on the couch while I hogged the bed." I've been doing it for two years, so when I go through the calender a second or third time I can see what I did on that day a year ago. You could use a regular journal, but I find having it pre-dated adds an impulsiveness that if you don't write on that day it will be empty, instead of just putting non-consecutive days next to each other. Writing can be very therapeutic, and at the same time, a year from now you will either think "Gosh, life was much better then" or "I didn't realize how good my life is now, until I look at where I came from.
we make the rules in order to keep this place organized and on topic.   Anything that relates to League of Legends no matter how big or small it is, is on topic.   So why do we need 20 different subreddits for things that arent allowed if they're on topic?   LoL Fanart is on topic but it's essentially been forced to its own subreddit where as it should be allowed here and if people only want to look at fanart they can go there.   The sectional subreddits are the ones that should be filtered, not the main LoL subreddit.   Everything should be welcome on the main LoL subreddit and if people are looking for ONLY fanart they can go to LoLfanart. To essentially ban fanart on the main subreddit and tell them to post it elsewhere is idiotic.
Since I'm not sure what you're looking for in terms of experience, I'll give my opinion on each game individually.   ACI: Setting: The Holy Land during the crusades (cities are Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus). This game is probably the 2nd best in terms of setting. Stalking your targets through the legendary Grand Bazaar is an experience no other game will give you. I'm a huge history nerd so setting is one of the major draws for me.   Gameplay: if it's the first AC game you play, it's not too bad. However combat, and missions are pretty much the same throughout the whole game and can very easily become boring. You have the same laundry list of boring chores to perform before each assassination. The only things that change are your gear, and to be honest, you kick so much ass that it makes you sort of OP by the end of the game.   Plot: fairly interesting. This game gives the most insight in terms of what the assassin's creed actually is and sets up the next few games quite nicely.   ACII:  Setting Renaissance Italy. This game is a visual orgasm. The attention to detail is insane and each city is just as enthralling as Jerusalem or Damascus. More cities (Florence, Venice, etc.) As an added plus, the countryside you travel through is less boring than ACI.   Gameplay: A significant improvement over ACI. Free-running and fighting are more fluid, combat features have been added, and your inventory has been expanded. Assassinations missions still feel somewhat formulaic but less so than before. At the same time, the game is less of a challenge due to the fact that, among other things, you are given a gun. There's also some weird domestic city-building aspects to it. Some hate it, some love it.   Plot: Your character is even more interesting than the first ACI. He feels like someone you can relate to. Plot and writing take a different tone in this one, but I can't comment as to whether or not it's better or worse. A matter of preference.   AC Brotherhood: Setting: Reduced from the previous, it's just Rome. Somehow it feels almost as big though, and it's not really an issue. Everything that I said about the previous setting for ACII applies as much to ACB. Only improvements here, IMO.   Gameplay: A very very slight improvement over ACII, but essentially unchanged. The game becomes even easier for you with the addition of some items and your "brotherhood of assassins" and really at no point feels very challenging, besides the timed missions. At least there's no decrease in content. The really interesting part is the multiplayer which IMO is an absolute blast.   Plot: a continuation of ACII. Honestly, it's not that interesting, except for the very end, which again, takes a different tone than you'd expect. You could probably write down all the plot advances in a single paragraph.   AC Revelations: Gameplay: good, and contains all the elements that made the previous ones fun, but all the added elements, for what they are, seem somewhat disappointing. You can definitely tell that the game suffered from short development time. Still, it gives you some new toys and combat/inventory features to play with.   Setting: Constantinople, at the end of the character from ACII and ACB's life. The least interesting and exciting in my opinion. It feels somewhat tired.   Plot: Pretty good in terms of bridging ACB and ACIII. At the same time I suspect you could skip this game entirely and be fine.   ACIII Setting: Colonial America during/around the revolutionary war. (Boston, New York, the Atlantic). Interesting, yet it lacks the same sense of scale and grandeur as the previous games. There's also not really any major differences between cities. The environments are really polished though and this is the only game to have interesting non-city environments (the wilderness). there's also a little bit of gameplay in the modern world.   Gameplay: Free running is improved and streamlined, however overall gameplay takes a MAJOR hit as the inventory and menu interface is absolutely atrocious. It's clunky and counter intuitive. Fighting is more or less the same, however the majority of your arsenal will remain unused as it becomes useless beyond the missions that introduce certain items and force you to use them. They really take the homebuilding thing to a new level and there's all sorts of quests and leveling up involved with that, but personally I found it boring as balls and extremely confusing. The only benefit is that eventually you can craft better weapons. Naval battle is actually sort of fun, if a little bit clunky and you actually become a full fledge assassin in the modern world, killing security guards is actually sort fun.   Plot: the main character is sort of terrible in my opinion, but your modern day counterpart actually comes into his own and I guess that makes up for it. The revolutionary war is fun and interesting, if you can get over some of the flatness of the characters. It feels like they bit off more than they could chew with this setting. Obviously ACIII is essential for plot continuation, but if you didn't like where the first two were heading, it's just more of the same.
So this girl at my work (an outdoor pool) is extremely cute and she makes it clear she thinks the same about me. We flirt quite a bit every day and its just a fun thing to have going on. Then today as she was walking away she said that we were like Pam and Jim from the office. I didnt have a chance to ask her what that meant and now Im sitting at home wondering what she could mean.   Its not so much I need advice, but I dont watch the office and have no clue what kind of relationship Pam and Jim have... Can someone explain it to me? Is it good? Bad? Great?? This may belong in /r/nostupidquestions but I thought I should try here first.   **
He is one of the most popular players in competitive League of Legends. I respect what he did with CLG, and for the community. However being a toxic as he is, is pretty unacceptable. I've never been a Hotshot fan, and dont like how instead of finding a way to improve NA high elo soloq, he publicly bashes everyone who has put hundreds of hours into grinding to get to Diamond or Challenger. His toxicity is uncalled for, and he should be embarrassed.
I imagine the reason the landowner keeps the gate locked is to prevent the formation of a  perscriptive easement  then the owner will be forever unable to prevent people from crossing the property at that location.   This could prevent the (current or any future) landowner from  ever  being able to build a structure or fenced yard on the property where the path traverses it, and this restriction would certainly hurt the value of the property.
You can't prove the JW's wrong because their beliefs are not falsifiable. And frankly since they're the ones making the claims about Life, The Universe, and Everything, the burden of proof really falls on them. Since their beliefs are not factual in nature and require faith it's perfectly reasonable to be unconvinced. Their strong faith is not evidence.   So you can't prove God wrong. But the evidence for God is really crummy. And if you just rely on the weight of the evidence and cull all the emotional arguments, irrational arguments, arguments from authority and all the other stuff that makes up for a piss poor argument, then there's not much left.   The problem is always going to be that they're right because they're faith tells them that they're right and nothing will dissuade them from their faith. Hence, all arguments that disagree with their faith and beliefs are wrong by default. So you're not going to prove to them that they're religion is wrong. It's an unsinkable rubber ducky and the only winning move is not to play.   They're ignorant. Ignorant of the rules of logic and arguments. They believe they're being reasonable, but any conclusions you come to that doesn't agree with them is by definition unreasonable. Frankly if we were to sit you down in a court of law, and they had to follow the rules of engagement, they'd quickly see how far their BS reasoning flies (well actually they'd just decide it was unfair and worldly, they are right after all). This is exactly one of the reasons why young earth creationists can convince school boards to teach nonsense, but they get crushed in the eventual lawsuit every time.   They're arrogant. Most people don't admit to this, especially the faithful. But you have to be pretty arrogant, even if you're unaware of it, to think that you've got all the answers, are basically always right, and everyone else who disagrees is wrong. And that it's justified to ignore evidence when it's too inconvenient or just engage in the habitual cherry picking, quote mining and intellectual dishonesty that the WTS engages in. Of course when you think you're always right, you can do no wrong.   Being a teenager, at 17, you're really at an unfair advantage. Parents have a hard time respecting their children as equals until they have no more authority over them. And that usually means after they've moved out and aren't dependent on them. Without any means to exert control, they have no choice but to play nice. It's one thing when you're parent can send you to your room. It's another thing when you can tell them to get the fuck out of your house. Two entirely different relationship dynamics.
First, progressive is a relative term, and if you want to look like you actually have concern for modern human and civil rights violations, I expect you to stop using it and start doing some research - if my intuition serves you well, the people getting screwed aren't who you think they are.   EDIT: Sorry for the snooty-tude here, you don't deserve that! =\   Second, why would it be bad to put these things in a game? Spore had no massive controversy over the fact you could destroy Earth. It was little more than a novelty at it's core, though, but I think no one's going to get all up in arms over the fact a game allows you to do what humankind has talked about since we figured out the rocks in the sky are also made of minerals.   Freedom of choice - whether the choices are aligned to -your- moral compass or not - is nothing but detail, and if they're willing to code it, I see no reason they'd get hung up on this.   I mean, if you really wanted to pretend like video game rights violations were the concern, let's talk about the tons-a'-guns, let's talk about harvesting specimens from foreign planets to keep in captivity for your amusement - features already spoiled.
Tonight I went to my somewhat local game store to play fnm. I have a really weak rakdos deck and after a few practice games I decided I was gonna lose bad. I have been throwing together a krond edh for like 6 months now with the 3 for a dollar rares at the LGS I was really intimidated by edh and I did lose to a vicious Arcum deck but he said he felt bad playing it against me but I got to see the power of the formay. I lost bad only running 30 lands made my opponents kinda laugh at me. Even though I was laughably horrible when it came to deck construction and card knowledge, I didn't know what puzzle box did and they looked wildly perplexed at my ignorance. Neat card by the way, combined with the b/r enchanment that has you draw an extra card and lose a life for your drawing was brutal. I had some people help me fix my deck and I had an amazing amount of fun once my mana base and deck theme was in check. I had been playing fnm with some really hardcore players and had been losing interest in playing but now I am in love with edh and can't wait to play again because even a card that isn't played very often can change the whole direction of the game and you can't lose to an army of Boros Reckoners either.
I have to massively disagree. (Probably  spoilers )   The criticism it received was well deserved, the game is ok but nothing compared to the other games and certainly not great.   The game had terrible atmosphere, the story is fairly cliche as well as not particularly interesting nor well done and firefight was mediocre compared to other horde game types when it released.   Atmosphere: Advertised as some lone, vulnerable soldier then you proceed to rip off turrets, flip over vehicles, hijacking enemy vehicles, kill an entire cities worth of covenant while meeting up with 5 others before one gets shot but you save the day and get the AI all the while taking next to no damage but that's ok because they didn't use the same health system as halo 3, noooo halo 3 had shields after which you were vulnerable, ODST has shields and health. The difference was so barely noticeable, the shields were way too strong and health way too weak, it should have been reversed and should not have felt like you were wearing the same armour as the master chief.   ALSO   Stealth was hyped up to be a big thing but it was absolutely terrible and I mean next to non-existent, there's the first part of the game and four two minute encounters which could be done stealthily in a decent way.   The introduction of the engineer, this was annoying about halo 2 as well with brutes, it's so weird just adding enemies randomly, halo 4 did this well and I hate that game.   Lack of shit to unlock, this was a big thing about halo 3 and the infamous recon, ODST gave it to you on a plate.   It's two redeemers for me was the ending and the vidmaster achievements, oh and a third would be the zoo level.   Not particularly hard either, the other Halos were far more challenging on legendary, the firefight vidmaster was a challenge though.   Firefight! Had nothing on zombies nor the gears of war horde which were both done before it, no matchmaking either (Nor for campaign). Just play it and you'll see, the difficulty curve is also not great, it starts way too easy for too long and just over half way through it gets harder. (Vidmaster) The difficulty should've been more steadily increasing   Missed a lot of the sprinkles that made Halo just that much better such as terminals (The audio logs were not good, it's just a small story of a girl and her troubles and the AI), nothing about the wider universe, it would've been nice to hear more about the human side.   AND finally! The main criticism that was directed at ODST, DLC, it's just an expansion pack and when it was released it was released at full game price, there's not enough content to justify that, it was partly a cash grab or at least it felt like it.   It was a bare bones game but not in the way it should have been.   Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of criticisms and some are nit picky (
Anything that can run as a Live-CD can generally be coerced into running on any write-protected media. Newer hybrid ISOs have made this much easier, but have not necessarily made anything more or less capable of running this way.   > They could not finish booting. Was this because I used the install to hard drive utility [...] ?   Of course. Do you expect to be able to run a standard installation from a CD/DVD?   > Does this mean hackers cannot remotely tamper all hybrid ISOs?   No. It may be  slightly  more difficult, but it does not remove the possiblity.   > Mageia is a hybrid ISO. Does this mean I wouldn't need to install Mageia on a write protected flashdrive?   No. The "hybrid" makes little difference to what you seem to be trying to do (security), it only makes it quicker and easier to drop it on a thumbdrive without worrying about bootloaders.
Wonderful post, just what I was looking for right around now. I think I want to echo a lot of people saying as much as it seems like a region thing and that is a factor I think it is more correlated to play style. I'm new to league started a few months ago, I main ADC and recently decided to main vayne. After a long time of being very annoyed at how squishy she was I had a spree of really good games when I realised my play style with her which lead me to my build for her. I tend to max r > q > w > e because in lane I go for BOTRK or BT for the sustain and single target squishy damage (against another ADC support combo, if I was top lane I'd probably max w first and go for AS since it'd be against a tankier champion), then rushing a PD before seeing if I need a LW before getting the other life steal item for sustain and then deciding if I'm fed enough to go class cannon and go IE or get a GA.
So I've been socially awkward most my life (23yrs/f) and finally got it together to get on a dating site. Been in no serious relationships so not sure on how that goes, past experience 2 dates.   Surprise Surprise, I was asked out on a few dates with someone IRL and then someone else starts chatting to me on okcupid, great. I decided to see how things go with both, since in the past things didn't work out early on.  Turns out they're both good people and I've been on only few dates with both. No signs of things falling apart with either and i'm happy but getting worried.   I don't know how long is enough to keep dating two before knowing I'm in/close to being in a relationship or if its not working out. Or even if dating two is the right to do in the first place (no one's mentioned being exclusive with dating, haven't had sexy times so not cheating scum...I think eep). I don't know if there are un-written rules on multiple dates. Some people I know have 3 or more dates around same time, but I don't think their advice is the best.
I'd feel bad for you guys, but honestly you bring this on yourselves. EA has a long and storied history of screwing over customers. At this point it's really hard for me to imagine anyone is surprised by this kind of crap from them, especially a redditor.
Hello! I recently started crossfit about 1.5 months ago. I go 5X a week and play soccer and sometimes run or spin on top of that.   I was in decent shape prior to crossfit ( was doing HIIT training, I play soccer, yoga ect generally very active). I have noticed that I have been spotting during my cycle the last two months during weird times . I usually never spot. I am on hormonal birth control and have been on the same pill for a looonnng time, am very good at taking it, never usually spot ect ect. Pretty sure Im not pregnant.   It is so annoying! I rarely even get my period but now just randomly spot.   Anyway after some googling I saw that you can spot after working out intensely- does this happen to you and more importantly will it stop after a while???
Im a long time lurker, but I noticed a small victory today. Keto has been working slowly for me, so I cant see much visual difference despite being down about 15 pounds since the start of the year. Last month, I had a link from my watch removed and it was snug at my wrist after removing the link. I noticed today that my watch had dropped from my wrist about 1.5 inches. Its not much, but Ill take it and keep ketoing on
I wouldn't say ruined but I probably did accidently scar him for life. During an art period in third grade, my friend and I were just laughing nonstop at how funny our pictures were. He stood up to show-off his hilariously drawn picture of something (I forgot since this was around 20 years ago). I had the brightest idea of holding a pencil upright and he basically sat down perfectly onto it and the next thing I knew, he was screaming for his mom and there was a pencil stuck in his butt. Surprising we were still friends, until he moved to another school but i don't think he ever felt comfortable sitting down anymore.
I am right now facing one of the hardest challenges of my life: Doing what's best for me at the expense of others. All my life I've been Mr. Nice Guy. My friends all know that I'm supportive, caring, and non-judgmental. I'll help them in any way I can. Emotionally, financially, and physically. But it's killing me; I have given all I have to give and there's nothing left for myself.   In my freshmen year of college, I gave my roommate over a thousand dollars to help pay for his tuition and he doesn't even remember I did this. I loaned this one guy a couple hundred bucks because he told me it was really important and what he did was he bought some new clothing to go to the club with. When the Occupy movement was going starting, I donated two-thousand to my local occupation and spent two months sleeping in the park without shelter or food, often being the only one holding up the camp.   In 2011, I had sixty-thousand dollars left in my college fund, but after five years of seeking a computer science degree, I only had two years worth of credits (partially due to some credits not transfering to my new school) and I couldn't afford two more years so I dropped out and bought a house with some friends I made during the occupy. There was no landlord-tenant relationship--we lived together on a verbal agreement. One of my roommates was an asshole to me, but I never complained. The other was emotionally abusive. I had issues like not cleaning up after myself, not doing dishes often enough, and stuff like that, but over time I worked on it and those aren't problems anymore. But I'm tired of being called lazy by the person whom I bake bread and pastries for, cook for, do dishes for, and clean up after. I'm tired of being looked at as incompetent and stupid. Constantly being treated with disrespect. Being called an asshole.   It's been over a year and a half and I'm kicking them out of my house. Still, I can't help but spend some of my time thinking about where they can go and how they'll sustain themselves. What will they do with their lives? Will they move on? Will they be OK?   You're probably wondering what the hell this has to do with autism. I know that I have psychological problems unrelated to my condition, but I also know that my social naivete has lead to a life of being taken advantage of and abused. I have to be more careful in the future. I'm not asking for advice and I don't want any pity. I just wanted to know if other autistics could relate.
why bother existing at all?   I think that looking for reasons for living only causes problems, because eventually they all become dissatisfactory. In fact I think that the entire mode of thought was a misguided injection into our culture.   We're the 4 billion year descendants of survivors of a brutal past, it's usually in our nature to strive to live - and that seems to be a good point to shrug and end the discussion. We don't need to ask whether we have a 'justified reason' for growing hair out of our scalp or pumping blood or breathing oxygen in our sleeps or loving friends, it's just what we are, because of our past. A rock doesn't fail to strive to live because it lacks a well justified reason, it's just not what a rock is.
Okay, I'm currently at university and met a girl through mutual friend (we'll call her B for the sake of this post) and I'm just unsure how it's going or if she's interested or not.   We met and hooked up once at a club night after I was talking to her at a party and we hooked up later and i walked her home (didn't go in but made plans for a date) and then a week later went for coffee among other things and ended up just chilling in bed watching TV later, same day i met her after an event and i stayed the night and we fooled around (no sex) and just cuddled really (I'd already said i haven't got an issue with that).   So fast forward the next Wednesday and we have plans for the Thursday but i meet her in a club when she asked if i was around and we spend the night together again (same situation as before) and we just spend the Thursday in bed till pretty late in the day talking and I go home.   Now this is where I don't know if it's just me over thinking things; essentially when we talk outside of meeting each-other it's rarely anything to do with us being together or anything flirty (occasionally but only instigated by me) and if i ever do put anything regarding that the part of the message is just ignored and nothing said. So obviously I'm just wondering if this is a case of being shy or just too nice to tell me she isn't interested? We have another date planned early in the week so I'm planning on just flat out asking then but i just thought I'd drop it in here and see what you guys thought.   Thanks for reading!
After collecting  slave dues   ahem , taxes from my people in Miscellania, I wondered, "If I wait a day, I'll get an extra bird nest when collecting." This made me realize, the longer I waited to collect my dues, the more efficient the value of my birdnests became. So I decided to do some calculations on it.   The assumption here is that you put a maximum number of workers cutting down maple trees (10) with max approval from citizens of Miscellania (100%) and the max money withdrawn from the coffers each day (75000 gp). Bird nests are obtained at the number of logs obtained divided by 100 rounded down. So, the max number of maples logs you obtain in one day is 892, so you will receive 8 bird nests. However, if you waited one day, you would receive 1784 maple logs, or 17 birds nests. This means you get 9 nests rather than 8 by waiting to collect, which lowers the average cost of the nests if you're paying 75k a day to obtain them. By collecting everyday, you are paying the same amount for less income. This pattern continues, with the average cost of the bird nests decreasing until the 13th day, where you only receive an additional 8 nests rather than 9.   However, this does no minimize the average bird nest cost, because on the 12th day, there are still 4 logs left that you are wasting efficiency on (107 04  maple logs). Therefore, you can minimize the cost and maximize your income by waiting to collect your bird nests and logs on the  25th day.  By this point, the value of the money withdrawn from your coffers is not going to improve anymore, so collecting then is best. Also, this will require 2.625 MIL in the coffers to go 25 days without a deposit. Here's my spreadsheet of calculations:   [
i'll be replying more to this later, because i'm actually fairly new to kass, and i'm scouring the internet trying to learn stuff. i've only played handful of games.   in any case, RoA + SE is known to be a late game build that REALLY does insane damage when both pieces are stacked fully. That said, most pros atm are building only one or the other, and only a handful of soloq instances see both being built. The question is this: at what point are you trying to hit your power spike? If you can get to a ROA + SE + Zhonyas + Void + boots +  _ (lich bane? Frozen heart?) end game, you're going to have some of the highest burst in the game, esp if you have the extra mana from Frozen Heart.   2 things of note, with IBG: Kass can actually  initiate  a fight with RWE -> zhonyas, with a good bit of CC...like a pseudo Lissandra, or something. second, with IBG, Kass gets some CDR that he really doesn't find many other places. This is impt not only for his R, but for his W. W has a static CD of 6 seconds, and something like 4.8 if you have 5% CDR from runes and 5% from masteries. If W is much of his damage, like we already know, then maybe we ought to be prioritizing CDR for that ability more highly.   I'm going to be trying tear-sheen-AAS-LichBane this evening -- this is actually Froggen's build that he's trying out. I personally been doing RoA-Zhonyas-Sheen item to far, to good success. I also need to try Gunblade-LichBane-Zhonyas for a akali-esque build that someone on the General Discussion forum of lol.com swears by.   The consensus is that a sheen item is needed, because so much of Kass's power got switched into his W from the rest of his kit after the rework. What is  not  clear is the build order and the desired power spike.   There is no agreement on whether he should be a late-game hypercarry or a midgame assassin, or even a tanky disruptor (the role a kass would fill if he build IBG). IBG is sweet, definitely, and it works very well to give him a larger mana pool, but it simply doesn't have the same damage output as lich bane. If LB weren't nerfed so recenly, I don't think this would even be a question, but things change c'est la vie.   My opinion of ROA + SE is that it's probably too late-game, esp for soloq. I'll likely try it once, but i likely won't continue, because i don't think it's polite to my team to delay contribution for such a long time in a meaningful way.   I think ROA - Lich Bane will likely be a combination you see, and I think AAS - IBG will be the other combination that surfaces. Building armor on Kass will not synergize with his Q shield, in a rare instance of effective-health meaning nothing, but building a Banshee's Veil will make him a pain in the ass for magic dealers (....which is intentional, from Riot's perspective. neat.)   As a last note here, I want to mention the W mana-refund mechanic here. That mechanic is awesome. I think that THAT mechanic alone will make all kassadin players reconsider the hyper late game build with ROA and Seraphs, because as long as he can W an enemy, he can sustain his mana. If your jungler is amumu or fiddlesticks, consider not asking for blue buff. Start your flask, W the enemy, and be happy that get to play a champ with such a fun kit.   hurray for theory crafting. sorry for block of text. no
You're missing the point. proof of  a request to cheat is not necessary.     The cheating occurred. (We all agree on this)     Both Teams knew that it was occurring, Unless you want to say the first quote is a lie. (Because both teams knew and did nothing they colluded on or abetted an illegal activity thus they deserve punishment. If they allowed FAM to get away with it then it is a signal to future teams that it is ok to let your friends or allies bump you up in the standings of tournaments. IE.  IT IS NOT OK TO LET PEOPLE FIX MATCHES OR TOURNAMENTS for or against you or any other people.  FAM  knew and benefited , that is all that is required for them to be DQ'ed. If they had not known then absolutely yes, it would only fall on you but they DID KNOW so they hold definite blame and were punished accordingly.)

While I understand that polls are an important tool in the arsenal of political scientists they have little place in the real world or on the front page of reddit. They aren't accurate measures of anything. They are easily manipulated, poorly understood sources of disinformation. Furthermore, instead of contributing to the problem by link-bombing just avoid the mess altogether.   If you want to make a difference, try contacting your state representative, write an op/ed to your local newspaper or link to something more newsworthy than another worthless poll.
So I'm going through the cost of just the items listed,   Silver Sulfadiazine-amazon list the variety used for pets for [10.99](   Bacitracin Ointment- CVS has it for [4.50](   Oxycodone-hospital charges 5 dollars for a single 5mg pill, even drug dealers only charge about a dollar a piece for these things.
PLD/WAR: Accuracy buffs to Shied Oath and Defiance! Let's just hope it's enough of a boost when using flank accuracy for tank swaps.   DRG: Heavy Thrust and Phlebotomize have extended durations! Jump animations even shorter!   BRD:... Actually, I haven't heard shit about what's changing to what Bard currently has.   NIN: Aeolian Edge now requires you to use it from behind to do full damage. The current full damage, mind you. Also something about Perfect Dodge, which they called Shade Shift in the prelim notes.   MNK: Demolish boosted!... Wonder how the new skill speed effects will work with GL...   BLM/WHM: Today we (ahk) mourn the death of two spells, Flare and Holy. We shall remember them fondly as we move forward in our lives, fondly recalling the good times we have all spent with each other.   SCH: Lustrate is now a slightly worse, instant case Cure 2. .... Why? Also, fairies are now holding new tools!... At the expense of their old ones. Bye speed buffs, hello... speed buffs? Group esuna?   SMN: Enkindle has a lower cool down, some other unsaid changes but really they are just becoming fucking Bahamut now.
the back story is that my brother who is 13 (im 18 and atheist obviously) has never really thought about religion, but has always just assumed he was christian. my father got remarried last year and his new wife is mega 7th day adventist. i mean a mega christian. almost every movie in the house is a christian one, every story book, goes to church every saturday, indoctrinated the hell out of her kids, etc. my father has never really been religious either (like my brother). he just kinda never thought about it. and as soon as he got married to her, she obviously indoctrinated my father and brother. my father always rags on me now for being atheist and tells me its just a phase, that i dont know what i believe in (which pisses me off). and my brother has now become the 7th day adventist as well and defends christianity against me.   so i had a talk with my brother telling him he is way to smart to believe this junk. (he is in all gifted classes making all A's, loves science, and we are trying to get him into a governors school) i told him he needs to think for himself and research all religions and not just believe everything he is told (i went through 3 different religions testing them out before i realized i was atheist). i have realized lately that he is starting to look over my shoulder more and more as i surf /r/atheism. i can tell he is really absorbing it and thinking about it by the look of concentration on his face. it really makes me happy that he is finally questioning what he is told and thinking for himself. so i guess i just wanted to say thank you for, in a way, helping me teach my brother to think and decide for himself. you have helped get the gears rolling. sorry this was so long, just thought it was awesome.
I learned how to install / configure Drupal first before learning php. This was back when there was a very steep learning curve (drupal 6). I've recently upgraded to 7 where the learning curve is not as steep as Drupal 6.   I tried to do all that I could with the gui (core configuration, module installations and configurations, etc). You will most likely be able to find a module you're looking for without having to code one yourself. The only time you'd probably need php is when you need to do any custom themeing - even then, there's modules like Display Suite that will help you with that, no coding involved. Knowing basic php will help, but learning Drupal and php at the same time may be confusing as there is a "Drupal way" of doing things (working with hooks, etc.)   Drupal 8 is supposed to be a lot more user-friendly. Also you don't need to learn php to theme your site.   In all, maybe a solid couple months to understand the  basics , but I've been "Drupaling" for about three years (on the side, not full time) and still have a lot to learn.
I’ll start off by saying that in the culture I come from, there are no grand proposals. Marriage is something families plan together. My partner (27M) and I (24F) have established we want to get married in the next few years, so the next step is for our families to get to know each other.  He has met my family many times over the years, but I have never met his in person as they live in another country.   We have been together 3 years, and from the very start, I have been the one who is marriage-minded. He used to say he does not even believe in marriage, but since then, that’s changed as our relationship’s strengthened. Now, we talk about our future together all the time.   Although we talk about marriage regularly, we have not set any dates and only have a rough timeline (1.5 years from now) to get married. He has told his parents he wants to marry me, but they don’t seem to be that interested. In fact, they don’t want him to get married until many years from now, possibly because his sister is still unmarried (cultural thing – the girl in the family usually gets married first). I’m worried that they will expect me to wait until his sister gets married – who knows when that will be? He has shown me before he will stick up to his parents for me, but I’m worried that because they are not showing interest now, I will not get married by my 1.5 year timeline.   At the same time, now that we talk of marriage so often and it’s becoming a reality, I’m getting scared. All I see around me is divorced couples and horror stories about divorce. I see the happiest couples end up with the nastiest divorces. I don't know what goes wrong here, how so much happiness can turn into a divorced couple. I’m so happy with my partner, but am scared that something will snatch that away and our marriage will somehow fail. While wanting to get married in the timeline I have always had in my head, I am still so anxious about committing to a marriage. Rationally, I know I have no reason to believe we will not be able to solve all our problems together, but I’m scared of the unknown just because of what I have seen.   All this has been causing some minor tensions in my own relationship. On the one hand, I regularly pester my partner about talking to his parents about planning a wedding in 1.5 years or so. And, on the other hand, I find myself asking him questions like “do you believe a marriage is worth working on no matter how bad things get?” and telling him I am scared of divorce.   He’s starting to get annoyed, because literally every time we meet, I bring up a marriage-related discussion. Understandably, he feels cornered and frustrated, and as if our whole relationship is starting to be centered around this one issue. He feels we can’t do anything fun and enjoy the relationship without talking about marriage all the time. I don’t think we talk about it THAT much, but can understand that he feels this way because I am the one who brings it up often.   I don’t want to ruin our relationship by continuing to do this, and I don't want to ruin a future marriage because of my obsession with avoiding divorce.   Is there anything I can do, read, or something you guys can share with me, that may help ease my anxieties?
I can provide all the background info you guys want, but I'll summarize for now for your sake.   I launched a product in september 2012. www.lavillenue.fr   *  For those who don't speak french; it's a very graphic map of Lyon, France with a list of really cool places (bars, bookstores, theaters, music, etc) that aren't really easy to find on the internet or elsewhere. Its a map that's made for people who want to settle in this city and don't want to necessarily go to the most touristic spots, but rather find the authentic life.   Anyway, we are currently selling them in several stores (around 12 bookstores, museum gift shops and more) and through the internet, but we've come to realize that our product is very undervalued. Not  only  do we think people would be more willing to spend more on something like this, but we've (very irresponsibly and tardily) realized that our current prices won't let our business be sustainable in the long run. I have to admit this was our problem and we should have noticed earlier but this is my first entrepreneurship and my partner isn't really interested in the business side of this so it's basically been a solo learning experience.   The thing is since january we've been in the newspaper, blogs and radio a few times, showcasing our product and and in some cases commenting on the affordable price range.   --   So I guess the questions are;     should we prepare for the price raise? can we prepare somehow?   or is it just basically cross fingers and hope people don't notice or care? or maybe publicly (facebook or website) explain ourselves   Am I wrong in speaking about this stuff so openly?? should I maybe delete specific info?
I'm leaving for 4 months at the end of January. He's not sure staying together would be the best idea. I'm not sure if he's right.   I want to stay together. He's so important to me. I'm important to him. We've been dating for about 9 months now.   He has two major doubts about it.   The lesser one being that I'll end up forgetting how much he means to me, or find someone better than him, and break up with him/drift. This fear is even more reasonable than that of a usual couple.. I broke up with him roughly five months ago, not because I cheated on him, but because I felt like I had. An old crush had rekindled. I felt like it was unfair to him, and I was confused, so I broke up with him (even though I had no intention of pursuing that crush). A few weeks later, after a lot of discussion, we were back together. We still talk about it fairly frequently, making sure we're on the same page and being completely honest. It has still planted a [reasonable] seed of doubt in his mind on whether or not I can stay faithful over this time away from him.   The second reason, and the more serious one he says, is that he doesn't want it to affect his whole like at home. He doesn't want to have to spend me packages all the time. He's said that LDRs are much more difficult than I think, and he's not sure we can do it. I told him that I think I underestimate how difficult it will be, but I think you underestimate how determined I am to make this work.   Our solutions thus far:   - Stay together  - this will be difficult and will demand a lot of communication and trust. It could possibly lead to breaking up, because any little problems we would have had at home, together, are magnified by the lack of traditional interaction/communication/physical closeness/etc.   - Separate temporarily, but with heavy communication  - basically staying together, but with less responsibility. Conditions such as no sexual interaction with anyone else, complete honesty, full updates on life, being honest about how we feel about each other ("I don't think this is working, we have to fix it" or "I think I like someone else, but I will never leave you for them. Opinion on what we should do?")   - Free break  - even less responsibility. Comparable to before we had started dating. Friends, but no investment, no promises, no sexual integrity. We could each date or do anything sexual with anyone we wanted, while I was away. But then, when I get home, we'd go back to trying out our relationship again. It'd be a difficult transition both ways - out of and then back into the relationship - and it's not a sure-fire thing. He could find someone he really really likes while I'm gone, and decided not to give her up when I return.   - Break up  - neither of us wants to do this. This seems like a strange reason to just end it. I could understand moving permanently away, but this is four months. There's nothing wrong with our relationship (nothing worth breaking up over, anyway. I'm sure there are things that could be better, just like in most any relationship).
So i have been thinking recently, why has Planetside so few viewers on twitch, it's not that the player base is small. Even when there is a server smash, the viewership is really small.  One of the problem is: the game is really boring to watch. Seeing 30 personnes dying, then getting ressed grenade, getting fragged, ressed. And that is not mentioning the redeployside that is omnipresent in SS.   If you look at the top viewed games on twitch, and the games with the most Esports viewer, you see: LoL, Dota 2, CS-GO, starcraft 2 (some years ago). (and Hearthstone but lets forget about it for now) Except for CS-GO, all the others games have 1 big important common factor: they are a top down rts. The reason why CS-GO is still popular is the strategic element of the game makes it as interesting as the others 3 games. The casters in CS have a god-like view and most of the time, they are looking at the minimap and positioning of the players.   Planetside 2 would be an awesome game to watch if, after a good ressource revamp, the game becomes a big strategy battle. The competitive format could be really interesting, as the 3 teams could start with only the warp gate and some territories, and from there have to work their way to domination, with convoys to protect, ressource point to capture, commandos to disrupt the convoys, no lockons missile, big troops movement, etc   The spectating model could be more of a map like, with the observers having icons for the convoys and group of units working the map. (Think like when you zoom out alot in supreme commander) With a good balance between the fps aspect and the strategy aspect, this game could become a unique game for the players and for the watchers. Lets reach out for that ressource revamp!
Speaking as someone who has been using Linux since 1997 and mostly using nVidia in that time, I can definitely see a marked improvement in the quality of the Catalyst drivers, especially in the last 12 months. Every time I buy a new graphics card I'll always borrow or buy/return an ATI/AMD card to guage performance. Last time this happened, I actually kept the card as the drivers were close to being accdptable, but stuck with the old GTS250 for a while. Tried the HD5830 in April with the new Catalyst drivers, and it works like a dream. Not running compiz or gnome-shell though due to a 100% CPU bug, but certainly happy.
I really don't see what the deal is with tipping, the logic I have is if you did a really good job, went out of your way to make me have a good night and went above and beyond what I expect a minimum wage worker to do then you get a tip, otherwise you don't. I have plenty of friends that waiter for a job and they seem to share the same logic; they'll only get tipped if they do a good job, they don't expect to get a tip from every table.   I've worked my ass off at a few minimum wage jobs and I'm genuinely stoked when the person I've been serving says "thanks" or "keep the change" when they've given me $4 for something that cost $3.90 and that just goes straight in the till anyway, I just don't understand the attitude behind expecting tips.
I used to use my LG G3 (gave it to another line on the account) and my mom has the Samsung Galaxy S3. Recently, we've been trying to call Care but when we do it says "Processing..." and then doesn't place the call.   We have good service. On my 6+ I currently have 1 bar of LTE in my bedroom but in the living room or outside it is 3-4 of 4G OR LTE (goes back and forth).   Since this is happening on more than one Android device running two separate versions of Android it seems like a problem on T-Mobile's end, right? I recently called when I tried to place the call to T-Mobile and when I did call that time (LG G3) I dialed 611 like 5 times and finally on the 5th time it went through until I got the robot at the beginning and then the other 4 calls started to be placed all at once.   The S3 just didn't place any of the calls when we called on it. These things happened over 30 days apart from one another. We haven't tried calling on any other Android phone on the account.   One thing to note is that when my LG G3 was having this issue, I was rooted running stock ROM. My mom isn't into all that stuff so she is on stock ROM unrooted. Both on the same account.
Haha The guy osxh8 speaks of in this screenshot is me.   People were talking about who should get beta access, at the time i was rank 15 or so i believe? So i said "top 20 should on both temp leagues should get access"   zeno then responded telling me that's the worst idea because everyone on the top 20 RMT's, went on telling me about how everyone here knows and if you don't you are an idiot.   I defended myself of course, because this is my first time at top of the ladder, and game or not, i SACRIFICED to get there, and i was damn proud of it.   I simply told Zeno he was an idiot and i had lost all respect in him. Insta ban, then he goes on to flame me with his cultist fans, as they ensure him i am literally cancer and the reason to all pain in the world.
A few comments, I hope it helps!     Smaller image on top, the more users have to scroll down, the less they do...     I have to disagree partially with poorsoi: I think your first paragraph was great. You clearly differentiate yourself and bring a little bit of warmth and personalization. Users like it and almost expect it from small shops. However, try to find something else to say other than: "please find below 4 of our products". You could have posted a small and funny paragraph about new year resolutions linked to some of your products for example.
There is something wrong with the CSS you have in place. 99/100 the problem is due to there being a missing }. This is a bug with reddit, but you should know at least the syntax basics by now. Check the latter part of your stylesheet and ensure you don't have something like   .flair-red{ color: red;    which is invalid but  will  pass in reddit. The problem comes when you try to cut/paste new CSS after that. So   .flair-red{ color: red; .flair-yellow{ color: yellow; }    for example, won't work because of the missing closing brace. This is almost certainly the source of your error.
I do the same thing with my wife. But still it causes problems. I think it comes down to after working all day and spending time with her.. playing after she sleeps still is more time per week spent playing Destiny than with her.   Also, I think the fact that I enjoy Destiny so damn much makes her jealous that I don't enjoy hanging out with her the same.   My point is, no matter how much you try to accommodate your partner, if they don't like your hobby it's going to be a problem.
So I was reading the Josh Peck AMA when this happened:   I had no idea what he/she was referring to, and neither did anyone else in the rest of that comment thread. I went over to IMDB and found that there were 3 episodes I hadn't seen and had no available description ("The Birthday Party", "Drake's Dad and Josh's Mom", "The Return of Milo."  I went on other websites (ie Wikipedia) and didn't see these episodes listed.  Amazon Instant Video had only up to "Helicopter." Does anyone know if these are real episodes, and if so where can I watch them?
POSTED IN JANUARY 2014: But down voted.   [Link to original post](   Shibes, please hear me out. Moolah.CH has built a great reputation on this sub-Reddit and my intention isn't to tarnish it. But I want you to take caution before sending them $550 for their ATM. My reason, WHO are you sending your money to?????? I mean who is this person. Once you send them $550 in BTC, LTC or DOGE you will never be able to get it back if this turns out to be a scam. All I am asking Moolah.CH to do is to tell who they are. I have asked and the only response I've gotten is "it will all be made public once the incorporation is done". The date for that however is unknown. So for starters I'm just asking Moolah.CH to include their faces (as in speak to us) in the video that they will be posting soon to demonstrate their product. I don't think that is such an unreasonable request. Let's not have another Dogecoin scam. If this is a scam, let's nip it in the bud and if it's not then I will apologize profusely and Dogecoin will rise to the moon with this ATM. But remember, if you're purchasing one of these ATM's, you're sending money to someone that you don't know.
I was staying over at a friends house, when the terrifying urge to piss clutched at my bladder. I didn't know anyone in the house except her so it was majorly awkward !!! I also didn't want to ask her where the bathroom was. So for 24 tortuous hours I held it in praying to any god that could hear me not to piss myself. I even drank a litre of slush puppy while having agonising pains in my bladder. Could not wait to get home. Yes I am a retard but also thank fuck I have one kidney!!!
I think many apps' use of menu can be excessive when a tab toolbar is more effective. If your app has 4 views or less, from an UX perspective, a tab toolbar is more user friendly because it offers the user a single-tap to their desired view. It make sense if the app requires more than 4 different views since anything more than 4 usually crowds the toolbar. I can see that those hamburger menu can add a wow effect when they slide out, but that second tap to get to where I want when a single tap should be efficient can be annoying.
Background   I'm a CS undergrad particularly interested in AI, and have gotten my feet wet with ML through internships, Stanford's online AI course, and a job I have at a startup doing simple text mining and less-simple searching (and I'm also learning through osmosis as the software company I have a summer job at just got acquired by IBM's Big Data division). I'm also incredibly interested in 18th-century Scottish fiddle music, and my chief hobby for the past six years has been playing, composing, and otherwise studying it.   I've noticed that there's a lot of patterns in the tunes. The vast majority are 32 bars (measures), there's a handful of patterns that make ~5 unique bars get repeated in such a way as to fill the 32 (one common idiom is playing ABAC ABAC DEDC DEDC twice, where each letter represents a bar). And when playing a tune I've never seen or heard before, I sometimes have correct intuitions about what new content will come next--there's a lot of melodic and chordal patterns whose precise nature I can't quite articulate.   Project   So as any sensible person would do when faced with vague theories and good data sources, I want to package up several thousand tunes in [ABC notation]( cause my computer to do incantations over them, look at the patterns my program finds out of pure musicological interest, and then use them to generate new tunes.   Now it's time for the question : do you know of any previously done work on something similar? I've spent a good amount of time trying to find things, but can only find audio-based projects. I'm not interested in analyzing the genre of an MP3 or contrasting the performance style of two artists. Nor am I interested in smashing together several loops of electronic sound and calling it music. This is a strictly sheet music-based project.   Practical Details   From a logistics standpoint, I'd have a little bit of time this upcoming academic year to work on it (on the side), and if I wanted to I could have about twelve 20-40 hour weeks in the summer of 2013. In the summer and fall of 2013 I plan to be in Edinburgh studying ethnomusicology (yay, domain knowledge). I'm also thinking of applying to the [Singularity Institute]( and spending a week or two there in the beginning of the summer--if anyone has any thoughts on that I'd be interested in hearing them.   By asking about prior work I'm hoping someone will link me to a journal article where I'll learn what algorithms other people have used and how (un)successful that was--which would give me a place to start. If that doesn't work out:   Current Strategy   First I'll create a hierarchy of things I'm interested in. One group might be broadly responsible for the overall structure of a tune, and I'll have one node recording data on length, another node recording data on which patterns of repeated bars are used, etc. Another top-level group might be broadly responsible for figuring out what type of note comes after what, with nodes that keep track of intervals (be it a minor third or a fifth or whatever), chord patterns, relative position in the bar, relative position in the tune, relationship to the key signature, etc. And so on and so forth. This obviously requires a lot of thought, and I'd like to try as much as possible to make things specific enough to be easily findable in the corpus, but abstract enough to be useful in a broader context. Then I'll run the corpus through them to get the actual data, inspect the results, probably iterate on that a few times as I realize what type of information is more valuable than others, and then feed it all to a glorified Markov chain generator for the composition aspect.     I've done my best not to make an imposing wall of text, but...I wanted to make sure you had all the information you might want. The main question is about previous efforts, but anything else you'd like to add to the discussion is very welcome. Does this seem like a reasonable project? Any words of warning? I'm aware that even if everything goes perfectly according to plan and I have an automatic traditional tune spitter-outer the usefulness is questionable (not much of a market to monetize it with, and it seems a bit out there to go the academic route with)...it's purely for personal interest, pragmatism be darned.   Thanks!
Just an FYI, no single "genetic root" has been found for autism or ADHD, or any other mental disorder for that matter (let alone for multiple disorders). Some evidence supports some common DNA strand within, say, autism or schizophrenia, but even then the evidence is minimal because so many people with a particular disorder do not have that 'hypothesized strand x'. Many genomic studies on these disorders have been done, and various "genetic links" have been found, but, again, heterogeneous variability.
Think about the things that YOU need. i.e. the things that you CONSUME.   From there, then you can think about what you need to do to PRODUCE these goods.   From economics101, you have production vs consumption. If you produce MORE than you consume, then you are going to have a surplus(i.e. you are saving). If you consume MORE than you produce, then you are going to have a deficit. (i.e. maybe you can can consider bankruptcy).   Now back to your question. There are stuff that you need and want. Stuff that you NEED are more survival level stuff. e.g. food/water/shelter/medicine/transportation. Stuff that you WANT are more for comfort/enjoyment. e.g. bottle of wine, computers, private car.   Now, you know what you need, now you can figure out the AUTOMATION of the PRODUCTION side.   e.g. make a machine to AUTOMATE farming. TRADE your surplus of food from your farming machine for water, clothes, computers.   The reason that most people(including myself) are not financially free is because we haven't figured out how to AUTOMATE the production of products/services (and trade the surplus of what we have with others).   At best, we have machines to SEMI-AUTOMATE the production of products/services.   e.g. I want to travel to the city. I could either walk, or I could drive (SEMI-AUTOMATION). But I still need to physically work the machine.   If I had a fully AUTOMATED self-driving car, then not only could I skip driving, I could use it to PRODUCE a taxi service that other people have a DEMAND for.
Some background:   My current girlfriend was married very young and has an ex-husband that treated her badly. Around 8 years into her relationship him he asked for a divorce. What she described seemed so bad I don't understand why it didn't end a lot sooner. From her it didn't sound like they were in love, but then why would it have lasted so long?   1) 1-2 years after the divorce she moved across the country, but had her ex-husband and his new fiancee move into her house in so that she wouldn't have to rent to someone she didn't know. This keeps her in contact with him about rent and things around the house that go wrong. It seems odd as she has harbors a lot of anger and resentment about him. She woke up one night and told me she had a dream about physically harming him in a torturous fashion.   2) There are some nude pictures of her taken by one of her current male friends that she stays in contact with. She says they've never had sex and it's a platonic relationship.  However, his current girlfriend is very jealous when they are together which I can kind of understand because of a few reasons. She has said that she would change clothes in front of him and that he likes seeing her naked. Plus she would spend the night at his house when his girlfriend wasn't there. She told me he deleted the pictures from his computer. Not that it would bother me if he had the pictures still, which I'm pretty sure he does. I just don't understand the nature of that friendship. It's obvious to me that he likes her so I don't understand why she would mess with him like that.   3) She talks about exes a lot (to the point of being annoying), I don't really like hearing about them. They are all very bad, from the stories she has told she hasn't had any good relationships. They are all about her having sex with someone gross, physically or mentally abusive, or who she wanted to destroy using sex.   4) I'm sure she loves me and she seems to view me as the best thing since sliced bread. It's just all these things and stories she keeps telling are disturbing and are sending up red flags. I would never judge someone for their past like that, but I really don't like some of the things she has said.   I find these things very odd and would like to get others perspective on them.   Thanks for reading :)
I [22M, single] live in Provo, Utah. I have to pretend to be Mormon even though I don't believe in their church so that I don't get expelled from my school (BYU) and fired from my job (the Mormon church). (Yes, I know; I only stay for the money. Otherwise, I would have left long ago.)   I really need a girl in my life after having been single for four years. Yes, I know I'm young, but I (like everyone else) have emotional and physical needs, and it's driving me nuts!   I've recently tried dating three different typical Mormon girls, and each time it's ended in disaster. I need to find someone who thinks like me. My problem is that I can't come out and say, "Hey, I pretend to be Mormon but I'm not. How about you?" If people started catching on I'd be fucked.   Where the hell should I go and what the hell should I do to find girls who think like me in this Mormon-saturated place?
Is the Drug problem really that bad in Copenhagen? I was walking around Malmo the other day and coming from NY I commented on how you dont really see much street kids/crust punks/junkies around Malmo Ive travelled to alot of US cities but you see this mainly in Boston, NYC, New Orleans, Austin tx, Portland, Seattle, San Fran/oakland.. but Malmo I didnt really see much people where your first thought is Oh they are just bumming money to get some dope - My friend said oh no most of those types are in Copenhagen where its cheaper and less strict. Just Wondering -
I like TM&WL better than Peep Show, but I've found that I can't watch more than a couple of episodes each.  My old roomie and I tried marathoning TM&WL once and we just got tired of it after a few episodes.
I (20/f) have been dating my boyfriend (24/m) for about three years with a short break. I am more experienced in the bedroom than him, and have a greater sex drive. Yet lately it seems as though he doesn't want it at all. We went two weeks without sex, and he turned me down when I invited him inside. A few days later we finally had it only because he spent the night at my place, drunk. A week later I tried seducing him again, and he turned me down. Now, a week after that, after literally throwing myself at him because I haven't even seen him in the past few days, he turns me down again. I don't know what to do, and I honestly feel unwanted. I had to get a new toy to satisfy myself. I'm not sure what to do/say, but this stuff is literally making me feel like shit. I get.no explanation, just an 'I love you'.
This happened in the first night of a 3 day stay in a hostel in Florence. A friend and I stayed in an 8 person room. Our shared bunk was in an isolated corner of the room with an adjacent row of lockers in front. My friend had the top, I was on the bottom. I woke up around 5am to find a Brazilian guy wearing only his tighty-whities sitting at the end of my bed. Freaked out and groggy from sleep I asked him, "Hello, what are you doing?". He got up and walked towards me. Starting to get scared, I tried to distant myself from him by moving over in my bed. He thought I was making room for him and he crawled into my bed. He started to cuddle and kiss my neck. I thought about screaming rape and I knew the people in the room would help me and the guy would get into a shitload of trouble. Then I assessed the situation quickly and realised this guy was shitfaced drunk and had no idea what he was doing. I pushed him away and angrily whispered to him to fucking leave. He got irritated, rolled over and passed out. Me being a tiny 5'1" female trying to kick and shove an average sized guy off my bed was impossible. No matter how hard I slapped and jabbed him, he didn't wake up. The bunk started to rock back and forth from the force of my pushing. My friend on the top bunk woke up and confusedly called my name. I'm pretty sure at this point the whole room was awake and thought we were doing the nasty. About an hour and a half passed and somehow I woke him up. He must have finally sensed my anger and he got up to leave in a bit of a huff. An hour later everyone else in the room checked out early. Later on just as my friend and I were leaving the room to go sight-seeing, I heard him wake up and I caught a glimpse of him embarrassingly peeking over the locker partition. I never saw him again.
Hello r/bangtan! Two days ago I went to BTS Epilogue in Tokyo, the final concert of their Asia tour (14th of August), and so I’ll write a short fan-account about my experience! Hopefully this will be fun to read, and also good information for anybody planning to attend a k-pop concert in Japan. This will be pretty long, but I’ll try to structure it so it’s easy to read.   To begin with: I have never been to a k-pop concert, but been a k-pop follower since 2010-ish. I’m a 21 year Swede (hence interesting English in this post) but I had planned a vacation to Tokyo, which happened to be the same time as BTS would perform!   Tickets:   Was definitely the hardest part. I cannot say in detail how we got them as it was my friend who got them, but it was resale tickets. We bought them for 24 500 yen (approx. 240 dollars), original price however was 9 800 yen. Long story short: it’s almost impossible to buy Japanese tickets from abroad, as you need a Japanese phone number (and address I think) in order to purchase them. My friend had a Japanese contact she’s bought merchandise from previously, and he bought her the tickets on resale for us. We got them from him the same day as the concert, all very smoothly!   Before the concert:   When we arrived at the venue at around 10 am, there was a HUGE line for the merchandise tent. It was really hot as well sunny, over 30 degrees, and stone/asphalt radiating heat from the ground. Since we were on vacation we decided to not stand in the line and went walking around/eating lunch in Harajuku instead. When we came back a bit before 3 pm when the doors would open, and there was no queue to the tent. However, most merch were sold out, but light sticks, photo books, towels, randomized photo cards, shopping bag and some other things were still available. Generally, the things that were member-specific sold out quickly.   The people at the concert:   Mostly girls, a few fanboys (as expected). What was unexpected for me however was the age! I found that most people I saw was around 23 maybe, not that many under 20. This surprised me as I reckoned that in Korea they were more popular with middle/high school students (wasn’t there something about BTS being the most popular group for elementary students?). The Japanese fans seemed mostly to be noona fans, even with some ahjumma fans, like moms going together to the concert (I even saw a grey-haired woman with a Yoongi-fan!)   The venue:   I’m not sure how many seats there were, but there was only seating, even on the floor. People stood up the whole concert however, even us on the sides (obviously). It was no shoving or problems on the floor from what I could see, it seemed pretty calm even when BTS was throwing signed little balls to the audience. I was sitting in the back, but could still see them very well when they were out on the catwalk thingie.   The atmosphere at the concert:   …was pretty interesting. Since I haven’t got any previous k-pop experience and no previous Japanese concert experience, I cannot really say why, but these are the things I noticed:     The Japanese fans were quiet during the songs, especially ballads. Not even screaming in instrumental parts of the songs (like after the chorus, before the second verse in Autumn Leaves… So epic, yet quiet).    They only screamed when there was music when there was fanservice (occasionally when there were zoom-ins on the screen of mainly the makane line)   After every song, they would only scream/applaud for about 2-3 seconds (I counted) and then go quiet until the next song, making it almost awkward to me? Maybe I'm too used to excessive screaming/applauding   The audience was respectful to BTS when they spoke. No interruptions with desperate “oppa I love you” or anything like that   I’d say 95% of us had the official light stick. Or maybe more. Lots of ARMY Bombs!   All of the BTS members got a lot of love and cheers, but the makane line was definitely the most popular. Jongkook got them noona fans in Japan…     The music:   Amazing. They had a proper live band, proper microphones (handheld), proper sound management. This blows even the best music shows out of the window (obviously). The live band gave power to the songs, and gave them a bit more live-edge if that makes sense. The vocals were stronger (carried though more?) than in music shows and in other live performances I’ve watched, and I really liked that. Think acoustic “clearness” of vocals yet with heavy instrumentals!   The language barrier:   Even I could tell BTS Japanese was quite basic. But since they were happy and mispronunciations were actually appreciated by the audience (kawaii~) this wasn’t really a problem. They didn’t have a Japanese MC or anything like that, and their speeches were pretty short. They only spoke longer in the interludes where short interviews were played on the screens, where BTS spoke in Korean with Japanese subtitles.   The  (bulletproof)  boys:   Were all professional and great performers. Their charisma is real, that’s all I can say really. Their personas are the same in the concert as in variety/Bangtan Bombs. Suga was pretty funny, and Jimin was more precious than “fanservice-y” ( except for No More Dream of course ) than I thought. I’m not even sure what to say, just that they exceeded my expectations a lot, and they were pretty high.   Now to the actual concert!   Intro: Fire MV  This was pretty weird. The whole venue, chanting  “FIYAAAA-H”  to the MV, without the boys even being present…But it built hype!   Run – Danger – Autumn Leaves – Tomorrow – Butterfly – Love Is Not Over – House of Cards – What Am I To You – Boy in Luv - Interlude  These were the opening songs to the concert. Run and Danger, two solid title tracks. Autumn Leaves, Tomorrow, and House of Cards are three of my absolute favourite BTS songs, with amazing Tomorrow-choreography… Boy in Luv is such a hype song to hear live, and the audience actually made some noise!   Save ME – Fire – We Are Bulletproof Pt.2 – Cypher Pt.3: Killer – Intermission  Save ME and Fire were amazing performances, with sharp choreography and solid fanchants. But the real hype came with We Are Bulletproof. You have not lived until you’ve heard Jungkook say “ireumeun Jongkook” live. Cypher was HYPE.   If I Ruled the World – Baepsae – Dope – Boys With Fun – Attack on Bangtan – No More Dream  After Fire and Save Me, I almost became worried that the concert was reaching its end considering that they’re the last. I was so wrong, all these songs were so HYPE. Especially Boys With Fun seemed like a personal favourite with the Japanese audience! With these songs, they ran around a lot on the stage between the choreo, hyping the audience.   Encore:   While waiting for the encore, the fans were mostly quiet. After a while, some  BTS! BTS!  chanting began, but it never really took off in our section. Then, suddenly people started to sing the chorus of Young Forever., and everyone joined in. We must have sung it at least 10 times, and it actually sounded really good and clean in the venue (not like other concert-screaming-singing I’ve participated in before haha). We kept singing until another intermission (interviews) begun.   Intermission – Epilogue – Young Forever – Whalien 52 – Miss Right – A Japanese song I think– For You – I Need You   I’m not exactly sure here about the song order. The other songs on the set list were the same as previous concerts, but the Encore was where they had their Japanese Only-songs. Also somewhere in here I think they had a short instrumental showing off all the band members and their instruments (drum solo, guitar solo etc).  These songs were great to end the concert with. Starting the Encore with Young Forever and ending it with I Need You was perfect. Then they ended the concert with walking around, thanking the audience properly, and finally, after a long time, disappeared behind the closing HYYH logo. EPIC.   After the concert:   The organisers helped everyone to come outside. It was cramped but calm as people made their way back to Harajuku Station. Everyone was nice, no problem getting to public transport!   Now this was SUPER LONG and took quite a while to write. Please ask me questions if you have any and I’ll do my best to answer, it might take a day though because I’m still on vacation!
I literally moved my life to be with him and he broke up with me yesterday to 'settle his debt and deal with his mother's cancer', even though he doesnt really like his mother and my parents offered to help us financially. I now have to move back home with my parents, because I have nowhere else to go. I have no job and have exhausted my savings trying to make this work.  I feel frustrated  and completely stupid to have believed that this guy loved me.  How do I get over this and move on with my life?
My ex who I dated about 2 months ago for about 2 months is getting upset with me via Facebook Chat. I told her that I don't think having a tequila night with just her is a great idea anymore, (we planned it a little while back as an "After Finals Celebration") because we are both seeing other people. It is not too serious on my end and she is actually seeing two people. One is more serious than the other.   She is offended because she thinks I am ditching her as a friend and that since we both don't have feelings for each other it is not weird. I say that since we are both now seeing other people we should respect them and not hang out alone and get drunk. She keeps saying that I only liked her as a girlfriend and is very offended.   Am I right to think that it is disrespectful to hang out with my most recent ex and get drunk when I have already been on a few dates with another girl.
I haven't officially moved into MY APARTMENT (own bedroom, bathroom, we have two living rooms with furniture), but most of my stuff is there. I have $75 on an Amazon certificate (I can only buy stuff sold exclusively by Amazon.com, Amazon Warehouse, or AmazonBasics) and $100 more that I'm willing to spend.   The room is 9'x10', plus a 2'x2' entryway and a 5'x3' closet (Caution: These are all estimates). Currently I have a twin bed with gray sheets and a blue quilt, a 2'x1.5' bedside table, and a trash can. The pillows are pretty squishy, but it's not a big deal. I also have a 5'x3' white melamine (and particle board?) table that I'm using as a desk. Now I will describe what is on my desk: a three-level drawer thing filled with medical and dental care supplies, a picture of my dog, a cool IKEA bendy light thing, a cylinder of Wet Ones (TM), books and binders, my laptop, a power strip and chargers, and a carousel filled with pencils, pens, staples, stapler, ruler, scissors, sharpies, etc.   The closet has my clothes and shit (yes, actual stinky shit). I have an over-the-door hanger thingy. All kitchen and bathroom supplies are most likely taken care off. Yes, I have a trash can in the bathroom (no, it doesn't have a lid) and a slow cooker in the kitchen.
Postloop]( Ref]( is a website that allows you to make money posting on forums. It's a global site, so it should work everywhere. This guide will show you how it works and how to maximize your earnings getting a high rating. If this guide helps you, please consider signing up under my referral. If you are already familiar with Postloop and you are just looking for advices on how to get a high rating, just skip to the last section of the guide.   How Postloop works: The Point System   The idea behind Postloop is simple: it pays you to post on certain forums about certain topics. The method, however, is quite complex: everything works via points. Basically forum owners purchase points from Postloop, and when someone posts in their forums the poster gains the points lost by the owner. The more points a forum has, the more points the poster can gain.  On average a single point will give you 1,4 points , and the amount gained depends on your rating and the forum points.   The minimum payout is 100 points. The conversion ratio is 0,05 cent per 1 point, so the minimum payout is 5$. You can't withdraw money if your score is under the average user rating, 3.18 right now, but unless you are costantly receiveing bad ratings you shouldn't worry about not meeting the payout requirement. [Proof here]( 5,58$ for 70/75 posts. Postloop pays daily via PayPal, and you will receive your money a few hours after the request, the maximum is 24 hours.   Getting Started - The Postloop Portal   To get started, you need to qualify for the site posting 10 "example posts" on the Postloop Portal.  This is not a mere test because, if you are accepted, Postloop will give you a rating  depending on many factors, and having a high rating is crucial to make decent money on Postloop (more on that later).  You won't receieve another rating for a long time, so try your best to get a good score here . Don't take this test lightly or you'll regret it! First of all, you need to follow the instructions given by Postloop and  subscribe to the Postloop Portal . Let me repeat that:  before starting posting, you need to subscribe to the Postloop Portal.  It's the most common mistake, since your posts won't count unless you are subscribed to the Postloop Portal.   After subscribing, start making some quality posts following these rules:     Double check your grammar . Making too many mistakes means getting rejected or having a low score   Write long posts . The minimum is five sentences, more is better   Write quality content, always stay on topic and add something to the conversation. There are a lot of different forums, so choose wisely.   Don't write only replies, but  create new threads as well . Something like 7 replies and 3 new threads should be fine, but you can get penalized for not creating enough new topics.   Interact with other users, for example quoting their replies, and look as natural as possible.   Double check your grammar again. I can't emphasize how important it is to get a good score at this test.     Now wait a little for your approval, up to 24 hours.   Why the rating from the Postloop Portal is so important.   Following my advices you should be able to get a rating of 4,5+ quite easily. Congratulations! This will give you two advantages:     Some forums require a minimum rating to subscribe. A 4,5+ will give you access to most forums, except a few specific forums with higher standards.   You get a fixed amount of bonus points depending on your rating. With a 4,5 rating you will get 0,50 bonus points per post,  with a 5 stars rating you will get 1 extra point per post .  More info here  quickly. If you do an average or above average job, don't expect a rating. If you do an excellent job, you can hope to be rated and even to receive a bonus for your content.  In short, unless you make a terrible or an excellent work, you will keep your initial Portal rating for a long time.     How and Where to Post - Maximizing your earnings.   First of all, choose a forum from the list you are given. The top forums on the list have more points and will give you more points, so keep that in mind. Before starting, register to the forum you chose and then subscribe to them from the Postloop site. Lastly, check the requisites. Every forum has different requisites, but usually they include:     Don't mention Postloop   50+ words per post   Only post on specific boards   Don't be rude, don't spam, don't post referrals unless allowed, just use common sense   Interact with other users and be as natural as possible. It's easy to spot other Postlooper if you are a regular, so try to reply to them and they will reply back to you.   Upload an avatar, sometimes a picture of yourself is preferable, but again it depends on the forum.     Even if they are not specified, follow these rules and you shouldn't have troubles and eventually you will receieve another positive rating.  However many forum owners, as I already wrote, will never rate you, so don't waste too much time making mini-essays on those forums.  Instead write shorter (but not too short) posts of a decent quality and focus your attention elsewhere. Let's be honest: you are not getting paid a lot of money for the posts you make, so decide how much time you want to invest in a single post. On the other hand  if you find a new forum you are more likely to receive a rating or even a bonus, so it's always worth to give it a try and focus on that. Write longer, higher quality posts and see if the forum owner recognizes your effort with a 5 stars rating or a bonus . If it happens, keep posting there, otherwise move to different forums or make "average quality" posts. Never, never write short posts, one liners and so on. Not receiving a rating doesn't imply that your posts are not being controlled.   Other general informations:     Usually there is a daily limit to how many post you can create on a forum. Sometimes the limit is 5 posts per days, sometimes 10, sometimes there isn't a limit at all.    Posting on forums with more points means getting more points   Some forums have a star close to the Subscribe button - it means that you get extra points for posting there.   There are a lot of forums to choose from, so focus on the topics you like. Your posts will be more natural.   If you feel like you have received an unfair rating, try contacting the forum owner.   You will earn the 20% of the points of your referrals.   Postloop is a global site, so you can post from everywhere in the world.   If you think that you are not making enough money for the time you are investing, change your posting style. Maybe you are writing 200+words posts when a 100 words post should be enough.  Understand when it's better to aim for the quality and when for the quantity.  If you have more questions, feel free to ask them here or via PM.

Preface: I am NOT the best story teller. I'm sure I've got a lot of fluff and not a lot of adjectives.   Shrooms were the best thing I've ever done in my life. I don't think I've ever had such an awesome experience like it except the first time I had sex maybe. Even the day after taking them I still felt great.   I don't know what made me think of it today but I wanted to share my small experience with my first time that I did shrooms, in an amount that would do something. (my second time is another experience to talk about later)   Small intro:  I used to smoke weed quite often between 2011-2012. Must've smoked at least every other night. Not a lot but every now and then picked up some good and heavy stuff. A friend of mine introduced it to me. Sometime during the beginning of this year I dropped the habit. Preferred being sober from it.   I also had some small experience with shrooms in the past. Sometime during the beginning of HS I had a small dose of shrooms at a friend's overnight get together. Didn't really "trip" or at least didn't notice. Second time was hunting for them myself with a couple of friends. I lived out in the middle of nowhere at the time. Apparently we used a spot that many others had used, since there were none to be found. One night we found maybe three, with the caps the size of dimes then I found one myself the size of a common kitchen bowl. I tried to share and they told me finder's keepers, whatever, ate it right then and there. Thirty minutes later I smoked a bowl and saw some dark swirling spots surrounding me in the dark a little bit, nothing special.   Experience: My recent experience started when the topic of LSD came up sometime a few months ago. Since the beginning of HS and reading/learning about it, I've always wanted to try it or at least something that would cause me to hallucinate. Well, funny thing is, a friend that I was giving rides for to go pick up some weed told me his guy had come across shrooms and I could try that I should try that out first. I agreed and got 2 grams.   This was on a Thursday night sometime after midnight. I had told myself before even going out to buy it that I was going to make sure this was going to be a good trip. I've heard about bad trips before (with Acid, lsd, shrooms...). I told myself I'll stay calm and be chill no matter what happened. I also made sure I was doing it around someone who's experienced it before, the guy who was picking it up with me.   We get back home and I chomp them down with some water. If you get them dried, they're kinda chalky and chewy. At first, I was going to wash them down with soda. Friend said water was a better idea. (you gotta watch what's in your stomach when doing shrooms) Well, 45 minutes later I finally felt a buzz coming on and got a little anxious and excited. Told myself again to calm down and chilled out a bit.   I laid down on our couch and watched my two friend's play some Xbox. Then it started. Colors got brighter and more vibrant, my vision took on more clarity, and shadows took on more depth. This was nice for me since without my glasses I normally have horrible vision and I'm red/green deficient. I had a real nice body high starting. I'm normally a quiet person but when I finally talked, my voice was even softer and quieter than it was. I felt very calm and relaxed.   Now, I didn't hallucinate. No flying pigs, no unicorns, no demons, or out of place imaginary things. Nothing. Though I can say some shadows shifted here and there a bit and I'm pretty sure the office chair my friend was in, was vibrating. Also, I was giggling a lot. I'm not one to giggle but, I was practically giggling at everything. Nothing like laughing at dumb and dumber stupid but a just a very euphoric feeling.   A hour or so later I decided I'd see what it was like outside. A great decision. If you've ever meditated and found that peaceful and happy feeling after a great session, this is what it was like walking outside. The unfortunate thing was that it was night, full moon but, still didn't get to enjoy the scenery as much as I would have if it had been sunny out.   We have a tree in the center of our front yard (rental home w/small property). Looking up through the branches it was like looking at it from a different perspective than normal. I kept seeing webs of patterns. The air was a comfortable mild warm and humid mixture.   My friend eventually joined me outside and told me I should try undressing and laying down. Being a little modest, I just took my shirt off (I'm a guy) and layed down near the side of the house. It felt like laying in a bed of soft grass. I felt so damn comfortable. The next day, I noticed that where I laid. It was mostly dirt, dried leaves, sticks, and weeds.   For anyone who's meditated as a practice and did it consistently for 6-12 months. Shrooms is like coming out of a good long session, where you have that awesome peaceful feeling, except with a great clarity of vision and colors. It also lasts a while.   (
Some advice right from of my heart here. Be warned, foul language and caps ahead with very good reason.   I carried last game so incredibly hard, going 7/0/6 as Volibear Jungle, we were all about 3 levels ahead, probably had like a 10k gold lead before my first death.   Eventually ended up going 14/8/9.   Turning point? Baron Buff.   We won a 'team fight' > We got 2 kills, (Ryze Top and Fiddle Support) were 3/4th hp, team decides 'LETS DO BARON'.   I, having a major ass fear for this exact reason, say NO. DONT.  Team does it anyway. I gotta go and help them out, since they dont have a fucking smite and yet keep doing it, even when clearly stating NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO   What happens? Ofcourse, 10 seconds into Baron, bam! 3 teammates die to enemies. Bam! I get taunted by rammus for 3 seconds, baron gets stolen.   Bam! I get flamed the entire game for not smiting that. We lost that game. A game that should have been easy as SHIT got thrown simply by a purple god damn buff.   Now I don't really care since I was on 0 LP anyway (just promoted) but MY GOD PLEASE DON'T DO BARON EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER
It was a kid that did not like me, he is an expert at seeing what you type apparently, because he watched me log into RuneScape during one of my college classes, and seen my user name and password, simply logged in after I logged out, dropped all my stuff, and left a note in the Notes saying 'Cheers, from your pal (His name here'. When I confronted him about it, he said that if I laid a single hand on him, he would contact the dean.
I actually responded to each of the points made by Aguyinachair and clicked the Save button, but it did not appear to be saved. The gist of it was that it is always about perspective. I will have to reply to you with the same point. Once you are able to view sexual services in the same way you view a massage or a visit to the doctor, this idea that there exists some sort of terrible objectification diminishes. Please dont confuse this for the 'take the vagina off the the pedestal' argument, which it isnt. My argument is that we need to change our views about sex in order to facilitate a safe industry.   When thinking about the legalization of prostitution, you seem to picture the equivalent of a Nike factory in the slums of China, employing innocent children for pennies per hour. This would never happen in the States. Yes, there would be establishments that provide an environment for the prostitutes to do their job, but why cant they simply charge the prostitutes a housing fee, leaving the prostitutes as free agents? Furthermore, what stops a person from setting up shop in the comforts of their own home as long as they meet certain safety requirements? There doesnt need to be a pimp.
Hitler Had the belief that There was one pure "Arian" race and that they were the chosen people. The ones who deserved Germany. IT wasn't so much that he was racist against Jews, but that he was racist "for" Arians. (if that makes sense). The Jews were just the biggest group of people that was affected. Gays, certain Christians, criminals, and  circus freaks (or any type of person that didn't fit in) also got sent to concentration camps. The reason we associate it with the Jewish people is because it was the biggest group, because it was an entire race of people and it was something they couldn't change, Even if the changed their religion to Christianity, and the type that Hitler wanted, they still couldn't escape because they were by blood Hebrew. Yes Hitler was crazy but that wasn't his one motivation behind the Holocaust.   Like Denieru said He didn't just come out sending them to concentration camps. It started peacefully then moved toward violence and genocide, and as it drug on more people kept being added to the mix, non blond haired blue eyed people ect. But the fact is Hitler was quite intelligent, and genuinely believed that he was doing what was right for his people. Every good leader does it, the difference is that Hitler's idea of what was right and good for his people was a horrible act of racism and attempted genocide. His words moved millions of people to do something they probably wouldn't have done otherwise, and he did it because he wanted to see them succeed, not because he wanted to see others suffer.
This is a really complex question with a really complex answer, your ability to answer this question is tied with your level of progression from new to experienced player and having an intuitive understanding of the answer to this question strongly correlates with your ability as a player overall.   Lategame as a support? best item in the game is a vlads. But only if you're running with a melee carry/melee heavy lineup. Otherwise its a mek. But only if you're dealing with a lineup of non-bkb piercing physical damage leaning opponents. If they've got bkb piercing spells that do high damage then a pipe is best. Except if its something like beastmaster with aghs, in which case a force-staff is best so you can reposition someone thats' stunned. But if its a lina with aghs thats producing the damage, in which case a linkens is best to pop on anyone she euls(es) otherwise they're going to likely die.   As a carry? Well obviously you need a bkb unless you're a hero like medusa or weaver or terrorblade where you'll need to buy a linkens or a radiance or a skadi. Unless the opponents are people like PA or brewmaster or someone like bristleback that can afford to go butterfly/halberd easily in which case you need an MKB for their evasion but you also need to be mindful of the level of farm their mid player has and when they're going to pick up a hex.   As a mid? Well generally you'll need to build into something like a hex or a shivas guard once you've gained your survivability except if you're a hero like storm or invoker or whatever in which case you're more reliant on a bkb or a refresher or something. But maybe you're not up against a team of strong disables so bkb doesnt really need to be an item you pick up so maybe you can buy a manta instead because they have a clinkz so they're relying on his orchid to keep you out of commission.   As a
My mom was on good terms with my boyfriend when she first met him but after a disagreement during our second meeting, where my boyfriend defended me after my mom belittled me and my ambitions, she now thinks that he's a disrespectful asshole.   I happen to have a very stubborn mother. Irritatingly so.. she's so stubborn I can barely remember her ever apologizing for anything she's ever done. She's called me a bitch, a pig (in front of my boyfriend) and she's also slapped me on the face. In addition, she likes to be in control of everything (who I'm friends with, where I go, what degree I should pursue). She would always say how my friends are liberal hippies and how I am a disrespectful daughter for moving out of state and leaving my parents behind. My sister is the favorite daughter because she does everything my mom says and cracks under pressure from her. She heavily criticizes my appearance and tells me to keep up with my looks or my boyfriend will leave me. When I start crying about how I'm afraid of him leaving me, she tells me what's wrong with you and your self confidence? (like wtf) My boyfriend noticed that she would never compliment my intelligence (she never has). My Dad's more reserved and underspoken, and I get along with him better, but he has differing beliefs to me and attitudes and opinions I don't understand. So it doesn't make for a perfect relationship.   So basically she thinks that my boyfriend is persuading me to not go to law school because he has 'low self-esteem' and wants to get ahead of me. All my boyfriend told her was that I should think very hard about what grad degree I should be pursuing and that I should be only going to the best law schools so I don't end up in a mountain of debt. My mom thinks I should get into any shitty school that takes me because she assumes I can never get into an ivy league and it doesn't matter where I get my JD from.   She also doesn't respect my boyfriend because of his occupation. She has told me that he is a loser and he has not done anything in his life for a 27 year old. She used to tell me that I should marry someone with lots of money instead of marrying out of love. My dad, on the other hand, respects him because when we immigrated to the US, he worked at a gas station before studying to become a doctor. He also respects my boyfriend and my decision to be with him.   My boyfriend and I both have our undergrad degrees from top schools and he works in private education (he has his own business) and I work in finance (she thinks I'm a glorified accountant with no prestige). He makes a very good income for people our age. He's already saved up 50 grand for grad school. We are both studying hard now to get into a good law school.   Anyway, their came a point where my bf mentioned to my cousin that he thinks my mom is too controlling of everything I do and that I should be able to stick up for myself. My cousin told his mom (even after he agreed he would not tell anyone) and she told my mom and all hell broke loose. Now she keeps texting me how he's a manipulator, liar, bad influence, only wants me for my body lol. Oh and, she texted me that he's from SATAN (yes in all caps).   Honestly, I knew my mom would eventually say weird shit. When we were at our 2 month mark of dating, my mom would harass the shit out of me and say things like 'why hasn't he asked you to marry him yet, is he a player?'(my mom got married after knowing my father for 3 months). We have now been together for a year and everything is going great, I'm living with him and we are talking about marriage and kids. YET, my mom insists that I'm his trial wife or something. Good god, he just wants to be financially stable before starting a family with me. His parents want to meet mine but she insists that she will not ever introduce herself or talk to them until we are engaged.   A couple of days ago, she sent me another one of her rants and I got so pissed that I didn't even answer her calls. She threatened me by saying that she is now disowning me. My sister thinks I should call her and apologize and explain everything but honestly I'm so sick and tired of her bullshit that I don't feel like talking to her anytime soon.
Not sure if this counts as even bad.  Dated a girl for about 6 months.  It was for the duration a pretty good relationship.  It ended with her breaking my heart pretty much and not in a good way.  The general consensus between pretty much anyone that had both sides of the story was that she was a bitch and not a good person.  Basically she cheated and was kind of childish about a lot of things.  It has been a year since that happened.  Throughout that time she lost almost all friends she had while we were dating due to her turning into a psycho.  We had texted a few times during this time.  Most of them were her asking why I did certain things.  I was careful not to say anything to set her off.  I didn't blame her for anything that happened.  The texting became kind of nicer.  She finally moved back to the city I live for a job and we happened to be out one night and ran into each other.  Mind you she was still dating the guy she left me for.  We are drunk.  We don't kiss.  She comes back to my place and she holds steady and sleeps on the couch.  But I knew her.  She was already on the path to liking me again.  It wasn't even 2 weeks later and she was single (cheated on her bf with one of his friends).  We decide to hang out.  We take our dogs to the dog park and end up back at her place just hanging out.  Within a couple days we were having sex again.  We were talking about feelings.  I had mentioned still being in love with her.  Lots of feelings being thrown around.  That has since calmed down and we haven't hung out in a week or so.  By the way, she's kinda bat shit crazy and has no idea how to handle a relationship.  She is childish, immature, and above all fucking stupid.  The bad thing I'm doing?  I really don't even like her as a person.  She's kinda fun in the sack and she's ridiculously hot.  That's literally all she has going for her.  I'm having my fun time.  When I get to a point in my life where I feel I will never want to have sex with her again, I will tell her just what I feel about her.  I will tell her how I used her.  How I lied to her.  She is a horrible person.  She deserves it.
Because historians fear that this may be a proverbial powder keg. Clearly there is some tension lying between between Russia and NATO. China is a wildcard -- will they take NATO's side (unlikely) or back Russia (would legitimize Russia's cause). Democracy is looking weak ( Economist  had a brilliant 6-page report on why: basically China is making a damn convincing case you don't need democracy to succeed). See the assassination of Franz Ferdinand that started WWI -- when it was happening I doubt the average Joe saw the killing of the Austro-Hungarian throne as the start of an international war.   It is unlikely that it happens, obviously. But there is a chance and it is worth thinking about. Who knows what can happen? If Russia is aggressive enough, NATO will have to take action, and chances are economic sanctions won't do anything. Putting boots on the ground, and while it may not be WWIII, it would be a serious military interaction.
So I have had a crush on this girl all semester and I finally scored a date with this beauty. We went out, we had a great time bowling with her friends and their S/O. Her best friend said she is into me and even smiles at the mention of my name.   This is great and I'm super happy about it, but I don't know what to do next. I'd like to eventually call her my girlfriend, but I dont know how to get there.
2007 - Living with roommate who is female and very attractive. Before moving in, we got to know each other a bit over the summer and had a decent friendship going in. Upon move in, before our other roommate moved in, we spent some alone time together watching tv, cooking, etc. All very platonic.   Fast forward 2 mo - habits formed, and we spend a decent amount of time together, but there is always a bit of tension, sexually. One night we had a bottle of wine between the two of us, and during a particularly steamy moment of television she stretches and her boobs (big nice ones too) jiggle through her tank top and no bra. Couldn't help but notice, and she noticed me noticing. She smiled, and I did too a bit awkwardly. A few mins later she does it again, and this time we both know she did it to get my attention. She leaned back kind of seductively, and says "This scene is kinda hot" and smiles. I agree, and we watch TV a bit longer. Nother steamy scene comes on, and I look at her out the corner of my eye and catch her watching me. I turned, smiled, and asked her if she was thinking what I was thinking. Turns out, yes she was. So we scoot closer to each other, just to get our bodies touching. My heart's pounding a bit at this point, and I have an erection just raging. She leaned against me and put her hand on my thigh - I adjust to make the angle a little easier for access. Then she nuzzles my neck and slides her hand onto my rager and comments on how she was waiting for this. We kissed and then made out for a bit til it was kinda hot and heavy. Lots of heavy petting and she's getting very wet through her Sofies (cheerleading shorts). I slide one side of the crotch to the side to find she's not wearing underwear. At that point, I was gung ho for it, and slip a finger just inside. She starts moaning against my neck, and my finger goes deeper. Clothes come off and we are having a hell of a time on the couch, she's dripping wet and I'm a steel rod. We keep working it up, building to climax and she gets on top so I can play with her clit more effectively. As we're going and going, we get louder and louder. Right at the point of climax (which was hot cause we both came at the same time) our roommate walks in the door. Doors around the corner so she grabs a blanket to cover us while still mounting me. We finish in a sweaty, trembling heap, body fluids on the couch. Roommate looks disgusted and goes into his room muttering about living with a couple. Once spent, we go back to watching something less...erotic...and laugh about it. Fucked a few more times that year when we were both horny and apologized to the roommate. Fortunately, the apt came furnished so the complex replaced the couch the next morning so no one would suffer and we kept to our rooms after that.   Overall, a good experience, and we ended up dating for a while but never could resume a friendship after. Today, she's married w/ 2 beautiful kids, and I have very fond memories.
So this friend of mine has grown more and more emotionally needy and constantly uses me to gain attention. She's flirty when drinking, complains to me about not being to find a man, and constantly mentioning she feels overweight in an effort to get me to disagree with her.   I'm at the end of my rope, I'm being treated like a boyfriend with none of the payoff... and the time has come to put an end to it. A few weeks ago I started treating her like "one of the guys" and teasing more, and she took it too seriously and freaked out on me. I want her to be aware that I'm there for her as a friend, but I am not someone she can dump her emotions on.   Is there any way I can do this without her thinking I'm an asshole? And for context: she is not my girlfriend, and my actual girlfriend does not like her hanging around me. I've brought up her behavior twice and she insists she only thinks of us as friends. I have however been asked by several people, close friends and some I just met, if we are together. So I'm not crazy, she is in fact treating me boyfriendy.
Creationist here!  Here's the thing: I do understand evolution (at least in outline form), but I don't buy it - but neither do I buy so-called "creation science."  The catch for me is, I think that science's insistence on empiricism is weak epistemology and circular reasoning; moreover, this reasoning's invalidity is especially apparent when scientists want to move to philosophical materialism from their positivism.  Here's the catch: science says, "We'll accept statement x as valid if and only if x is objectively observable and repeatable."  From there, the move is, "We've only found things that are objectively observable and repeatable - nothing else must exist!"  But if a divine Being does exist, or really anything supernatural exists and can interact with the material universe, we would expect  precisely  events that are not repeatable, and may not be observable to all!
yepyep. My point was that I love working for Gamestop and I love helping people find the right game and enjoy video games.   Alot of people that Gamestop hires in general tend to be good sales people that are kind of detached from the "gaming scene". Where the closest thing they really get to is Angry Birds, or very casual Call of Duty, etc(like the major, AAA big sellers). So not exactly the people you would categorize as fans of video games.
Wohoo, here we go, you can pick up all your pitchforks, torches and BFG-s, because for me this game is pretty "this is everything?".   Let's start with clarifying, that i don't think this is the worst game ever, heck, it's not even bad, but neither is it good.   Now, after all these bullshit, here is my biggest problem: It's so frickin repetitive! Move two minutes, "OH GOD DEMONIC FORCES, LOCKDOWN, KILL DEM", you kill them, move another two minutes, a little bit of story, "OH GOD DEMONIC FORCES...", you kill them. And for the entire game you repeat this! And these "lockdown scenes" aren't that short, you're stuck in a small room for ten minutes fighting the constantly spawning foes. This isn't the tiniest bit doom-like! And that could be a good thing (modernization is important), but it slows down the game, and destroys the mood.   Spoilers: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE GAME OR YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING YET   And the ending... oh the ending, you fought the vile spider-mastermind, you have the crucible, the hell portal is closed, oh yeah, but then?! This weird robotic guy comes snatches the crucible, and the game straight flips you off, when he transforms it into a sword then walks off screen, while you're teleported into the-fuck-knows-where...   /rant
Its my first bike, so I have no point of reference, but its not that bad as far as roughness unless the roads are truly terrible (which is certainly the case in some areas of NYC).  Its something I am just used to I guess.  That being said, I have a friend with a Langster (which consequently is what made me decide to get a fixed gear) and its certainly more comfortable/smooth.  I actually went to the bike store to buy a Langster, but after testing both I ended up with the Sonik.  For pure speed/power/acceleration -- the Sonik is a beast.  The torque on this thing is incredible.  Practical in NYC?  Not even close -- but I still love riding it and wouldn't choose a Langster over it had I the chance to go back.  The Langster Pro wasn't an option, I just don't feel that brakeless is safe in NYC (brake mounts are not drilled on it).  I tried brakeless on my Sonik for a week and was close to bailing multiple times due to cars or pedestrians.  That kind of speed + no brakes is a bad combination in my opinion.
My roommate this year (freshman year) is a shy awkward kid who speaks in a falsetto. Due tot his he has certain shortcomings of which he makes up for by following me everywhere I go, and latching on to everything I do. He does this so much, in fact, that if I say I'm going to the bathroom and I take too long on the toilet he strolls in to check I'm still there. He doesn't have any friends that aren't mutual friends of ours that I introduced him to. Any and all hints that I would like to be alone or he isn't invite are ignore or taken as insult. And when I don't invite him I always have  reason; me and a select group of people have plans, I'm trying to have a private conversation or there is not room in a car. If he doesn't know where I am he either sits in our room with the door closed, or wanders around campus looking for me. I feel bad flat out telling him to stop following me because I don't want to ruin his college experience as hes a quiet and reserved kid. I know that if I tell him to fuck off he'll sit in the room and resent me. Alternatively, my time has been not at all what I expected due to my constant tail making any and all interactions wit new people immediately awkward. I want to meet new people and have new experiences, but he is preventing me from doing these things.
Hey, 30 year old dude, just got a girlfriend for the first time since I was 19 (woop woop) We are cross-cultural, I live in her country but we function in my language and I'm slowly learning hers but it will take me a long time.   What should I be looking out for? What should I over think and not over think re: new relationship/noob status as well as cross-cultural communication malfunctions.   Cheers
For me, I shampoo my hair and let it sit for a minute, and during that time ill wash my face. Rinse both, put in conditioner, let it sit,  brush teeth or shave a leg or pits,  rinse out,  finish the shaving if not done, body wash, sing off key, rinse,  and done.
because you're essentially "if you don't know about something that i think is cool then you're an idiot and stupid".   this is a much better approach:   also "take back your words"? CurtR didn't say anything negative about the station, just about the way this information was posted here.
This is probably going to end up being a longwinded post with questions and complaints about the CTMP.   On 15 APR my SMI sent all of the MS16 MS3s an email with instructions on how to complete the COMPASS and Cadet File. Within this email / powerpoint attachment is the following information:   "Upon completion of the COMPASS, Cadets/ECP 2LTs will receive personal feedback regarding their talent strengths and weaknesses for the twenty common talents that are prioritized by the seventeen basic branches.  Cadets’ talents will be assessed relative to their peers in the MS III cohort across the country.  COMPASS feedback will be delivered personally to Cadets via the CTMP website NLT 05 JUN.  An example of the feedback is shown below."   No feedback thus far on the COMPASS.   On 01 JUN our SMI sent us an email including deficiencies for each component of the talent management program for our brigade (5th). There are many of us on these lists that completed each component (with our screens showing us that we've submitted the module or cadet file), yet we are still a NOGO for whatever reason.   Also, we're 99% certain our SMI did not complete any individual talent evaluations for us, so there is definitely a justification for us being NOGOs on this.   This is particularly concerning due to the fact that this is apparently going to impact accessions pretty heavily.   From the email chain forwarded by our SMI:   In September, USACC will close the Talent Management Website and pull/compile all of the data into the cadets' board file (this is what the board will see in October); they will continue to conduct branching via the same process we used in FY15 (pre-branching and DABM).  Once that is complete USACC will then start using the Talent data (Branch Talent Scores) provided by OEMA validate the branch the Cadets received in normal branching via their Talent scores.  If the Cadet is a good talent match that will be the end of the process.  If the Cadet is not a good talent match then the board will see that Cadet board file.  The board will make the final determination on basic branch for the Cadet.  The board will continue to conduct all branch detailing. To minimize confusion, USACC will still use CCIMM database this year for OML and branching data. Since the Talent Management Website is a new system and is coming on line late, USACC will need to continue to use the CCIMM database for all data inputs used for the Outcomes Metrics List (OML) Model and for input of branch preferences, ADSOs desired, etc..  If the use of the Talent Management Website is successful for the Fy16 Cohort, then it will be used as the long term plan to move away from CCIMM and into the Talent Management Website for all branching inputs/decisions in the future.
F19, committed relationship, currently using NuvaRing.   alright here's the skinny. i checked the sidebar and took Planned Parenthood's 'my method' quiz, the one that gives you options that work for you...and none of the options it gave me were viable. it gave me NuvaRing, which i already take and want to quit, the OrthoEvra patch, which is probably my current best option, and Mirena. i don't have the money for Mirena, it's just not possible in my current situation, although that's what i really want. i want to get it as soon as possible, but i can't for a while yet.   my problems with NuvaRing are that it absolutely destroyed my sex drive, and i've recently run into problems with spotting between periods and dryness. it's incredibly uncomfortable, and i'm really sick of it. the spotting isn't enough to cause me problems in my day to day life, but it's enough to be a nuisance, especially involving my sex life. it's a little more difficult to explain brown stains on the sheets than it is white ones, and i'd really like to be able to receive oral at some point without making my boyfriend gag from the taste of blood.   what i'm looking for is something that's pretty low-maintenance. NuvaRing is perfect for its convenience, only having to deal with it once a month, it's relatively cheap, and i can pretty much forget about it most of the time. i was on the pill for a short while, but it's just not a logistical possibility with the way my life works. i can't possibly take a pill every day, it's just not safe. i'd never feel comfortable relying on it.  I don't want to use condoms, because they hurt my boyfriend (yes, we've shopped around. no, it didn't help.). it would be nice if i could control when my period happens (either by switching it around or skipping it entirely) because my boyfriend and i are long-distance, but if that's not a possibility, it won't kill me.
I'd assume just about everything on your network is secretly conspiring against you..   1) SSLStrip - Literally strips the SSL from the page before it gets to you, replaces the favicon with it's own provided lock, and you'd have to check the URL before logging in anywhere.   2) Ettercap - Ettercap provides a pretty quick config edit that will allow you to send out your own custom certificates instead of website ones. This will provide a popup though informing the end-user that the certificate is not valid. Just don't accept it with the default 'Permanently accept this certificate' since that will make any certificates signed by the attacker valid.   3) FakeAP/Airbase - You can easily setup a fake wireless access point that can mimic another one, and if the attacker is able to provide a better signal power you'll make the jump to the evil access point transparently. Also, the ability to send deauth packets with Aireplay that will cause a client to think he needs to reconnect immediately.   4) Metasploit/BeEF - If someone is on your network though, they can use Ettercap to add a hidden iFrame that can check for all potential browser vulnerabilities including ones from your plugins installed. It can also run these same checks against the open services running on your system.   5) DNS Spoofing - They can also spoof the DNS server reply, and make you believe that you're on an entirely different site. An example of this to the extreme would be the DNS bug from a few years back.   6) Hamster/Ferret - For completion sake of, what I consider, the SSL suite, is plain and simple session hijacking. Shows no signs to the end user, but doesn't give away your password. Just full control over any account your cookie passes through the attackers logs, and your session is still valid a la you didn't log out. Oh! Firesheep would be the new recent one in this category. It pretty much ignited the movement towards more user-friendly session hijacking (that's a really funny sentence for some reason..)   Eh, don't worry too much about it :D You'll be fine.   I have a strong wireless password, 'ohmypl_as dontcrackm ', and I look at my logs for irregularities every now and then.   If you're on a public network, then yeah it'd be a good idea to go through a VPN or something if you're going to be logging into to check your email. It's also a very good idea to have different passwords for sites, and don't reuse your email password anywhere else. I use LastPass for it, some people recommend KeePass, and others recommend post it notes securely placed near your system so you don't lose them.   If you have SSH on your router then you probably have DD-WRT installed, and a VPN server can be installed on there. Then you can just connect to your own router back home when out of town.   *Censored wireless password
Yes! Satoshi Kon (RIP) shows exactly why anime can be so powerful an artistic medium.   Unlike film, anime--and animation in general--is not limited by physics or other earthly constraints. Anime can portray scenes that are literally impossible in live-action.   This means the anime director has ABSOLUTE control over the work. He/she can pack an anime with symbolism and allegory almost to the level a piece of literature can.   Satoshi Kon takes advantage of this. Everyone should see "Paranoia Agent." It's beautiful and disturbing; it prods into the dark side of modern society. It's meta as fuck too. It is also packed with symbolism and imagery; one could easily write an analytical paper focusing on what Kon does.
I really don't think it was too bad given the conflict of that game. Each of the three games can be seen as questioning a certain ideal.     When faced against slavery: Is it better to die fighting or serve for your survival? The first game is a bit iffy, though. I don't think it knows whether it wants to be about this or the frustrations of dealing with a bureaucracy.     A. Every time you talk to Saren he emphasizes this: If we help them, if we are useful, then we get to stay alive. Isn't this better than death?   B. Every time you speak to the Council, they never want to believe the Reaper threat. To them, you are just hunting down a rogue Spectre. Even if they believed, what do they do? The galaxy could erupt into chaos if they acted in great measures like Shepherd wanted to.   C. The Genophage: The question in this instance was whether curing the genophage and become 'slaves' to Saren was a viable option. Each game approaches the genophage from a different angle and it fit the theme for this one.   D. The Thorian: Was exposing a colony to mind-control worth studying them? Is it such a terrible deal if it does nothing more than cause migraines? Is it  really  slavery?   E. The Rachni: The 'taken too far' scenario. The key to saving a once thought extinct race. Was it right to make them a compliant slave species? If the rachni in this scenario had been raised correctly by the queen and the same incident occurred, would it be justified?     How pragmatic can a group be before they become evil? There are another few ways you can ask this, but I think that question hits the general idea.      A. Shepherd has been brought from the dead to defeat the Reapers, an already questionable action that is brought up many, many times during the game. Hell, the Illusive Man himself told you they didn't mess with your brain just so you could believe you aren't being manipulated.   B. The final decision you make in the campaign is the paradigm of this: Do you destroy or salvage the Collector ship? You hunt down a Reaper affiliate and once you have the ship, is it too dangerous to study? Is it better to destroy and figure out a different way?   C. Jack's loyalty mission is another great example is because it was when it was taken too far. They wanted to create the best biotic, but did it through horrible experiments on children.   D. Getting Grunt is also a good one because he was made to be the perfect Krogan. He was in a tank and a wildcard. Would it have been better to eject him? Put him through more tests? Is it okay to still use him for fighting when he was created the way he was, "on the tops of a thousand dead krogan"?   E. Mordin. Just all of Mordin's story.   F. Tali's loyalty mission. Her father wanted active geth in order to study them better. A noble decision but very dangerous. It's difficult to say if he could be a bad guy or not.   G: The Genophage: In Mass Effect 2, the question was whether the Genophage was the right option and the right thing to do. Was it the correct course of action? Is it really the best outcome? Does everyone really win?     The third game deals with what AI actually means. Should an AI be considered a living being? What's the cut-off point? Also, a lot of the game deals with how society should act during a war. This is seriously the entire basis for the renegade/paradigm. Does the military take priority or civilians?     A. EDI. Basically, everything. Yes, this was a theme in the second game, but it really takes the forefront here. She gets a body and the question comes up, is she capable of love? Can a relationship between her and Joker feasible? Can any AI feel emotions?   B. Legion and Tali. Once again, a little in the second but really comes out in the second. Do the geth deserve destruction? Should an AI be respected as a living being?   C. Shepherd technically is part of both worlds. A lot of his/her body is synthetic just as much as it is organic. So what is Shepherd? Both? Neither? Perhaps that's why he/she gets to choose the fate of organics and synthetics.   D. If I were to list every instance of military vs. civilian conflict in the game I'd be here for hours.   E. The Genophage: Curing the Genophage is a  giant  decision and would shape the course for an entire species and even perhaps the entire galaxy. In order to save the universe, is it worth curing it even if they become a giant threat later? Is the safety of the universe worth curing and putting civilians at risk later?   Of course, these themes are revisited and later games and to an extent the repercussions on the answer to one question to another (think Javik: They enslaved every race they encountered and through that, had peace).   They did have to change some details to better fit the themes. Take the geth. In the first game it is stressed that they get smart the closer they are to each other. Legion is comprised of many geth. So what is a single geth? A single platform as similarly described in the first game or like Legion, many geth in a single platform? It can be explained with a little thought accepting both but it is never explained.
WorldUnity](   Before I start please let me apologize for posting this request in a subreddit not entirely focused towards the goal I am trying to achieve.  I am posting this same message in quite a few subreddits for the greater good.  Whether you are into technology, politics or anything else fun to browse on reddit we will all be affected if we don't start acting soon.  This is simply a hello and a request to join me and other redditors in making our mark on the world   >>I am tired of the ways of the world.  I am tired of those in power using it nefariously.  I am tired of sitting back and doing nothing.  This one thing, small as it may be, is my attempt at true change.  It may start as a subreddit, it may move to it’s own website one day but it’s power is in numbers and the creativity and imagination of the people who join with me to fight against corporate power and those who wish to take away what makes us free.   >>I have started many subreddits in the past few months.  These subreddits are designed to allow us to talk and discuss politics with those who are in the same congressional districts as each other.  I would like each of you to join the district subreddit that you belong to.  In each district subreddit we will post on the sidebar all elected officials, when they are up for reelection and if they are running opposed or unopposed.  Any other important information will be added as well.  These district subreddits will be moderated by those who actually live in that district.  We will find a way for you to verify that soon.  I have had many ideas of things that we could do to make change but I believe two heads are better than one and reddit has a lot more heads than just two.  With your ideas we can really do something great.   >>Not all of the subreddits have been created yet.  If you try to join your districts subreddit and it doesn’t exist, make it.  I will however need to add myself as a moderator to that subreddit and then delete and re-add you.  This is simply to make sure that the wrong people are not moderating these subs.  I will not allow excessive deletion of posts or banning of members.  I will do my best to keep those who wish to harm these subreddits from moderating them.  This will not be an easy task but I will remove people from moderation anytime the subreddit feels it is necessary.  This is a place for us to talk about ideas and follow through with those ideas.  The only thing that will get your comments or threads removed from these subreddits will be those who are only here to joke around.  This is a serious time in our lives.  We have many places to go to joke around.  Let’s not make that place here.   >>I will continue to make the subreddits for each congressional district.  Since reddit has been down today I haven’t been able to create many of them.  I do however have a subreddit for each state (in the US), each continent and the world as a whole.  If you have something important that you want to post in your districts sub and also want to move it up to the state sub, do it.  If you want to put it in each subreddit (district, state, country, continent and world) do it.  We will let up and downvotes do it's work at that point.  I will only be working on the US at the moment.  I don’t understand how everything works in other countries.  If you want to help with other parts of the world please do so and message me with your ideas.  This is only a blueprint.  This is only a beginning.  I am willing to listen and I’m willing to let these subreddits change when necessary.  I just want things better.  I want to be happy to bring children in this world one day.  I want to be confident that they will be free to live a life they are happy with.   >>I ask that you be patient with the sidebars.  This will take a lot of work but I want each sidebar to easily display all important information that reddit thinks is necessary.  I would like to have a mission statement.  I have one in mind but I would like to discuss.  This would be added to the sidebar.  If you see any misspellings or grammar mistakes please let me know.  If I leave out anything, please let me know.  I want this to look good, I want to messages to be easy to remember and I want this to work.  I don’t think it’s time for us to choose a politician to destroy.  I don’t think it’s time to choose two or even discuss making sure we choose politicians from both sides of aisle.  I think it’s time we look at each state and make it our own again.  If the state doesn’t like the politician we remove that politician from power.  If the state doesn’t like that a politician is running unopposed we find someone to run against him.  I live in Kentucky.  I want Mitch McConnell gone.  He doesn’t fight for me.  He doesn't have my best interests in mind.  There are many in this state that think the same way.  However this isn't about one state or one politician.  This is about all of us.   >>Many of you live in states that disagree with their leaders.  These leaders work for us and it’s time they are reminded.  Please join [/WorldUnity]( and join all the subreddits that pertain to you.  For those of you who want to help moderate I could use the help.  For those of you with information about your district, state or country POST IT!   >>Thanks for taking the time to read this.  I am not a great writer and I apologize if this doesn't’ have a good flow to it.  However I think we all want the same thing.  If you think something like this will help please join.  Reddit may not be the whole world but we are a good portion of it.  We can make change.
When I was in year 6 I was a very white kid and didn't have any Asian friends, I was in a laptop class and this Asian guy in my class changed everyone's desktop background to a picture with 4 blonde hair guys and a dragon. I than asked him wtf he was doing and he responded with "changing everyone's desktop to dragon ball". I asked him what dragon ball is he responded with it an anime and I was so confused I didn't know what anime was he told me to watch it so I did and loved the first episode. After 2 years I finished the series and loved it ,and I finally found out who the 4 blonde guys were (goku, vegeta, gohan, trunks) now I'm in year 10 going to 11 and I love anime all thanks to dragon ball. It shaped me to how I am. Sometimes act more Asian than all my Asian friends. Thanks dragon ball!
I just talked to an economist at the World Bank.  American employees at the World Bank and the IMF pay full taxes, just like anybody else.   The US government has negotiated that foreign workers working for the World Bank and IMF do not have to pay income tax to the US in large part to keep them headquartered in Washington, as opposed to London, Vienna, or several other suggested headquarters.   For foreign employees, the World Bank/IMF then deduct the amount that an American would pay in taxes from their salary.  So if there is a job posting with a salary of $80,000, if an American got the job they might be paid $80,000 and owe $20,000 to Uncle Sam, and if a foreigner got the job, they would simply be paid $60,000 so they are compensated the same.  This is a vast oversimplification.  The US wins because they get to keep two major organizations headquartered in DC, overall certainly a net boon in taxes and economic stimulus.  American workers win because they are contribute taxes to the economy, and are still compensated fairly with their colleagues.  Foreign workers win because they don't have to pay US taxes, and yet there's no animosity because everyone is compensated the same.
Seconded. Keep in mind this pertains to AAA studios:   Game Designer positions are highly coveted and widely misunderstood. For a systems game designer, you'd want a really strong foundation in a wide array of areas - The Art of Game Design has a great list of potential areas of study. Off the top of my head you'd want software engineering, psychology + cog sci, economics, HCI / interaction design, math, etc. As much as you care to absorb really - but do not miss out on the software engineering part. It's one thing to conceptualize and design a system, but another to prototype or implement it in code. Most game design positions I see listed require some coding expertise (or scripting, at least) so that you can work in the game engine directly at least part of the time.   The majority of game designers I know are either programmers (with 4+ years of university), producers/managers (also with 4+ years university, usually), or art directors (2+ years of art school) who moved into the role after working for some time in the industry. However, I have heard from colleagues at other studios that they do hire interns or new grads right from game design programs. Having said that, the number of applicants is far, far greater than the number of positions available.   I have no first hand experience at the schools you listed, but from what I have read and seen in the wild they will miss the benchmark you want to hit. Be wary of game design certificates/programs that focus too much on the tools of the moment (writing GDDs, making fancy spreadsheets, etc.) instead of teaching foundational skills and the process of game design itself.
Hello CPB.   I've been recently playing with better control on all my hunter subclasses and decided to take off the Jordans for some testing. Apparently, BC jump is still pretty decent without Bones! I was shocked tbf.   I always played blink since Y1 and love it. I never ran anything else because I love the tarantella in Y2 and better control seemed worthless without bones.   But, one day, I was rewatching sweats from my clan and one of our best players was running better control without exotics and making it look pretty good.   (check it out here:  starting @ 03.58.57)   Now, my points to support this:   -Blink is currently in its weakest state ever IMO. Very slow weapon readiness, no total control over movement, cooldown, yadda yadda.   Its still pretty good for evasive maneuvers or closing gaps quickly, but the lack of vertical utility kills it for me. TLW e.g. is great in the air and it can't be used mid blink.   -Triple jump is good, but you can only move in a straight line basically, making you a not so difficult target.   Of course BC will never be as good without Bones as it is with, but if you want to run something else - tarantella, symbiote, CoAL, whatever - but don't want to use triple jump or more importantly, Blink, try to practice for some matches with better control. You might just like it like I did.
Hey man,   A few years ago, I was poor. Like, tried to squeeze the last few drops out of my motorcycle tank so I didn't have to fill up poor. That bit me in the ass and I ended up stranded on the highway at 11 at night, pushing my bike to the next exit so I could spend the last bit of pocket change I had to get home.   A semi saw me and pulled over. Being the incredibly naive kid I was, I was sitting there hoping "oh god, please don't stab me".   While not being able to speak that much English, this fantastic good samaritan helped me load my motorbike up into his cab and drove me to the next gas station. Already super thankful, as I was unloading my bike, he gave me a $20 for gas and food.   Please accept my gratitude in proxy for this kind stranger on 18 wheels.
Hey TwoX, so I just found out that I'm a few weeks pregnant with my ex boyfriend's child. We did not end up on good terms at all and over a year ago, we ended up in this same situation. I ended up telling him that time and we got back together. I had a miscarriage at 23 weeks and he snuck out of my house and didn't talk to me for 6 months afterwards. He constantly complained about being a father at such a young age (he was 19).   This time, I want to give it up for adoption.  There's not a doubt in my mind, but I don't know if I should tell him. He's 21 now and honestly, I doubt his maturity has changed.   Help?
So, about 7 months ago, I got into a spot of trouble with my parents. I had been doing some... Questionable things on the internet, and I received due punishment, namely no internet for 5 months. After that, I received severely limited internet access; this was monitored by a program called 'K9 web supervisor'. That lasted all of a week, after which they let me back onto reddit. [hooray!!!]   However,  they did not remove the aforementioned program. From what I've gathered, this program is what broke synchtube, minecraft, and livestream. So, for the past seven months, I have not been able to successfully attend or host a stream.   This brings me to the meat of this post;  mum  finally  got rid of the program about five minutes ago! I'm  free  again! It's such a great feeling to know that;     I've earned my parent's trust again     I can watch streams with y'all again     I CAN PLAY MINECRAFT       So yeah...
Hey guys,   Lately I decided to try something new and picked Vayne to play some ADC. I was really shocked with my skills (I'm a silver scrub :P), but what I noticed was that I didn't know what to do after laning phase was over. I tried not to do anything stupid (vaynespotters would be disappointed, no going in 1v4 :v), so I stayed in one of the side lanes, farming and pushing when at least 4 enemies were visible somewhere on the map, or with my team (I got a few kills, but died more, lack of mechanics, I know, I need practice). Somehow I was unsure about what I was doing all the time.
Like i said I loved the game (and zooey) but i absolutely hated the dialogue. I cringed anytime anybody opened there mouth.  But i see what you mean, I am just wondering if anyone else is just not coming out and just saying "hey the dialogue sucked" just because the constant praise the game gets.
Ultimately I would like to end up at either the NCAA or NFL level, but I'm unsure of what my first step should be to get into the coaching field.   I graduated from college with a B.S. in psychology 10 years ago, and have worked mainly in retail and tech support ever since.  I have a small amount of coaching experience with Pop Warner and flag football from before I graduated, but I haven't had an actual paid position anywhere.  I essentially need to start from scratch.   I see three different paths to try: get certified to teach and start at the high school level, apply for internships at college and professional programs, or go back to school in a sports related major.  There are benefits and drawbacks to each path, and I can only choose one to start.   My main concern with starting at the high school level is being able to transition to a higher level once I've gained experience.  Do college coaches hire people from the high school ranks?  If so, how much experience is typical?   If I apply for internships, what kind of qualifications will be necessary?  How often do coaches bring in people with basically no experience to work on a staff?  How would I make myself stand out from the other people applying for similar positions?   If I go back to school, what should I major in?  AFAIK there aren't any classes to take for coaching.  Are there classes, volunteer credits, or extracurricular activites that could give me the opportunity to work with the football team and coaching staff?   Is there another avenue that I'm missing?  I would definitely be interested in learning about other options to get into the coaching field.   I'm tired of working jobs where the only thing I look forward to is going home everyday; I want to do something that makes me look forward to going into work.  I love football and have such a passion for it, but my passion alone won't be enough to get me my dream career.  Help me Reddit, you're my only hope!
I've decided to man up and go for it. We've been friends for years but lately we've been getting closer. One bad thing however is that I overanalyze our interactions and assume negatively. But fuck it. I'm seeing her tomorrow, we're also meeting up with a group of friends again on thursday. My problem is that I don't know when/how to ask her. What I'm thinking of saying (not exactly) when I catch her alone tomorrow. "Hey, we should go out for coffee on thursday before we meet up with the others" Is this enough to let her know this is a date?
My wife and my best buddy's wife are both going out of town tonight and for the first time in years we're going to hang at my place and game. I have a PS3 and need some suggestions on good 2 player co-op games I can rent.   My gaming since we had our daughter has been relegated to seldom, late night single player games. So I'm out of the loop on good to player games for local play.
I honestly wish they'd bring back the quest system that was present in Morrowind, namely that you can't accept the more advanced quests without improving your character. For example, one of the first storyline quests in Morrowind required you to be level 3 before you completed it. Most of the guild quests required you to be a certain level, and to have increasingly high skill levels for skills that related to the guild.   I feel like this would really help prevent weird pacing issues that I've experienced, wherein my first character finished the game at level 18, and my second character is level 26 and maybe only halfway through the main story. In addition, I feel like a lot of the faction quests in Skyrim didn't have a lot of depth. Take The Companions for example. You join the faction, do maybe one or two odd jobs, and suddenly you're accepted into The Circle, which is supposed to be their innermost echelon? It feels like it goes by way too fast.
Disclaimer: I'm pretty new to DMing myself (DMed the starter kit, a custom campaign I made and ran from November to February but abandoned because of lack of time to write and prepare that much content).   I've started running this on Saturday after receiving the book from Amazon last week. I recommend reading Chapter 1, 2 completely, then check out Chapter 3 a bit, for what you think you might need to know for a first game. Also Chapter 6 if you're starting your players at lvl 1. Even though those quests are supposed to be for lvl 1, depending on your players, it might end up being tough for them if they're inexperienced. I almost killed one of the characters after one attack before they could even do anything. (Though they somewhat triggered the attack.)   Also make sure each character has plenty motivation for the game, give them a few hooks, and try to motivate them to fit in the setting, as the campaign is really sandbox-ish and there's not really a linear path to take, it'll be much easier to lead them through the adventure if they feel connected to the world.
Ok so a bit of background on me: I'm a shut-in. I enjoy my time alone and have never had a real relationship with anyone (I'm not sure I'd even count what I just recently got out of a serious relationship either). I've been lied to and emotionally abused by many people throughout my childhood and this led me to be a recluse, retreating into the online world, and that has been where I've stayed for many years. I'm not socially awkward and I don't have a problem with talking to members of the opposite sex or strangers, I just tend not to be in situations those come up often.   We worked together for about two years and during this time she confided many personal details that require a good level of trust. Naturally this made me respect her for sharing and allowed me to know her on a more personal level. A few months ago her abusive boyfriend and her split up. We enjoy talking to each other and she stayed late a few times and talked with me after her shifts were over just to talk to me on my shift, so I asked her out thinking she might be interested. She said yes. (Later she told me "I've liked you for a while now" and "I thought you'd ask me out") I thought "Sweet, my first girlfriend, I'm definitely going to do things right" We hung out several times but I always felt like there was a wedge between us that would just never go away, we ended up talking about this and she told me that she still had feelings for her Ex and that she felt bad that she said yes to when I asked her out saying "I didn't realize how emotionally unavailable I was when I said yes". I told her "I just want to see you happy, even if you're not with me so make whatever choice you think is best for you and just let me know whatever you decide".   I talked to my brother about how I was feeling and that she made no effort to hang-out with me or return my affection or anything that I expected to happen in a relationship, especially with someone that claims that they had feelings for me and he told me that he and his Ex broke up because he didn't pay enough attention to her but she was the type of person that never wanted to get into a conflict and wanted to talk about breaking up but wouldn't until my brother coaxed it out of her. This got me thinking that maybe my would-be GF felt trapped and wanted out of the relationship but feels bad about it (she already told me before she felt bad she said yes to me) and I don't want that so I just told her straight up that I don't want her to feel like she's trapped in this relationship and that I was receiving mixed signals from her.   She responded with "...You're being so nice and understanding and caring that I feel like a terrible person for being so on the fence about everything" and a few days later told me she thought more about what I said to her and she said that she had indeed been avoiding a personal conflict and that she still had feelings for her Ex. She also said she's been trying to "push past that because I really enjoy spending time with you and I like you but its become apparent to me that I'm not able to be in a relationship with you because I have feelings for someone else and they aren't going away. It just isn't fair to you...for what its worth you're pretty cool and I'm glad I got to know you" As I write this I feel cold and empty inside, not bitter but I feel nothing when I know I should feel something. I feel like I want to feel something but I'm just tired and uncaring. I'm a very logical individual and I like to think I'm smart, and I'd rather this girl just tell me something like "you're ugly and a piece of shit" than "Sorry, you're nice and I'm unavailable".   How am I supposed to react to this? I don't think I was in love with her (but then again how would I know, I've never been in a relationship before) but the reason I cared for her was more than the fact I thought she was one of the most attractive people I've ever met. It's that she wasn't shallow and she had real issues that she confided in me. We both have a level of trust in each other that I've never had or felt before with anyone else outside of a few select members of my family. She made me feel like going out to see her and bettering myself as a person (in multiple ways). I feel like I'll never find that again and I can't stand people that are fake or obnoxious like the typical bar/club crowd of drunk people/students that I see every night. Combine this with my shut-in lifestyle where I hardly meet anyone new IRL and I now feel like relationships are just meaningless and pointless. Not that everyone's are, just that they are that way for me. Is this a normal attitude? If it isn't then how should I go about changing my attitude? Also: How would you react to this? Like I said I'm new to this whole thing but I've never thought things would be so ideal to me in a girlfriend until I met this person and now that I have an idea how she is/was than everyone else I'm in a relationship with will now be worse in my eyes or compared to her (which is obviously unfair).   I know there are a few other things I've forgotten to mention but I've already wrote enough, sorry for this being so long. Thanks for any advice. At the very least it's slightly comforting to put a small amount of my thoughts into words on a page.
Hi r/relationships,   I went to an all-male high-school and wasn't very social because I was very busy with a little business type thing and stayed home a lot. I had lots of good friends at school, but I never hung out with them much and as a result I never really met many girls. Towards the end of senior year I did get out more and really fell for a girl I met and became good friends with, but despite my efforts she didn't reciprocate the feelings. I just thought that I was really bad with girls because I was inexperienced.   However, after my first few months in college I've learned that I'm actually quite good with girls. Lots of girls on my floor seem to like me (I don't like anyone on my floor though), and I've been told a few have crushes on me. Apparently I'm endearing in a way, which isn't traditionally attractive I guess but whatever. I've had decent success at parties as well, but nothing that serious. There is a very, very cute girl I met through a mutual friend who told a friend that I am "adorable, really cute" and said she would have "hooked up" with me the night we met but she later got a little too drunk and didn't remember anything and went home. There is a good chance I'll see her again next semester through this friend.   Anyway, I know this is too forward of thinking, but this has me getting excited about the potential of getting a girlfriend. I know it's a bit early to think about that with this girl, but she is the exact kind of girl I am very attracted to: super nice and sweet, funny, and more "cute" looks than hot. Side note: she doesn't really strike me as the kind of girl that would "hook-up" like that. In general though, I'm thinking about a girlfriend, not specifically her, as I've never had one.   Here's my main point though. If I had a girlfriend, I would want to do all kinds of things that I fear would be considered clingy or over-the-top. I know girls like creative dates and I'd like to take her to this rooftop I found where you can see the soccer games from really far away, or maybe send her flowers or leave her notes periodically to brighten her day. Stuff like that. I wouldn't go over the top like this all the time, but I would really enjoy being able to do things like this for a girl. I don't know why. Maybe because it's because I've never had a girlfriend, but I just think it would be great to do this. However, would this be a little weird or clingy? I know my friends with girlfriends don't really do this.
One of the biggest arguments against the DJJ theory that I've seen is "Why would Lucas spend an entire movie dropping incredibly subtle hints and not reveal give the payoff in the same movie?"   This completely ignores the fact that he already did it with Vader being Luke's father in ANH.  ANH is chocked full of hints that were so subtle they were easily ignored without hindsight and that's without even knowing there'd be a second movie.
A while ago, people were irritated about other people posting their new gear without descriptions and wanted a way to filter that out using  Reddit Enhancement Suite  or [NAD] (new amp day), then the tag doesn't work and your new gear posts are showing up on the computers of people who wanted to filter them out.   I personally have no problems with this as I love NGD posts, but it's incredibly inconsiderate to the people who just block them out rather than complain.
When you plan a "boys/girls night out" one might safely assume its not a "lets go get laid night out". Also, if they are staying at YOUR place they should not just bring some random stranger into YOUR home (without asking) AND leave you high and dry to find your own way home.
I once brought a girl home from a night out. I was very, very drunk.   Part way through the no pants dance, I started to sobre up, instantly realising that A)She was not the nicest of looking chicks and B) I just really wanted to go to sleep.   I then excused myself to get a drink and pretended to fall down the stairs, screaming in pain. As she came out of my room, I told her I think I had broke my arm. She said that she would ring an ambulance.   I said "no, you ring a taxi to get you, I'll wake my housemate up to take me to hospital". I then woke my housemate up and made him drive me round the block for about half an hour until we were sure she had gone.   Worst thing is...saw her in the same bar the next night, clearly no evidence of broken arm.   What a horrible person.
I read this many years ago so not sure of the source, but it was how ninjas moved silently and carefully - i.e. - if barefoot.   When moving your foot forward (slowly), brush it lightly along the ground in a sweeping half-moon arc (start inside and move outward) instead of just picking up your foot and stepping. So, you would start where your foot is and arc it out and forward to make a step.   This brushes anything out of the way that may make noise or be dangerous (leaves, sticks, broken glass).   Keep most of your weight on your back leg until you are sure of your foot placement. There are other techniques too and you should probably know more than one for different circumstances.
That's neither here nor there. We're on the verge of proving that we live in a flat universe. (Well, it's proven, but more review is being done on it - that's how science works). What that means in layman's terms: it is very possible and maybe even necessary that whenever you have true, absolute nothingness, you end up with, for lack of a better word “ somethingness". So the fact that the universe does not require a “creator" to exist is well within the realm of possibilities now.
I don't enjoy grinding a random number generator in any game.  However, so long as getting super-rare drops is not required to progress in the game, I still enjoy the game itself by simply ignoring the rare drops.  A super-rare item is not worth grinding for, but if one drops it's a pleasant surprise.   The way I think of it is like any game of chance.  I can enjoy playing card games.  I don't really enjoy them for the shuffling and dealing aspect.  People who grind the RNG are like people who are willing to reshuffle a card deck as many times as it takes so they can play the perfect hand.  Some are more clever and build machines to shuffle for them (afk farms).  I don't find that interesting or worth my time, so I don't do it.  If the game required doing that in order to progress I wouldn't play it.   It's also understandable that a lot of the new items are rare drops.  In order to make an interesting challenge like the 3-boss hamdrax, you need to put a lot of time and effort into making 3 bosses.  Coming up with actually interesting challenges is much harder than the interesting item rewards, and 1.2 added a lot of items.  There's no way to make interesting challenges for all of them, so the simple least-effort approach is just to assign a low drop-rate to the item.
Necro is a pretty unique int hero, in the sense that he really is just a tank. He just survives and lets his aura do damage over time, while providing his team with essentially endless heals.   Necro is a pretty good laning hero. His attack animation is decent, his projectile is a little slow, but last hitting on him isn't too bad. The main reason he is such a strong laner, however, is Sadist. It allows him to stay in lane pretty much indefinitely, given the player can deny/last hit well. Typically, Necros will max Death Pulse and Sadist, with one level of the aura early, and grabbing the ult whenever possible. The early level of aura provides a little bit of harassment, generally countering any base regen that a hero may have. It also allows you to get assists on kills that you might not have been participating in, whether it is because you need to farm or you are low on health. It isn't absolutely necessary, imo, but it does provide some reasonable benefits.   Necro's item build is relatively flexible. He needs to tank up, but there are a variety of ways of doing this. Early game, a lot of necro's will get soul ring, myself included, as you can pop it for the mana, instantly heal, and if timed correctly for last hits will grant you a netgain in mana. The hp and mana regen are also useful in lane, and it is easy enough to build, with two components coming from sideshop. Afterwards, tanking up becomes your priority. The usual way of doing this is to aim for a vit booster/hood or vanguard/cloak, or even a vanguard/hood. Treads are usually the way to go, although some prefer mana boots, especially if they didn't get soul ring. In my games, the build order is generally: soul ring->boots->ring of health->cloak->treads. After that I will diverge into either vang/cloak or vit/hood, depending on the enemy team comp.   Midgame, you will spend a lot of time either pushing or team fighting. It really depends on your team comp, but generally you will be pushing. Use your heal optimally to damage the enemy creeps while letting yours tank towers for longer. Pretty basic stuff.   Late game, you will want to finish a pipe for the team support component, and generally grab a heavy stat or armor item. I prefer Hexstick in most games, because more disables are never bad, but Shiva's and HoT are also very viable options. Blademail can be useful, if you find yourself being bursted down during team fights, although I rarely have that issue.   Necro's ult is often used very incorrectly, especially after it was changed to do damage after the stun. You should NOT be saving it until they are at a lethal point (i.e., the enemy would die from the damage of the ult). You should be using it to disable the enemy and allow for your team to combo their abilities in order to score a quick kill. The short duration is what makes this difficult. If you use it too early, you will find that the enemy will not take enough damage from your allies and escape. If you use it too late, you will waste your 70 sec cd on a target who was likely to die regardless of your ult. This ability generally needs good communication between you and your team to align your heavy nukes with the ult in order to maximize effectiveness.   In regards to Mek. Some people believe that Mekansm is core on Necro. Honestly, I think they are foolish. Mek is an expensive item, there is no denying that. Farming 2.5k (iirc) to spend on mek puts Necro in a very bad position for late game, as there is no way you will be tanky enough to be effective during team fights. It also puts a very heavy burden on Necro to be part of any team fights or ganks that may occur, since there is no point to having mek on your team if it is never there. This limits his farming, and he really provides nothing in terms of ganking power other than his ult. If there is nobody else on your team that can carry a mek though, go right ahead.
Of course it's possible but it's very noticeable. If you're asking in reference to the myth that lots of weed gets laced that is not necessarily true. Laced marijuana is usually more expensive because it has other things in it and they want to make money off that.
The fact that you, personally, don't give a shit doesn't matter. Many people do give a shit. People don't like having pictures taken of them without clothing, and they only possible way for it to be legal and acceptable is to  guarantee  that NOBODY BUT THE SCREENING AGENT will ever see those pictures. If the TSA cannot provide that guarantee, the machines have to go or their written policies have to change to reflect the fact that they lied about the capabilities of the machines.   I don't have an issue with the machines. I have an issue with the patdowns, because they are highly invasive but mostly because they are completely fucking useless. If a terrorist wants to bomb an american plane, given the existing security, it's pretty damn easy. Here's how you do it:     Wear something metal through the magnetometer. They will, by TSA policy, send you through extra screening which means the machine or the patdown.     Decline the scan.     Accept the patdown. You've already shoved your capsule of weaponized whatever directly up your rectum, because you know that the TSA isn't doing cavity searches and therefore they won't detect a damn thing.       The patdowns are illegal and unconstitutional; but mostly they're ineffective. Subjecting American travelers to such an invasive procedure, when you can easily demonstrate that it serves no practical purpose, is a big problem.
Had this happen at a bar last Thursday. I was eating a salad and reading emails on my phone. This guy walks in fucking plastered, tries to go into the ladies restroom (It was locked and he was still pushing on the door), gets yelled at by the bartender to use the mens one right next door. After that debacle he sidles up to the bar next to me, and orders a screwdriver, chugs half, and leans into ask me something. He says "You want to hear a funny joke", and me not wanting to get roped into another drunk conversation that I'll regret later I reply with "No". He finishes the other half of his drink, takes the change off the bar, and walks out. I mention to the bartender that there is a huge puddle of liquid right where the guy was standing. It was concluded  to either be piss or water but nobody wanted to find out for sure.
So this happened a few weeks ago but it was still a major fuck up.   So i was looking for reviews for the adult swim app and there's a review that says "you lost the game". I was confused at first thinking, I didn't know there was a game in the app. I thought it was just a streaming app. Then i read the next sentence   > You know, the one that you lose by thinking of it.   After reading that i just blankly look up from my phone in shock. I hadn't lost the game in 3+ years.   So fast-forward to the next day. Because I'm a dick, I start telling my friends " hey, you lost the game" the normal response was usually "fuck you" or something along those lines. However one person didn't know what the game was so I explained it to him.   That was my second mistake.   Because I was the first person to tell him about it, whenever he saw me he would associate me with and and tell me I lost the game. This went on for a few days usually twice a day but now I have the same effect. Whenever I see him I think of him seeing me thinking about the game. So every time I see him (twice a day) I remember "the game" and lose.
I'm going to do whatever I want to do. I want to do what is best for humanity. What is best for humanity is the question I ask myself. I ask myself why I can't find a like-minded partner. A like-minded partner is difficult to find. It's difficult to find anything anywhere. Finding anything anywhere is physics'ally impossible. It's physically impossible to find love. Found love must be metaphysical. Metaphysical is stupid. Stupid beliefs are stupid. Stupid is belief. Belief is precious. Precious is the idea that something is valuable. Good ideas are valuable. Valuable ideas are ideas that help others.
It's prison. The food tasting good is a luxury, and an unnecessary expense since it hardly ever affects the nutritional value of the food.
I guess so, thanks! I have to read up on my technical terms. Lol, I really don't know what I'm talking about, that's why I said somebody could probably answer better. Just trying to answer the question about why the initial orbit goes so far out, and in my mind the
About six months ago, my GF of nearly eight years went on a business trip right before we moved. After we moved in, I noticed her behavior was off. I asked her what's going on and she said that she's unsure of why she's still with me because she is straight (which is true). We talked and things seemed ok and we went to bed. The following weekend, I get my wisdom teeth removed and she's helping to take care of me. I'm falling asleep while we're watching a movie and she gets a text message. My eyes were blurry but I could tell it was an unfamiliar name. She looks at it quickly and sets the phone back down. My mind starts thinking but I'm too tired and fall asleep. She goes out to walk the dog but I notice she takes her phone with her - something she never does. In the morning, while she's in the bathroom, I look at her phone and there's a man's name there and says something like "lol! I'll talk to you tomorrow" it's also clear that the previous messages have been deleted. when she comes back to the bedroom, I ask "have you met someone?" She instantly looks guilty and she explains that it's a guy she met on the trip (pharmaceutical meeting) that was interested in her and she didn't tell me because I get so jealous (which is true). I ask if anything happened between them and she insists that nothing did, but they had been texting a bit during the week. I have a hard time believing that because we were supposed to Skype the second night of the trip and we didn't. I didn't hear from her until around 2am and she stopped responding to my messages around 5pm. She was out drinking with a coworker and others from the meeting. She explains the guy she met lives across the country, they have nothing in common, he was just a catalyst into her having these doubts in our relationship. I look at the phone bill and see that every time she was out walking the dog, she was trying to call this guy, only reaching him once, where they talk for 15 minutes. (When I brought this up at a later date, she says it's because she was returning his phone calls)   That night, she goes out with my friend to talk and she comes back and says she feels better and doesn't want to leave me. I find out from my friend that she told him she misses having sex with a man but we're so great together. My friend is convinced that she has no feelings for the guy she met, since she said something like "what's going to happen if I meet a guy I actually like?" It mostly puts my mind at ease.   Fast forward to now. The fact that has remained in contact with the guy has made me uncomfortable. I feel like I'm crazy, but wouldn't you feel uncomfortable if your SO was I'm contact with someone who made them question your relationship? My GF has another one of this meetings coming up at the end of September, I was wondering if this guy would be there. A couple days ago, I get curious while she's in the shower and look at her phone. Yes, he will. She sent him a message that said "maybe I can distract you during the presentations ;)" when she gets out of the shower, I ask her if he's going to be there and she says "no". I ask her if she's just saying that because she knows he makes me uncomfortable and she says "no, he won't be there". She gets mad because she feels like I don't trust her. I do, but it when she's lying to me. I played along with her because now I don't know how to tell her I read her texts without her knowledge. I checked her phone again the next day and the messages between them have been deleted (thus, the evidence). She has not been acting weird at all and reiterated that she barely knows him and doesn't speak to him that frequently at all (which is true). She also says that she likes being with me and he means nothing and I need to stop "freaking out" - her words.   I'm inclined to believe that she just doesn't want me to think about the two of them meeting again but the fact that she has lied to my face has me reeling. I need to tell her that I know, but I'm afraid of the fallout when she realizes that I was reading her messages.   PS: forgot to mention that before the first trip, we hadn't had sex in a month and were very stressed by moving. Lately, everything (sex, etc) has been great.
I'm M/17, and she is F/16. We have been friends for about 9 months, and here's the basically what's going on.   We met this summer camp that we both worked at, and I asked her out. We talked for about a week after that, but eventually, she told me that we should just be friends. So we were. Over this summer, we became really close friends. We told each other our secrets. I still liked her, and she admitted to liking me. (She couldn't go out with me because she was having trouble getting over another guy.) A couple weeks ago was the peak of our friendship. She told me that she loved me. Said I was handsome...   Then it went downhill. It was getting boring after two weeks of texting every day, and we both knew it. Eventually, the topic of 11:11 came up. She asked if I wished for the same thing every time, and I said, "Yeah, but I never comes true :/" then she was like, "Well what do you wish for". I messed up big here. I said, "You". She told me that she felt terrible, and I felt terrible as well, and it sent me into a spiral of depression that lasted for about a week, during which, we didn't talk at all.   Now, I texted her on sunday, and we have been talking about relationships, and she told me that she is content with just being single, and then eventually I changed the subject to us hanging out, because we've been trying to plan something for a while, but we are both so busy. Now she seems distant. I asked her, "So when are we hangin' out :P" and she replied, "I don't know". Then I was like, "Well, I'm free pretty much every saturday", and she said, "Okay", and that's where we're at.   I want to ask her if everything is alright, but I don't know If it's such a good idea. I'm afraid I'm losing her as a friend. She is the person I can tell anything. I don't know what I would do without her. I've accepted the fact that I probably won't end up with her, but she doesn't know that I have yet. Any Advice?
first off, I just discovered this sub and it is the cats pajamas!  Any info you can provide me regarding the following situation is greatly appreaciated.   Scenario:  Playing in a 1/3 nl game at a b&m.  Action is preflop, player A raises to $20.  Action to player B, who comes forward across with $80 ($5 chips) in his hand and cuts 3 stacks leaving one finger on the final chip and then announces "make it 10 more chips on top of this."  Dealer calls a string bet, floorman upholds the ruling, and all hell breaks loose with player B saying that since he did not complete his betting action/motion by removing his finger from the final chip, he should be allowed the opportunity to raise more.  Floorman says that the amount of the final raise should have been declared before moving any chips forward, and he was only allowed to raise what was in his hand.  Do you guys think this was the correct ruling?  I have the opposite ruling in the same situation at other rooms and was just curious what you all think about this situation.  Thanks in advance!!
The girl I have been dating has been through some hard times. Her mom died of cancer almost 3 years ago, and she has been in a downward spiral ever since. Weather it's drinking or smoking pot she has to do it a few times a week. I met her 2 weeks ago we went on a date, which was her first one ever! Although she hasn't been on any dates she is not a beginner in the sex department. I like her but she keeps warning me she's not a good girl and saying "you don't know what your getting yourself into". She texts me first almost every day so it's an indication she is thinking about me and wants to talk, but she texts other guys flirting. She hasn't hung out with other guys since we have been talking but how do I help her become better and make things exclusive
My little brother did this once.   He asked me to take him to a game store to buy some game after school (he was 13ish, I was 18/19 and he needed an adult to buy the game) I asked if he had enough money cause I wasn't buying it, he said yes, so I took him.   We get to the counter and the total is like $20-$25ish or something, he reaches in to his backpack and pulls out $5 in cash and then a huge gallon sized bag filled with change. The cashier and I both have this look of 'dude...you serious bro?' and of course there is a line.   So after a split second I blurt/yell out "Are you fucking kidding me? Uh no. We'll go to a bank and exchange  the coins for cash. " Brother starts to get mad because he doesn't want to leave and come back. I told him "If you really want your game you will." and walked out. The store gladly held the game, and the cashier couldn't stop thanking me. Little brother was embarrassed but got his game.
I'm fairly new to the game (60hrs) but I'm pretty decent at it. I've played many other fps's. At one point I was one of the top few hundred players of bf3 in terms of kpm and spm to give you an idea. I'm basically a fragger in training. It stinks to play with teammates (especially as t) who wait and don't make any sort of move. Don't even mention screamers, abandoners, etc. You can only do so much as one player. I have been on the other side, but I'm tired of games not even being close. I'm pretty handy with the ak and m4. I can be pretty good with the awp, but it depends if my flick shots are on that day. My weakest point is my strategy; I'm still learning. Anyways thanks.
I remember one night when I was about 18 or 19 (I'm 29 now).  I laid down on my bed at like 8:00pm with my laptop and booted up Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.   When I finally looked up again from my computer screen - the sun was coming up.   I have no idea what happened to the time, between 8pm and 6am (give or take) - I was so totally engrossed in my game, I had no idea that I had just gone the entire night trying to take over a planet and forge diplomatic alliances and destroy other factions.  But - - that was the magic of that game.  It was so playable and accessible and you always had to take just one more turn.  Always.     Even after all these years, that particular occasion still rings so true in my head as to the power of the Sid Meier games.  Even Civilization had an effect on me similar, but never quite as pronounced as losing an entire night without realizing it.   Something about Alpha Centauri just sucked me in.  I still haven't purchased the new "Beyond Earth" game.  But I am definitely looking forward to the new "Starships" game.  Can't wait to see how that will play out.   But yeah.  Just wanted to share my experience with these games (Civ, Alpha Centauri, whatev)
My fiance and I have been together for seven years.  We also have an absolutely wonderful 21 month old son.  Since he was born, mother struggled with postpartum. She dealt with depression before the pregnancy, but felt it especially hard after he was born.  She sought help and was prescribed anti-depressants.  Pretty sure she failed to mention to the doc that she is a marijuana addict.  Around this same time she started drinking.  I cannot say how heavily because she hid it from me.  If I questioned the smell of her breath, she would swear up and down that it was mouthwash or that I must be crazy.  Empty bottle caches were found and when confronted she would admit that she was drinking too much, but it wasn't too serious and she would stop.  Or so I thought.  Apparently it continued.  Every few months or so I would find another stash of empty bottles and I would get the same spiel.  I blame myself for not putting an end to it sooner, but she was being sneaky as a mouse so I always thought she was taking substantial breaks before I would find another stash of bottles.  Throughout all of this we were successfully raising a happy and beautiful boy.  She is a good mother.  She fulfills all of his needs for the 9 hours each weekday that I am at work.  Whether she is drunk during this time is somewhat unknown, but I have evidence that would suggest she is some of the time (and definitely smoking mj throughout the day).  Anyways, just found that she cheated on me last weekend (slept with dude).  I have lost all ability to trust her after learning this and dealing with the lies about her drinking. So, it has to be over.  A part of me really wants to work things out with her and try to move past, but I cannot let myself do that.  What do I do? Lawyer, I would assume... We're not married, so would that just be a family law attorney? My main concern at this point is our son.  It kills me to know that he will have to experience the split parent circus.
I believe in April I will make a speech in front of the Maryland State House about Police brutality and how Maryland should stop wasting money on police officers that dont need it. So I need help with some ideas. Lately in Montgomery County an officer killed a ten year old boy while he was drunk and only lost his job.
It looks like you're getting a little flak for not liking the "I love my mommy" onesies and etc., and I just wanted to jump in with some solidarity, brother. I hate that shit: when you have a baby, you don't  need  a shirt to tell you that your baby loves you. For me, those shirts remind me that some people don't really love their baby (for whatever reason), and they need a shirt to remind them to love, not shake, their baby.
I don't know about you guys, but I have not told anyone I know that I'm watching this show and greatly enjoying it. I normally talk to people about whatever I'm into at the time, but it's pretty easy to form the wrong impressions from just one frame of the show.   Hell, even I was like that before I watched it. I'm sure I'm not alone in this, but when I first saw screenshots of Kill La Kill, my first thought was "wow, schoolgirls fighting in skimpy mecha uniforms. I think I'll give this a miss". Obviously, I understand it a little better now, but I'm not sure how I would explain it. You could bring up the plot reasons, but those are honestly kinda weak. What about all the metaphors the show is built around, like coming of age and stuff like that?   I sure as hell am not letting anyone I watch this until I'm confident I can convince them it's not a porno.
I was on a server 3 or 4 days ago trying to votescramble because I was in the exact situation I detailed in my previous post.  Trying to talk sense to people who didn't seem to have their speakers or headphones plugged in.   I was belittled by the other team for trying to make things balanced until the first round that their team lost.  The next votescramble I proposed passed in record time.   I called hypocrisy, and no one seemed to pick up on why I would have done so.
Luck, and a little help. Someone gave me a Pure Bladestone as I had already spent a good three days working on it continuously.   As for the rest of the stones, most of them are based on luck. Sometimes an enemy might drop a Pure, and other times it might not. As for the Pure Moonlightstone, I'm pretty sure the only way to get one is from the Crystal Lizards in 3-2 and 3-3.  There are very few there and have limited spawns like any of the others. My advice is beat the entire world then go farming for the stones. Beating the world increases how many lizard spawns you get.  Also, PBWT helps with drop rates, so there's that.
I have a degree and a very good job in the engineering field. Im a regular pot smoker, and on the rare event I'll ear mushrooms. I got busted in a parking garage on my way to a a concert with chocolates. It's a felony. I'm at risk of losing my career and my freedom because I wanted Trip something I do maybe twice a year. Also I'm not looking for sympathy,  I realize I made a choice and now I'm accepting the consequences.
Sept. 1502, Kingdom of Kampuchea   "Speak, Ang Chanda, speak,"   Srei Sukonthor said, somewhat anxiously.   "What is your report on Prey Nokor?"   Ang Chanda, who had recently spent two years [expanding the city of Prey Nokor]( smiled and bowed to the king.   "My lord, we have seen a marked increase in the trade strength of Prey Nokor.  The city has been expanded, according to my plans, and now has sufficient housing to support its growing population.  Speaking of which..."   Ang Chanda trailed off as he vaguely pondered something.   "Yes, Minister Chanda?"  the king asked, curiosity piqued.   Ang Chanda's concentration faltered and he bowed again to the king.   "I was only thinking...  We've had quite a large number of refugees from Dai Viet since the end of the war in the east..."  Ang Chanda trailed off again for a moment, trying to recall some essential detail, before grunting abruptly.   "Hmph!  Lost it.  There doesn't seem to be anything suspicious there."   Srei Sukonthor nodded patiently as Ang Chanda returned to the topic at hand and finished his report on Prey Nokor.  When he was finished reading off his documentation, Srei Sukonthor smiled and addressed him again.   "Ang Chanda, you have done a great service to the kingdom.  You have impressed Us greatly with your work at Prey Nokor, and thus We are establishing a new office for you.  You shall now be Our Director of Public Works.  Come, Director Chanda, and receive your new orders."   Ang Chanda bowed deeply as he accepted his new tally of office.   "Our kingdom has spent the last several years rebuilding, restructuring, and growing.  We have been fortunate to see such successes in Our life.  However, We do not believe in growth merely for the sake of growth,"   Srei Sukonthor continued, feeling like a great and wise king.   "Our goal is not to grab impulsively at short-term opportunities, but instead to strengthen the backbone of the Kampuchean economy.  To this end, We would like to direct some of Our newfound revenue to the maintenance and expansion of Kampuchean infrastructure; to build and rebuild roads, to provide rest stops for weary travelers, to construct new marketplaces and protect the old."   The king motioned to one of his palace servants, who produced a decree for Ang Chanda.   "We shall give your department 30,000 slaves and 2mil ducats to accomplish these tasks.  The Kingdom of Kampuchea will rely on your genius, Director Chanda."   Ang Chanda bowed again and accepted his new office.  He was filled with a great confidence as he set out for his new post as Director of Public Works.  Ang Chanda knew that a success in this project would propell his standing in the Royal Court, and now his heart simmered with ambition.
I have been looking around and I am finding some really ridiculous high prices for crushed stone for inlay. Like 10 to 15 dollars for half an ounce. I am making a gift for my mother for a wedding and need quite a bit of Green Serpentine to inlay into a cut out cedar tree. Does anyone know of a reasonable supplier? Any help would be appreciated.
So a "friend" of mine got me a used launchpad mini for christmas, and whenever I plug it in I get a standard "device not recognized" error.   When I first got it, I could get it to work by uninstalling the drivers, and then it would be detected by my DAW for a short period of time before it would stop responding all together, and then it would go back to the same "device descriptor request failed."   I've tried replacing the microUSB cable, I've tried reinstalling the drivers in device manager, I've updated all my generic USB hub drivers, and I'm starting to run out of ideas.   I'm worried it's a problem with the USB port on the launchpad mini, as I'm really not on good terms with the person who gave it to me so I'm not sure how possible a return would be if it's a problem with the controller itself.
Is anyone else going to offer their predictions? Or is everyone to scared people won't agree them?  This topic could be a lot of fun, seeing where everyone differs and what not, but everyone just seems to want to hate on mine predictions, which you're all entitled to do, but no one is offering anything else.  Anyways, addressing the few new points:   The Nuggets: A week ago I had this team last, but since then they brought back Nene and Afflo and brought in Fernandez and Brewer.  Those four moves moved this team up greatly.  I can certainly see them making the playoffs.  The main issue I have is aside from Nene, there posts don't score (unless you count Harrington as a 4) and while Nene is a good offensive player, he's not a big time scorer.  They also don't have a go to guy on offense.  The have people that can have big games, but no one who can go out and score 20 every night.  Unless you want Harrington out there for 30+ minutes, which I can't imagine you do.  And I think they're making a mistake starting Lawson over Miller.  Maybe I need to much more Nuggets game, but from what I have seen, Lawson is a solid PG but I never see him being close to an all-star.  Miller is one of the more underrated players too.  So, yes I can see the Nuggets finishing a bit hire than 9th.  But as you can see NattyRedd, I think those are solid reasons to believe they'll finish that low.  Now are you going to offer reasons why that's wrong or are you just going to call it stupid and not offer anything reason to why it is.   The Magic: I do believe I might have them a little higher than they should be.  But Boston will certainly decline from last year and the Magic should be about the same.  A lot of this depends on Howard.  As my MVP voting shows, I expect a huge season from.  If they end up trading him for Brook Lopez, then they go way down.  Again with most teams, I can see them finishing in a different place, that's just where I have them now.   Noah: This is a prediction, not who I believe is the best (if they were who I believed were the best,Iguodala would be ahead of LeBron on defense).  Noah is certainly a good defensive player and he gets a lot of love from around the league.  The Bulls will finish first or second in the East (possibly the league) so it will be easy to vote him.  Of course you could say Howard for the fourth year in a row, but that's gotta end sometime.   Lakers: Yes they lost a lot, and I can see the Clips and Dallas finishing ahead of them, but they still have Kobe, Bynum, and Gasol.  Barnes is a decent role player and World Peace will play better under Brown's system.  Their PG's suck but Bryant carries the ball up most of the time anyways.  They certainly aren't as strong as last year, but if Bynum can finally have a healthy season this team can still be one of the top teams in the West.  Kobe just has that much more to prove this year.   Kings: I'm surprised no one mentioned this one yet.  I really like this Kings team.  I expect Evans to play a lot closer to his rookie year.  He should be healthy and he played a lot better second half.  Trading Casspi for Hickson was a great move.  Thornton and Fredette are scoring machines.  Salmons and Outlaw are a great combo at the three.  Both do a bit of everything and have been around for a while.  And Cousins has a lot of game.  If he can mature he can be a top 7 center in the league.  A lot of talent, just has to figure out how to use it and how to conduct himself.   So I've explained myself, now will the many who disagree (I know some have) be willing to explain why they think differently?  Or will you, you know, actually offer predictions.  These no reason why this shouldn't be a popular thread.  We all have predictions, so why not share them and offer insightful criticisms?
Living near Sydney I get to a few Swans (now Giants as well) games a year. I used to get to more when I was with my ex, because we both enjoyed it, but now its just me, I dont really have that many friends who like AFL, going to games by myself can get a little bit boring, especially if its a night game and Ive got a late night 1.5hour drive home by myself.   Also I work every Friday, every Sunday, and every second Saturday, so it limits the days that I can go to games to once a fortnight, unless I organise to take annual leave for that day (which involves planning in advance, Im terrible at that). I like seeing the Tigers play, I like the Sydney Derbys, and I like games that I know will draw a big crowd, so I just see what I can get to each year.  This was taken when I was on holidays in Melbourne, I went to 4 games while I was down there. Unfortunately, I think Im only going to be able to get to 5 games in Sydney this year.
Great advice.  Your job is not your life, though if you're in an industry you enjoy, you'll be much happier.  Getting to design car parts is extremely competitive, especially if you want to stay in the US.   As a sidenote, I used to work for a railcar financing company in a big downtown high-rise office.  Suit and ties and excel spreadsheets during the week, but on the weekends, they'd turn into 8 yo boys and run around the countryside chasing antique trains.
My girlfriend slept over last night and had to leave early this morning for work. She has a history of snooping through my messages stored on my iPad, which I keep in another room. So when I woke up this morning, I knew to check if my messages were recently opened. They were. I knew it was from her because it automatically opened to a conversation with one of my friends that she always thinks I’m having inappropriate conversations about her with (which I’m not). And I haven’t talked to that friend in a while so she had to scroll all the way to the bottom of my messages to find it.   As I mentioned, she’s done this in the past and actually told me she did it because she found text messages from my ex, which weren’t inappropriate or disrespectful to her. I haven’t talked to my ex since then. I told her I understood why she was upset, but that I didn’t approve of her snooping through my stuff because it’s a violation of my privacy and that I have nothing to hide from her. Whenever I’m with her and receive a text message, she’s always glancing over to see who it is. She doesn’t normally act like a jealous person when it comes to me going out with friends, but it’s just snooping through my stuff that puts me on edge.   My ex texted me last week right after her boyfriend broke up with her. I didn't respond and I voluntarily showed my girlfriend the message, hoping this would show her that I'm not trying to hide anything or have an interest in my ex. I think this is what caused the snooping last night, to see if I was lying about not responding.   I'm 7/10 upset and I don't know what to do about it. Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks for asking, Prepare for a wall of text. Hopefully I can share some insight into this. I went down to 160lb at my lowest, this is an issue because I'm 6ft 3in (around 192cm?). Apparently I looked ill at that weight. Generally I held my weight around 180-200lb.   I subsequently got in a relationship and you know how that goes for most people, you get comfortable and you gain a bit of weight, so I'm around 215lb at the moment which isn't too bad considering my height but I'm going to be putting myself back to the 180lb mark this year through diet and extensive cycling.   I do not recommend anyone try starving themselves to get into shape.     You lose muscle mass faster than fat, this is bad.     You will become irritable.     You will be tired all the time.     Your health will decline.       You will not get any satisfaction or sense of accomplishment if you hit your goal, especially when you have to explain to people how you did it, you will be embarrassed and feel like you've cheated yourself.   Healthy diet and exercise all the way. Don't think I mean only eat veg and salad. Eat whatever you want, just moderate the bad stuff. Learn portion sizes and pace yourself, eating isn't a race, take the time to enjoy your food, you will feel full afterwards. Exercise daily for 30minutes, this can be anything that gets your heart racing, walking, running, cycling, swimming. Something as silly as walking up and down stairs for 30minutes will still count. I personally like jump rope and cycling, find something you enjoy.   I hope that answers your question and provides a little insight into making some positive life changes for anyone reading this that was in the same position as me.
Hi There! I recently adopted two shepherd mixes and I'm trying to determine the best option for walking them together. Both of them pull on the leash, but they've also made pretty good progress and I am continuing to work with them on that.  I've used a head collar with both of them, and I find it pretty effective. They definitely pull less! I've also used a no pull harness, and while that helps, it isn't as fool proof as the head collar.   Now that they are both walking more or less on a loose leash, I'm wondering if it is safe to put them on a double leash together? They are different sizes (one is about 35 lbs, the other is 70 lbs). Assuming both are using their manners they should be able to keep up with each other. Also related, I would like to use the head collars on both of them until they are really solid with heeling on a loose leash,  is it safe to use head collars on a double leash?   I'm willing to continue with two leashes if need be, but since I am the only one available to walk the dogs in the mornings I'm hoping to graduate to the "simplest" solution as soon as possible.  Thoughts? Suggestions? Opinions?
I'm pretty new to Reddit and not used to posting anything, but i figured that my fuckup would entertain a few so here it goes.   It was the middle of July in 2014 and I was curious to see if magnifying glasses could actually concentrate enough sunlight to burn something (mind you i love fire).  There wasn't a single cloud in the sky and I had nothing better to do than to be destructive so I decided to try to burn army soldiers with a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass that I had was dollar store quality, but I found that i could definitely melt army soldiers once I was able to find the right angle and distance of the magnifying glass.   I progressed from army soldiers, to grass, to a mass genocide of ants, and basically anything I could find. I eventually was able to catch a pizza box on fire in my driveway and was pretty surprised by the power of such a crappy magnifying glass. But I wasn't satisfied.   I have a bonfire pit in my backyard that is safely surrounded by bricks so I decided I would try to light a whole bonfire with just a magnifying glass. No matter how hard I tried the crappy magnifying glass wasn't strong enough to light sticks or wood on fire, and lighting paper and putting it under the sticks was a pointless endeavor.   I then remembered my father's high quality, wooden magnifying glass on his desk. I stole his magnifying glass and it lit wood sticks on fire almost instantly. It was really hard to get the perfect angle of the magnifying glass on sticks deep in the bonfire so I brought the bundle of sticks out into my open field full of dry, dead grass and soybean stalks. This is where I fucked up.   I wanted to light the sticks on fire in the open and bring them to the bonfire once they were lit; however, the magnifying glass was so strong that it burned a hole straight through my pile of sticks and caught the dry field on fire.   The wind catalyzed the flame and started spreading like a wildfire. Stomping on the ring of fire would result in it immediately reigniting itself. The ring started becoming so big that I couldn't possibly keep up stomping on it and i decided to build a ring of dirt around it. There wasn't enough dirt for me to grab and by the time I would have gotten enough, the fire would have spread way too much. I couldn't grab the hose as it was way too far away. The only thing I could find way my dad's grill tarp. I smothered the hell out of the fire with the tarp and managed to put out the fire.   Here is picture proof of the 30ft fire:   The overall result of this event; I was out $50 for a grill tarp, my neighbors almost called the police, burnt my backyard and a lesson about fires: do them indoors!
Long  time lurker, first time poster.  Time to start giving back to this community!   First, some background info about myself.  I'm a classic engineer type AFC.  I've primarily been involved in LTR before and never really "gamed" before.  Usually when I go out, I'm with my other AFC friends and we end up sitting in the corner alone drinking and fantasizing about what it would be like to interact with females.  I'm a decent looking guy and I hit the gym pretty hard, so occasionally a girl will open me but I usually don't have much to say to keep a conversation going.   No more.  I wanted to break out of my shell and finally try out everything I've been reading about here.  Felt like my friends were holding me back so running solo was the best way to achieve this.   So let's get started.  I hit up the first bar of the night, which is this local Irish dive.  I know the bartenders pretty well here so I walk in, start shaking hands and try to get myself into state for the rest of the night.  However, after the initial banter my AFC kicks in and I'm leaning on the bar alone, sipping my beer and pretending to read text messages.  No, not again!  Fortunately, after about 10 minutes, the HB6 sitting next to me opens me, asking why I was drinking water at the same time I was drinking my beer (I just happened to be thirsty).  I respond with "I'm thirsty, and they only let you order one beer at a time".  This mildly witty comment gets a laugh, and we start talking.  She tells me she works in publishing, I say that's boring.  She playfully responds "I'm not boring!  What do you do that makes you so exciting?"  I respond with "I'm training to become an astronaut" (saw this tactic recently here, kudos to whoever posted I can't remember).  She laughs, and then this transitions into a talk about how we both sometimes make up ridiculous answers to the "what do you do" question and how you can make people at a bar believe anything.  I then follow up with "And I should tell you, nyc_aspiring_pua is not even my real name!" (we had already exchanged names at this point).  This gets a HUGE laugh and she's hooked.  However, as I said before I wasn't really interested and decided to eject at this point while I was still riding high.  I pay my tab, give her a hug saying "It was fun meeting you!" and bounce.  Now I'm feeling confident!   The next bar is big local hangout and it's bumping.  HBs everywhere, sets all over the place.  I immediately head to the bar, order a drink, and notice a group of 4 HB 7-8.s  They're acting pretty silly and look relatively young, so I open with "Are you guys sure you're old enough to be here?".  They're a little taken aback, respond with "Of course!  That's flattering though", and then I tell them I don't believe them and that I need to see their IDs.  There's one HB 7 in the group that's giving me IOI's so I used this to initiate some light kino (while asking for the IDs).  Set is going well, I can tell the girls are digging me, until the alpha of  the group pulls a shit test on me "So which one of my friends do you want to fuck?".  I wasn't prepared for this and didn't have much of an answer.  Instantly I fell out of state.  I responded with "Uhhhh, no one...", and then for reasons that still remain unclear, I recalled a recent FR where the OP said "I'm gay".  I gave it a shot, said "I'm actually gay", and BOY did that kill the set.  I wasn't in alpha mode when I said the line, and it transformed the fun situation into an incredibly awkward one.  The alpha girl responds with something like "Oh...well enjoy that", to which I desperately respond "HAHA I'm kidding!"  Epic failure!  I eject and return to the bar to regroup.   This group leaves, and I spot a HB8 with a HB9 sitting at a booth.  They look like they'e having a really intimate conversation (leaning over the table, staring intensely at one another) so I open with "So are you two on a date?"  They laugh, and I'm in.  I sit down next to the HB8 and immediately we all hit it off.  These girls are really cool, I start negging the HB8 about where she's from (a really ritzy town), making fun of her expensive clothes/purse.  I'm initiating light kino (brushing arms, elbowing etc.) and we're all having a good time.  After about 30 minutes, random dude that HB9 had met/hooked up with before spots her and sits down with us.  Uh oh.  At first, this isn't a problem, I'm targeting the HB8 and we're all still having a good time.  HB9 and the dude start having their own conversation, so HB8 and I start "gossiping" about them across the table ("How do you think it's going?!  etc.  This is actually working out in my favor, since I'm initiating more kino and getting some isolation with HB8.  But then this dudes 3 other friends show up.  They're all AFCs, but seem a bit douchey and I'm not feeling the situation as much anymore.  They're all staring longingly at the work the main dude is doing on the HB9 and there's no sign they're going anywhere.  I have to take a piss, but I know as soon as I leave there's probably no way I'm re-entering the set.  I grab HB8's number before leaving as an insurance policy.  Upon returning, just as I expected, the group of douchey AFC's take over.  I try to joke with them, "Hey man, what kind of gentleman are you taking my seat like that!", but they don't respond (they probably need to get on seddit).  HB8 is still hanging around, but she's definitely not leaving her friend so I say goodbye and eject.  Looking back, this could have been a GREAT opportunity to do some texting ("Hey, what's up with that group of guys?!"), but unfortunately I didn't think to at the time.   Whatever!  I'm still riding high and start scoping out the rest of the bar.  Next I open a 2 set with a HB 7 and her AWFUL cockblock HB5 (maybe) of a friend.  I can tell the HB 7 is into me, but the HB5 is in-between so I can't get any kino going and escalate the interaction.  HB5 is KILLING me.  I cannot explain how bad this girl was, every comment was negative, and she was shit-testing me left and right.  She says: "Oh, all you NYC guys suck.  How many long term girlfriends have you had?".  I try to be smooth here and say "I'm a generous guy and I like to share my love with the world".  HB7 laughs, HB5 says (in a negative way) "Typical NYC asshole!!  I hate guys like you!"  (I wish I was ACTUALLY the type of guy she hated, but I'm still working on that ;).  Anyways, after this I've had enough of this girl and eject.  Should have # closed her friend but I was afraid I would be assaulted if I even tried.   I open a couple more sets with mixed results (one instant rejection, I opened with "You guys look bored", which they did, and all the girl gives me is "No we're not".  I disagreed, but I had nothing to say and moved on.  # closed a girl I had met the previous week,  and ended up # closing a girl at the bar who claimed to be engaged.  She was a HB8, but from eastern Europe which for me puts her to HB9+, something about that accent!.  This was towards the end of the night after the place had cleared out a bit, she was with a friend and I just happened to be sitting next to her.  I opened with a standard "Hi, I'm nyc_aspiring_pua" and we talked for about 20 minutes.  She seemed really cool and we had a good conversation, but when I asked for the number she gave it, but qualified with "But I'm engaged".  I said "well this number can't be real then!  Let's test it!".  I grab her phone, put it on the bar, and then texted something dumb like "You're a phony!".  The number was real, but she still maintained that she is in fact engaged but just likes to go out alone and have fun.  I'm still not sure whether she was making this up or not...she seemed to be telling the truth but you never know.  Anyways, it's closing time, so I pat her on the arm and say "Hey, nice to meet you!  Maybe I'll text your fake phone number one of these days".  She responds with "Ok, nice meeting you too", or something of that nature.  Don't really know where to go from here...seddit any thoughts on this?   All in all, even though I didn't get an f-close, it was a successful night.  I opened a lot of sets (which I never do) and had a great time meeting so many different people.  Got 3 #'s which I'll follow up with, but regardless of whether they pan out I'll be ready for next week.
From experience of separating them myself many a time, here's a how to:     Pull full wing so it makes a v with the useless flipper.   Push in with a sharp knife (I use one with a serrated backend for help) you should feel a notch you can push the blade a bit into and as you cut feel little resistance. Should cut easily.  If you have trouble just think about what the wings you eat look like which will help with finding the cartilage/joint   Next make a v again with wing and hold the drum stick. See that bulbous part of drumstick? Joint to cut is going to be as you hold the knife angled towards wing. Again, shouldn't feel like you have to push too hard to cut.     Sorry if this was unclear, I can go through a dozen full wings in a few minutes so I tried to describe my method.
I would like to play Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty for the ending of my eighth grade Rite of Passage Experience (ROPE) presentation. Problem is, I don't really feel like paying $5 for a song I'll likely play once... Anyone got a copy they could send to me or know of where I could get one? Thanks!
So this might be an odd post but I think it belongs here.   About 8 months ago my first long term relationship was ended by my ex. We were together for 3 years and I was very hurt by it. About 3 months ago I reinitiated contact with an old fling/friend. He had just gotten out of a relationship too so we were helping each other. We decided to become FWB.   Things seemed to be going well, till he started getting distant. This of course confused me cause we weren't together nor dating so why would he be acting like that. I wanted sex and isn't that what ever guy wants just meaningless sex?   Anyway the other day I asked if he was free and wanted to meet up to which he said I was smothering him and needed to give him space. This threw me back of course cause how can you smother someone you're not seeing?!   I got mad of course and we exchanged some anger text. So the next day I sent him a text basically apologizing and saying that maybe it wasn't best for us to be FWB cause he seemed like he didn't want it but that I still wanted to be friends.   He never responded and I'm starting to feel upset now. He was someone I trusted and turned too after feeling upset about my ex. I did like him he made me feel good again after not feeling good for months. I know I should say fuck him and forget about the whole thing. But for some reason it just hurts.   Can anyone give me some advise?
Long story short, making $97,000 with company A in state A, company B offers me $110,000 in state B. I take the job with company B and move to state B, company A asks me to remain a full time employee consulting for them at the same salary, which I accept. Full benefits from both companies still. So now my annual income is $207,000.   What I am worried about is how everything will pan out come tax time. My boss at company A was very high up and basically just told me I'll be working remote and we aren't breaking the news to HR yet so I haven't officially changed my residence at company A.   So I am getting taxes taken out from both pay checks in each state but neither state knows about the income in other state, until tax time, which makes me worried.
I don't think being smart really has anything to do with getting in to RTF...  After all it is film and not engineering.  They want kids who have shown interest in the area.  You should have a list of RTF related projects and things you did in highschool, my friend was the chief editor of his schools TV station.
That's really cool. I've only been to Melbourne once in my life, but I managed to take a tram up to Arden St. and soak up the atmosphere of the place. I was really sad that the Gasometer wasn't there nowadays.
Hey guys! I've never posted here before, so please, please bear with me. I promise this was as short as I could possibly make it!   I am 20 years old, and three years ago my parents died in a car accident. I was to inherit a million dollars from them on my 25th birthday, but for the time being the money is in an account held by my godparents (let's call them Mark and Mary - both in their 50's) and a family lawyer. I live in New York. Mark and Mary live in England. There are two problems.   PROBLEM ONE:   Anyway, to keep things short, an agreement was made that Mark and Mary (not real names) will send me money every 6 months to use as living expenses. I bought a condo, under their advice. I did not chose it. This income they send bi-yearly pays for all of my bills. For income to cover food and necessities for myself, I rent out my spare bedroom to a tenant.   A very, very, very long and complex story made short: I asked Mark and Mary exactly what being a landlord entailed, they answered with "You're an adult, do whatever feels best!" And that resulted in my tenants NEVER paying their rent. I was never educated on the first and last month upfront rule, or how to evict a tenant if they refuse to leave. Essentially speaking, I've been a prisoner under their rule. I thought that I must have been an incompetent human, but what I didn't realize is that there are ways around these things like contracts... Which I was, simply, never told about. But I have no idea if that holds up in any kind of legal argument or not. Aren't these people supposed to take the role of my parents as caretakers?   To keep an even longer story just as short: Mark and Mary now believe that I "betrayed" them. They refuse to give me any more money. Considering they set me up for failure in every way they possibly could, I began to get suspicious that they may  want  the money themselves. I don't believe they're purposely trying to kill me or anything in order to receive it, but I do believe wholeheartedly that their intentions are to give me no guidance so that it will be inevitable that I will fail. I had to drop out of school and even with a full time job and a proper tenant now, I can not afford this condo (it is owned outright in cash, I should mention) by myself. There is a maintenance fee sent by the condo each month and I don't know what the consequences will be if I don't pay it. Will I get my house removed from me? That's the impression I've gotten so far.   So I guess my question is: can I find a mediator? Somebody to judge their harsh methods as inappropriate to be my caretakers? A lawyer? When I bring up how unfair I believe my treatment is, I am always met with the words: "If you think we're unfair, you can hire a lawyer when you're 25, but good luck getting one without money." (Word for word from an email).   Do they actually have any responsibility to take care of me? Or are they not obligated to because I am over 18? How is somebody with an inheritance waiting for them to turn of age meant to live on their own? Are there any laws protecting me? It seems absolutely insane that because I was orphaned, I have no safety net protecting me from poverty, no matter how hard I work.   Can my godparents take away my house because it was used with money that wasn't mine  yet ?   Some things I'll also mention: I found a tumor, and was refused money to have it biopsied. I still don't know if I have cancer, and it's been five months but they refuse to send me money for the procedure.   I was promised, in our agreement, that I would never starve so long as I was under their "care". The $0 in my bank account and my constantly declining body mass index says otherwise.   It's not a written agreement, everything has been done through phone calls and emails (although the emails on their side are always EXTREMELY vague, with no definitive answers, and always saying "phone us" instead). It's very sketchy to me. The entire thing has never been right and it truly looks as through they were protecting their asses legally from day one.   So, guys, how do I protect myself? My godparents are very rich, and whatever lawyer they can afford will be better than mine which is something I am truly terrified of. Honestly, I don't even know how to find a lawyer with $0!   Anyway, if I'm screwed then oh well. People have been homeless before and at the very least I might only have to be for the next five years (unless, of course, Mark and Mary find a way around this).   PROBLEM TWO: Since my parent's accident, I've suffered extensively from PTSD. They have refused money for a therapist, but they have said that they will pay me to have a long term residential stay at a psychiatric ward. I have never been a harm to myself or others, and I want to know how likely it is they can force this on me. I would also like to know what they can do with my money if I am deemed unable to care for myself. Will they extend the age I receive it? What power do they have over me when it comes to this? I am actually a very calm person around other people and they mentioned this option casually rather than in a moment of distress. I don't think anybody with good intentions would want me institutionalized while they hold my money. They even mentioned that in an inpatient facility, I would have my home and my cat taken away due to my mental state. I am, truthfully, not sure why they are making a big deal out of this and it seems mischievous and perplexing, especially when the only contact I've had with them has been over the phone.
They're POP Punk.  Are you like 8 years old?
Oh mannnn. I love looking at pictures of people happy and in love but I just don't ever imagine it'll be me.

I am a 20 year old female. This may seem like a silly question, and I'm sorry in advance if this is not in the right sub!   My parents had a very messy divorce when I was fifteen. My entire life my dad was walking in and out of the house, always due to a huge fighting spree my parents would have for months before. I would wake up at night at six years old to my parents screaming at one another. Due to many comments I heard from my father ("Of all the women in the world, I had to choose her"/"She is horrible"/and a note he left when I was about ten saying "I only stayed with you for the sex") and mother (occasionally blaming me or going on my entire life about how terrible he was- which he was, but I still do not believe a child should hear that about her family, no matter what the situation). I have always felt afraid of dating/having a sexual relationship/being abandoned.   I've never been in a 'real' relationship before. I had an online girlfriend when I was in my mid teens for about eight months, but her and I never met, lived in different countries, and I do not consider that to have been a real relationship looking back- though I did care for her strongly.   I've had a fling with a boy [19/m (at the time)] and have gone on a few dates but they never go on to a second date or the boy I am texting will not reply, but I have never had a real boyfriend or girlfriend. I do not think I am unattractive. I'm hygienic, AT LEAST a 7/10, nice, caring, funny, well educated and aside from the sex phobia rather well rounded. A lot of people like me and I can talk to people and make acquaintances very easily. I also have a part time job, I'm a full-time student, and I recently spent six months with a theatre group rehearsing and putting on a show. So I do get myself out there and participate, as much as time allows.   I have a small handful of close friends, and I love them dearly. Only about three or four. I am a strange mix of outgoing but shy, depending on my situation. I am also an introvert and very busy being a student and working, so I don't see them very often. And I'm okay with that- at times.   However, I have noticed that I tend to isolate myself from my friends every now and then. I find that I can get irritable and push them away, being completely alone for weeks at a time.   Right now I am in this phase, but I don't like it. I feel very disconnected and isolated from my friends and the world around me. I am also very single and very lonely.   With my last big "fling" (in which I met a boy I really liked, we hung out, had sex (it was my first time and we did a few more times afterwards)), I got really freaked out and ruined it. I believe this was because of my history of being a divorce child and hearing many terrible comments from my parents back and forth about sex or how they wish they had never met, yada yada yada. I also was scared that he did not really like me, and was using me as a rebound as he and his longterm girlfriend had broken up a few months earlier. I felt self conscious and like we couldn't talk much, we basically just sat quietly and watched TV and movies, he would initiate sex, and I would go along with it. I was self conscious and felt I was not performing well, didn't know what to do/how to be, etc. This was about a year and a half ago, and I don't know if I am over him (or if I even really liked him and I am just dwelling because I am lonely).   I'm starting to get that dreaded "I'm going to be alone forever" single feeling, and I am feeling like I have no friends (though I do have friends I see and talk to everyday I just feel as if we do not connect anymore).   I was wondering if this was a normal feeling for anyone else? How do you cope with the loneliness and try to connect with people?
It popped into my head the other day. I'm not sure how many people play the game on peaceful, but I know that on crappy computers, you're almost forced to.  So when villager trading came out, I got to thinking, "Hey! What if you could trade with Villagers to obtain hostile mob drops in Peaceful Mode?"   Maybe add a new Villager using that unused green villager skin that is a Hunter and trades exclusively mob drops? The only issue would be balancing it. With the addition of Pyramids, you can now find String, Gunpowder, Rotten Flesh, Bones, and Ender Pearls in very small and scattered amounts across your world, but what about things like Ghast Tears, or Spider Eyes, or Magma Cream? They're not even in Peaceful mode! So I was thinking that maybe you could trade an emerald for 13 Bones or an emerald for 8 Spider Eyes.
Hi Reddit !!! My 'friend' was at a gym point in a semi-public place (think of a train-station or a mall) and it got awkward with the 'gym owners', to clarify; it got awkward with the 2 players who were actually visibly taking over a gym from team 'opposite'.   ( interestingly:  the real folks who had pokes in the gym that were being challenged and taken over as I arrived into the whole situation never made their presence known( ;) )  during the interactions).   My friend asked respectfully; 'Hi, I don't mean to bother you, are you team 'the home team'?'. the answer was: 'no, were waiting for someone in this public place'   my friend is team "the third one" so has no side in the matter either way, and is just out there for xp, the poke stop. etc.   My friend walked around a bit, collected at a the poke stop, came back, the two trainers of team 'take-over' were gone.   My friend, ( a level 20plus of team 'third party') grabs a mid level poke to take on the first contender of the gym, and RUNS FROM THE SECOND. My friend here gains 177 xp from defeating the first slot. and begins to leave. MY FRIEND respectfully does not take over the gym outright.   when suddenly back is team 'take over'. My friend asks: 'wait, so then you guys are team 'opposite' and are back to defend ? the answer was 'no, were just here waiting for someone' and VISIBLY proceeded to reload their poke into the gym.   Great for them!!! the creepiness of saying no and acting yes  part is so obtuse though; my friend and those dudes coulda worked together;   what if the had all done the old:: 'i knock out your first guy and run from the second, u reload, we all spend some potions we need to spend anyways, walk to the poke stop, walk to hatch some eggs for a bit, : repeat.  BUT WHAT IF ITS TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE? well then just say "its time for us to leave" and then the remaining party can choose to be lame and take over the gym, or be cool about it.   I propose this: WE ARE ALL OUT THERE TO GAIN XP. Lets work together. Within team or out.   Now back to reality: AT THE VERY LEAST If its 'your gym' and you are there at the point to defend it: Just say so so I can be on my merry way... not I, my 'friend'.   We need to be civil about stops and gyms for many reasons:     BECAUSE really?  we need a reason to be civil?     FINE! So as not to lose access to these semi-public places and therefore lose the stops.  If WE DON'T CAUSE TROUBLE EVERYTHING WILL BE GOLDEN. If we do though, act weird around security guards in public places, were liable to have them simply remind us of the no pokemon go playing policy that already exists, its called: PRIVATE PROPERTY and its daughter; NO LOITERING.
My [20M] girlfriend [20F] of a couple months just moved back home from college so I'm spending the weekend at her parents house. Obviously we're going to have sex, as much as possible probably, but right now I can only think of the standard "going to the movies" excuse where you really just fuck in the car for an hour and a half and read the movie reviews so you have something to say when you get home. Her siblings will also be at the house this weekend so the old "wait until everyone's asleep" option really isn't available either. These occasional visits will be the arrangement for the rest of the summer, so waiting till we have our own place again really isn't an option. Any suggestions will be appreciated.
I don't like this constant assumption being made from these types of posts that all aclochol tastes like crap and the only reason we drink it is to get TRASHED. not true at all. I drink quite often and I drink Johnny Walker red label. ITS FUCKING DELICIOUS, I love the taste and if it wasnt for the alcoholic content I would drink it all day every day. Also when I do go out drinking with friends I'm not always getting drunk. Just having a few is enough to have fun.   To more specifically answer your question "The appeal of drinking"   It's not about the alcohol... its about who you're with. The alcohol is just an icebreaker almost, relaxes the environment, gives you something to do (besides standing there looking like an idiot). the whole environment will lighten up and just be awesome   I feel like you're grouping every person acting the same when they're drunk. This is also false. It is VERY dependent on who the people are drinking. For instance I love drinking with my group of friends. We can get drunk and have fun and we're friendly and dont piss people off and dont act like a bunch of idiots. But there are some groups of people who just get in your face and are just dumb idiots. This isnt the alcohol "creating" a new person. But just them showing how much they are naturally aware of their environment. Which leads on to the other point you mentioned... I can get wasted and still be alert of my surroundings and make responsible decisions. I have been in situtations where we've all been drunk and a fight has broke out at the bar near us and me and all the guys went into protective mode immediately and made sure our friends didnt get hit by any flying glass or random fists or anything like that.
Freshman year of university was a strained chapter in my life due to the culture shock of being at a large university and the heavy workload of my institution (began in the field of Chemistry). During this crisis, I decided that perhaps social contact would be helpful to remedy my feelings of isolation and panic - luckily, I managed to attain this thanks to the efforts of a certain person. (For the sake of this post, we will be referring to him as "A.")   "A" and I shared a number of common interests along with a similar background - plus, he served in an official capacity as a mentor of sorts for incoming STEM students (since these majors have high attrition rates at my school). Upon learning of my difficulties, he offered me the chance to meet his greater group of friends, and I gladly accepted.   This ended up resulting in mixed outcomes.   Sure, I grew close to "A" and his roommate ("H"), but despite a warm initial reception, my relationship with the other members of the group quickly worsened as my awkwardness became more apparent. This was never displayed in overt condemnation or even subtle whisperings, but I could just  feel  that everyone else was uncomfortable with me. Even now, when A/H are not with the group, I struggle to find others to speak with and mostly get ignored. After two years of being within the group, nobody from it has me added on Facebook or bothers to send texts (only "A" even knows my number). The closest thing I've had to social media contact would be two acquaintances from the group who had me added in League, and I'm no longer on very good terms with one of these individuals.   (If you're interested in how I fell from grace so quickly, please PM me for more details - it involves a certain misunderstanding that I can't divulge here without risking my identity/revealing a secret).   For a variety of reasons, my situation is looking fairly grim - my friends are all leaving this year, and I don't have anywhere else to turn after they leave. Once I graduate, I'm destined for underemployment/unemployment due to my useless liberal arts major and crappy GPA. No past romantic history or future prospects for numerous reasons. (Wide array of additional problems that I would only discuss over PM.)
Melt it using a good tempering method.  Cover yourself in it.   I used to work at this call center where the receptionist, it seemed to me, was a bit off.   As a thank you gift for something she had helped out with (meeting set up or some such bullshit), my boss asked me to go to Godiva's and get her a nice selection.  Did as told.   Upon delivering the gift to her, she opened it and looked like I had just given her a basket of live snakes.  She politely refused the gift and quietly went back to her work.   I asked an employee who knew her pretty well if she knew why the receptionist had reacted that way.  Apparently, she was a legitimate chocoholic.  Her rock bottom was when her husband found her in the kitchen late one night tempering chocolate, naked, and painting herself from head to toe in it.   To be fair, melting chocolate does smell heavenly.
Are the Explorers games TOO good?   It's almost universally accepted that Explorers of Sky is the best game in this series (with Time and Darkness behind it just because of Sky's extra content) because of the story, characters, and music. And I'll admit it, I love Explorers of Sky. The ending still gets me, even to this day. The main story had lots of interesting elements, the post story was great at expanding the details we already knew, and the amount of recruitable Pokemon was perfect for the time. Everything about that game screams amazing.   With Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon, when the game was coming out, the hype was very real for me, at least. The hunger mechanic was back, all 720 current Pokemon would be recruitable, the partner character (based on the E3 footage) was likeable, and the graphics were still just as good. After having beaten the game, I'm glad I played it. Except for a few bits (like who the overarching antagonist really is), I enjoyed the story for what it was, the gameplay is the best it has ever been, in my opinion, and a lot of the characters in the game are well-written.   Yet why do I still feel burned by the game?   To me, it comes down to a point that the Explorers games have conditioned me to expect the exact same quality for future releases. I wanted those same twists, I wanted the same music, and I wanted the absolutely gut-wrenching ending (PSMD's ending was good and definitely unexpected, but it didn't quite emotionally impact me the same way). Because I had enjoyed Explorers of Sky so much, it set me up to be burned out by both Gates to Infinity and, to a lot lesser degree, Super Mystery Dungeon. Neither game matched up to the same quality that Explorers of Sky set even though I thoroughly enjoy Super Mystery Dungeon.   Because of this, I'd say, moving forward, that the best thing to do is to now consider the Explorers games as anomalies. They are brilliant and will always be that way, but I, for one, won't look at them as the standard. It'd be great if they were, but after two games of feeling burned and looking at the precedent that Blue/Red Rescue Team established, it seems more fitting to expect quality that is at least on par with those games, if not Super Mystery Dungeon. It seems like it would be best from here on to expect a lower level of quality than what past games have given us. It seems to me that this would prevent a lot of post-game negativity and allow us to enjoy the product for what it is. It would be better to not have any comparisons and simply be blown away when we get the chance, but that is a difficult step, especially given how blown away people were by Explorers of Sky.   So,

I'm not actually at risk of committing suicide but need to know what I should do. Recently my prescription was changed from 20mg to 10mg and it feels about the same except for what was mentioned earlier and I'm at college so I have no option but to keep taking it, is there anything that I could do to minimize some of this without stopping my use of it?
I've never been on a date before...and only had one boyfriend. we started out as good friends, immediate chemistry, and he broke up with his girlfriend for me after a week of knowing me. He was smitten, and we dated for 6 years. When we first started dating it immediately became awkward since i didnt know what was expected of me as a gf, and because he was clearly more serious about me than i was about him.   it took several months to shake the awkwardness, and it took me a long time to fall in love with him. We've been broken up for 2 years and would casually hook up from time to time, and we actually got along better in this set up than when we dated. We havent spoken in over a year, and he's getting married and having his first baby.   Meanwhile, I havent met anyone i've wanted to date since him, and generally just dont feel romantic feelings for anyone. Im over my first boyfriend, but feel nothing romantically for others.   I've been close to male friends where i wouldnt mind being fwb since i like that whole casual hanging out thing and feel a lot of lust on the rare occasions i meet a guy im attracted to.  and while ive loved some of my male friends, i've never been in love after my first boyfriend..   I've been asked out on dates by non-guy friends, just random guys, but never felt much connection or chemistry, so i say no.   What does an emotional/romantic connection feel like? How will I know?
Hello /r/AskReddit! So today I've got a question to ask you guys and what you guys think I should do regarding this, so in advance thanks for anyone who even reads this!   So the last few weeks we've been leading up to my School Fair, where the community comes together blah blah. Every year the school has an assembly where the nominees for school fair King & Queen for 9th through 12th create a skit around a specific topic, and it's all fun and games to get votes.   Well today we had the assembly, the theme's this year are the 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's. The seniors go, nothing too spectacular, or even funny to be completely honest. Juniors go, theirs is a bit funny, mostly laughing at my friend who had to dress up as a sheriff. Sophomores go theirs is messed up by the tech guy playing the wrong song, but they still kept going.  Then  the freshmen went.   So they came out with a "dating game" and had people "impersonating" the other candidates, it's not the first time and it's usually fun and games, nothing too bad. They completely bashed them. To give an example, my friend let's call her Julie is a cheerleader and is dating the popular basketball guy. In the skit they made her out to be obsessed with her boyfriend even going far as to the line of asking if you had a nick name what would it be, "Mrs. sdhajdha", then having him walk across the room and her fall out of her seat and jump at him.   The second was a joke about my friend let's call him Brian, he is a gamer, tech geek like myself. The segment with his character was that he sat in his mom's basement playing video games, he does nothing, and his mom does everything for him. Obviously to some of you this might just be normal "High Schooler stuff" we all have to go through, but given that when these jokes were being made the staff did nothing to stop it, when it was clearly hurting peoples feelings, and that teachers themselves helped make the skits.   So my question is was my school allowing kids to bully others? I personally really think it was, and this wouldn't be the first time either. To get off topic in 7th grade I was bullied, told the teachers constantly, they did nothing. When I defended myself I was suspended, expelled, put on probation, and the bully got nothing at all. So reddit is this them allowing bullying, and should I confront the school board about this?   Like I said to some of you guys this may seem stupid or "that's how the school system is" but i'd just really like some opinions. Thank you very much!
You'll have to forgive me for copying and pasting this from a previous thread, but I don't want to rewrite this (went through 5 years of that):   From   "I figure that the chances of the OP reading my message with this many comments is pretty low, but there's a better chance that you will read my words and benefit.   My situation was the same as the OP. Got married, then had problems. I was extremely frustrated to say the least. I had no idea what the problem was for a long time, and as you've said, this isn't exactly something that you can discuss with friends and family. Eventually I did some research and found out about vaginismus. That was a good first step. We got the treatment kit from vaginismus.com, which I'm 99% sure is the one that the OP is talking about.   Things looked promising, it seemed like there was finally some hope. So we try the Q-tip thing. That was very painful for her, but she managed it. She tried and tried the smallest dialator, probably once a week for a couple of weeks. She struggled, and struggled. I basically offered her bribes if she could do it (as encouragement). It wasn't working though, so we quit that.   Her gynecological appointments were traumatic for her, involving screaming. The OBGYN was not at all helpful about the vaginismus problems.   Occasionally we would still try to have sex, but it was rather infrequent, given that it pretty much always ended up with crying and guilt and huge amounts of frustration. Of course she wasn't very interested in sex, but a good part of that is that it must have been physically about the equivalent of being getting kicked hard in the balls repeatedly, then feeling guilty about it.   We had talked about trying to see other medical specialists to see if they could help. We didn't for a long while. I think a big part of that was just the sheer embarassment of having to talk with other people about such problems, on top of extreme levels of frustration.   Eventually though, my frustration had reached a high enough level that I just figured "Embarassment be damned, I want sex", so I brought up the idea of seeking professional help again, and was very insistent upon it. So we ended up making an appointment with a psychologist who specialized in sex issues. It was very awkward at first, since the people handling setting up the appointments want an idea of why you are there. Then you have to talk to a complete stranger about these embarassing problems that you have been having. It's very awkward for you at first. Then you start to realize that for them, discussing these things is very normal and not at all embarassing (the person told me that as part of the training, each psychologist had to describe their own sex life in extreme detail in front of the class, to start getting themselves over the usual embarassment of talking about sex with strangers).   The psychologist helped by trying to break us out of the negative cycle that we were in. Because of the past bad experiences, my wife would automatically become even more tense in her muscles, tightening up, which just made insertion even more impossible. So he worked on trying to help us break out of the bad psychological cycle that we were in. It helped calm me down though (both from trying to relax and not push my wife as much, but also knowing that we were at least working on the problem). It didn't help at all physically.   After the first couple of sessions though, he addressed this. He didn't know of anyone in the area who specialized in the physical side of vaginismus, so he called around to some of his colleagues in nearby cities who were also psychologists who specialized in sexual matters. One of them recommended to him a physical therapist who specialized in such matters. Unfortunately, that physical therapist was 100 miles away.   So, 100 miles each way, but you might eventually get sex out of it. What do you do? Get on the road.   The physical therapist was a really nice lady. She did a brief physical exam on my wife to start with, but was extremely sensative to my wife's pain, and made sure not to do anything that my wife was uncomfortable with. She explained that there are 2 main potential parts to such pain. The first is just from the muscles tensing up. The second part though is the skin. In some people it's apparently super sensative down there. So there are creams and such that can be used to help address that (such as the Lidocaine that ViamnotacrookV mentioned). Part of the reason for looking at this is that it is very hard to address any muscle issues if your skin is so sensative that it is causing your muscles to tense up. The physical therapist mentioned that there was an RN that she worked with that specialized in the skin aspects, if that turned out to also be needed (as the physical therapist only deals with the muscles).   Anyway, the physical therapist initially gave her exercises to do first and discussed diet with us (specifically adding in a lot of extra fiber, because the muscles down there are also connected to the bladder, so having a lot of extra stuff in your bladder makes those muscles have to be doing more).   During the first visit, she talked to us about getting dialators. We mentioned that we already had some (the ones from the vagismus book/website). She seemed to be familiar with them. So the next time, she got us started working with those again. She addressed the position with which my wife should work with them, and really emphasized that we needed to work with the dialators every day (although we could take a few days off once a month...). This was one of our big mistakes we made when we tried it on our own previously. We would just try using a dialator like once a week, and made no progress. During the physical therapy sessions, my wife would be under a blanket with the dialator, and she would be hooked up to some electrodes that were placed on her upper thigh area. The machine then was set to display how hard the muscles were working. The point was for my wife to see that feedback, and to try to work on relaxing the muscles while working with the dialator.   The physical therapist gave us samples of several different lubricants to try using. We eventually found on our own that a completely different lubricant seemed to work best for her (Astroglide X, which is different from regular Astroglide).   For working with the dialator at home, we would use it every day. My wife would get a glass of wine, to just try to relax and make it a slightly more pleasant experience. She would control the dialator, but she used it on the bed, and I would be next to her. I would have my iPad out, and we'd watch something from Netflix on it (my wife liked this as it helped keep her mind off of the dialator so much, since without this distraction she would tend to think about the dialator and her muscles would then just tense up).   So has the 100 mile (each way) trip been worth it? Absolutely.   Things started to go better. After about 2 weeks, she was able to get the smallest dialator in. We kept making the trip to the physical therapist, going once a week for about 2-3 months. After that, we dropped down to every 2 weeks. My wife progressed in using the larger dialators slowly, and now eventually we've managed intercourse (and she enjoys it!).   My wife is now slowly transitioning from hating anything sexual and not wanting to even try having sex, to even slowly starting to intiate things herself.   While the psychologist helped me initially relax and take the pressure off of my wife, quite honestly, it was the progress with the dialators and physical therapy that really started dropping my frustration.
8th Grade we have this new English teacher. He's pretty young, most of us like him because he is chill. However he would have really bad days where he acted hung over or something and yelled a lot, mainly at me cause I was a smart ass generally.   Anyways, we get through the year and we think fairly highly of him because he represented a party lifestyle that we were all dreaming of at the time (known to be a huge partier in college, hung his frat stuff on the walls of the class).   Years down the road, I'm Sophomore in High school and attend a special off campus part of the school (it was at a zoo). There's a girl there that was known to be a little promiscuous and wasn't very attractive however the teachers loved her (the teachers/students were really close there). Turns out her and our beloved 8th grade English teacher were having a relationship..(she was part of his softball team) and was selling cocaine for him. Apparently he dealt and did cocaine with her while having a relationship.   He gets booked for drugs and being a pedophile (she had 2 weeks to turn 18).  Then it starts running a little deeper as it turns out the teachers at the sub school knew about it but didn't do anything (not the drugs though). So all of their jobs are apparently on the line but then the awesome secretary we loved takes the complete fall and quits.   Meanwhile another guy at the sub school was getting charged with rape and sexual assault for having sex with another slut in a car. It was completely consensual but she was in a relationship so took the easy way out of charging him.   It was kinda weird, we had cops at the little school of about 100 or so every day for a few days. Drama ended up costing the sub school it's freedom and it changed dramatically next year.   Proof:
Answers to your questions, in order.     Would you like your name and address posted on the Internet?   Don't know   No   No, they're pushing for nationwide reciprocity for permit holders, most of which are concealed permit holders, which means they are not going to be "displaying" their firearm publicly.   It is not the same. Question does not apply   Please rephrase this statement in the form of a question.   Not necessary. A crazy shooter/mass murderer already knows where to find the best locations. There's a sign on the front door that reads "Gun Free Zone"
The context of the conversation went along the lines of: A gay man doesn't flaunt that he is gay. A faggot is feminine, wears make up, carries a purse, calls everyone bitch, is generally rude, ect. That people should think before they called certain gays "faggots".   I said that Men that are feminine, wear make-up, are straight, gay, bi whatever, are people and don't deserve to be treated like that. And that regardless of sexual orientation or gender anyone that is overly rude or calls people bitch is what I like to call an asshole.   Then he tells me that he is gay (I didn't know) And that just because I say calling someone a faggot is immoral won't make people stop saying it. (Well yes, I'm very aware of this) He was just tired of people calling him a faggot. So pretty much it seems like he just told me, I'm tired of people calling me a faggot...so here's a list of traits that qualifies you to call other people a faggot.   Should I have just not said anything? I try to be very open and friendly about everyone and sometimes I feel like I'm standing up for someone when that person is acting like I just stepped on their balls.
You all are only partially correct. To start with, counting cards comes in many forms but most systems keep track of the ratio of 10 value cards to the value of cards 6 or less with 7-9 being ignored because they have a neutral effect on the outcome. One thing that people fail to mention is that people that count also play using perfect blackjack strategy.  Most of a casino's advantage comes from player mistakes, it's not built into the game like it is with other games.  So, a majority of a counter's advantage actually comes from playing correctly (taking the house advantage from roughly 2.5% to about .5%) and counting takes it from .5% in the houses favor to about .25% in the players favor. This is due to the fact that the player has a choice on whether or not they hit (and possibly bust) but the house must hit anything below a hard 17. A players hand wins if they are still in the game and the dealer busts. There is also a very slight advantage gain when insurance is offered because a counter has a better knowledge of the probability of a dealer blackjack.
I've played quite a bit of this game, I invested before they even had a playable version.   It's very much worth giving it a go even at this stage, you can get used to all the mechanics of the game, build a little fortress, go exploring and foraging etc, and basic crafting is already implemented.   I got a little bored of it after playing it solidly for about a week, but once the new updates are made and some new features added I'll be going back to it.
So it's been about 2 weeks since Ekko has been released. While he is a really fun champion, he is overtuned and will need some slight to moderate nerfs on his abilities. Here's a list of nerfs that keep the identity of a "time-based utility assassin" while keeping him manageable. A "utility assassin" should not be a lane bully or safe in lane and should have tradeoffs between the laning phase and the late game. Essentially, less damage early but keep his utility and damage relatively the same. If he gets to survive the laning phase, then he should be able to do damage and bring utility to teamfights. Many people are complaining about his immense damage on his ult and his utility on his W while disregarding the fact that there is counterplay to those mechanics. They're overtuned, yes, but there is more counterplay to these spells if people are cognizant of Ekko's abilities. (These are a list of options rather than continuous nerfs. )   Passive: Z- Drive Resonance  - Ekko's damaging abilities and basic attacks build up Resonance stacks on his enemies, lasting up to 4 seconds. At 3 stacks the target takes 「 15 + (12 × Ekko's level) 」(+ 70% AP) bonus magic damage and is  slowed by 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% for 2 / 2.5 / 3 seconds. Z-Drive Resonance's bonus damage will apply spell effects. Z-Drive Resonance cannot affect the same target more than once every few seconds. Against champions, Ekko also gains bonus movement speed equal in strength and duration to the Slow icon slow .   My thoughts and reasoning: His passive is responsible for a majority of his damage and safety. In lane, Ekko usually gets 3 procs of his passive then runs out with the movement speed. The damage that he gets early is far too much and the movement speed steal is too high, leading into a relatively safe laning phase.     Decrease base damage or AP Ratio   Nerf the movement speed steal early on  while keeping it the same at later ranks (EX: 15/30/50/70/80% movement speed)   Increase the cooldown on the same target or have the damage reduced on the same target on additional procs.     Q: Timewinder  ACTIVE: Ekko throws a device in a target direction, dealing magic damage to all enemies along its path. At maximum range or if it hits an enemy champion, the device slows to a stop and expands, creating a Slow icon slowing field. OUTGOING MAGIC DAMAGE: 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 (+ 20% AP) SLOW: 32 / 39 / 46 / 53 / 60% After a short delay, the device contracts and rushes back to Ekko, dealing additional magic damage to all enemies along its path. 「 INCOMING MAGIC DAMAGE: 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 / 160 (+ 60% AP) 」   Thoughts: Good skill and has clear and cut counterplay. There isn't much of reason to nerf it but there are a couple of options.     Transfer damage from the first part of the skill to the 2nd part   Straight up nerf the scaling slow or remove it completely.     Reasoning: First nerf makes hitting the second part of the Q much more important than before. It is relatively easy to hit the first Q in lane while difficult to hit the 2nd Q, nerfing his reliable damage in trades and harass. 2nd nerf targets his slow utility as he already has relatively strong utility from his passive.   W:Parallel Convergence  - PASSIVE: Ekko's basic attacks deal 5%「 (+ 1.81% per 100 AP) 」of target's missing health as bonus magic damage (Capped at 150 vs. minions / monsters) versus targets below 30% of their maximum health. ACTIVE: Ekko calls upon an alternate version of himself that bats a device to the target location. After a total delay of 3 seconds, the device expands into a broad sphere that slows enemies by 40%. Enemies do not gain vision of the target area until the last 0.5 seconds. If Ekko enters the sphere, it detonates, granting him a shield for 2 seconds while stunning all enemies inside for 2.25 seconds. Ekko can detonate the sphere while dead and while in Stasis. SHIELD STRENGTH: 150 / 195 / 240 / 285 / 330 (+ 80% AP)   Thoughts: Here's the skill that many people complain about. However, the difficulty of predicting and landing it is massively understated on reddit. Contrarily, the reward for landing it is way too rewarding for what you risk. The passive portion is justified as you should be rewarded for staying in range of enemies as a squishy melee.     Increase mana costs   Scaling stun   Increase the time at which enemies can see the target area   Slight nerf on AP ratio on shield     Reasoning: His W just has too much utility for the amount of mana it costs. Additionally, the 2.25 second aoe stun is too influential in early skirmishing and teamfights in the midgame. Also, the .5 seconds you have to react is not exactly enough to encourage counterplay with its size (Veigar stun isn't even as good). A nerf on his shield might be unnecessary but it is an option.   E:  Phase Dive  - Ekko dashes towards a target location. His next basic attack within the next few seconds gains 300 bonus attack range (425 total range) and causes Ekko to blink on his target, dealing bonus magic damage. Phase Dive's bonus damage will apply spell effects. BONUS MAGIC DAMAGE: 50 / 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 (+ 20% AP)   Thoughts: I honestly don't think this ability is a massive problem. The damage is exaggerated by many and a gap closer is definitely needed on a melee assassin. However, if there is one thing to nerf it would be to...     Nerf the amount of time you have to use the blink     Reasoning: It increases Ekko's difficulty and doesn't allow you to chase easier.   R: Chronoshift - PASSIVE: Ekko is followed by a time-delayed hologram of himself that tracks where he was 4 seconds ago. The hologram is inactive while Chronobreak is on cooldown. ACTIVE: After a short delay, Ekko blinks to wherever he was 4 seconds ago, dealing magic damage to surrounding enemies and healing Ekko for a value equal to flat amount plus a percentage of all damage taken over the last 4 seconds. MAGIC DAMAGE: 200 / 350 / 500 (+ 130% AP) HEAL: 100 / 150 / 200 (+ 20 / 25 / 30%「 (+ 3.33% per 100 AP) 」of damage taken).   Thoughts: I know this is unpopular, but I feel that the damage is honestly justified. If you stand on his ult indicator, than by all means you should be punished for it. However, the heal that Ekko gets is not fun to play against. You are essentially discouraged to attack him when he has ult up as he could heal a good chunk back.     Increase the start up time for Ekko's ult (not a good nerf imo)    Scaling AP Ratio Heal   Or Increase Base but lower Percent and AP Ratio of the heal     Reasoning: If we increase the start up time for Ekko's ult, it allows for more counterplay but it introduces more clunkiness into his kit which is not optimal for player experience. The scaling AP ratio heal allows for his late game to stay intact while once again, nerfing his laning. The other option is the just nerf the heal overall but mitigate the nerf's impact by buffing the Base heal.   Ending thoughts: I love playing Ekko and his style of playing. The predictions and awareness needed to play this champion introduce a high skill cap champ that gives a chance to outplay the opponent. However, because he is so stacked with utility and damage, Riot needs to either reduce the utility and damage or make him even more vulnerable in lane so that he isn't as safe to pick up in every matchup. However, these are my thoughts and feel free to disagree! Comment on what you agree or disagree with or add in your own points!
okay so i will try to make this quick to avoid excessive reading time.   My girlfriend and I have been dating since we were juniors in highschool. we fell in love hard and pretty fast within the first few weeks.   once a year since our second year dating she has broken up with me for a period of time. usually 6-10 weeks. we always get back together though. this past year though she cheated on me with a friend (no longer a friend) he's actually one of the shittiest people ever to be honest. Anyway though, she had said it was a horrible drunken mistake and she didnt expect me to ever forgive her but she got down on her knees and begged me to stay with her and I accepted because I really love her dearly.   fast forward to today about 8 months later, she wakes up on wednesday crying and decides to tell me she doesnt think we should be together. and she promises she would never leave me and she was positive i was the one.   now, I know what you are all thinking- gf breaks up once a year, this is an obvious answer blah blah blah.   here's the kicker though, roughly 90% of the time, she's wonderful and our relationship at least feels wonderful.she tells me she loves me multiple times a day every single day. tell's me pretty often how happy she is we will be together forever. but it seems once a year she does a complete 180 and its as if im talking to a different girl than the one i know. She'll start saying hurtful things, tell me she just doesnt feel the 'spark' anymore. I told her a long term relationship takes work and it flame doesn't stay lit by itself so to speak, you need to add more butane. what else is tricky is that we live together, she's staying at her parents currently until we decide what to do.   in the past i've been very strategic about what my moves would be during this time of limbo. but this time im thinking of just letting it play out naturally. I can't picture life without this girl i love her to death and I know she loves me she's showed it and made it very clear. so im now sure what to do.   any ideas?
It was cheesy 80s horror movie creepy but here it is... I checked into this smaller older hotel in my capital city. It was in that style, common before cookie cutter hotel chains or deluxe upmarket skyscraper hotels, where you have reception and the elevators at one end and the fire exit at the other, connecting them was one single long windowless corridor with small rooms either side. Built as small independent businesses they are usually only about six to eight floors.   I was told I was on the 3rd floor in a room about two thirds of the way down.  Ok too, low for a view of anything but the next hotel, too high for easy entry or escape.   Also, the building and that floor in particular was being renovated so the place won't look it's best and there would be workmen and some noise in the day but not at night and some building materials about.  Fair enough, I wasn't going to be there in the day really anyway.   Actually, you'll be the only guest on that floor... At this point I was hoping he would stop talking, surely the next revelation could only involve deep gouges in the exposed flooring and a missing worker.  Instead he grinned sheepishly at me and handed me a big old style key on a big old style tag.   I took the lift up and got out into what appeared to be a movie set.  In front of me was the long windowless hall I expected. Slightly depressing. However it was completely silent and deserted. Odd. There were building materials here and there, paint rollers and buckets and such and the appearance of building dust or plaster everywhere. Annoying but expected. I looked down to where my room should be and, no lie, the area was lit by a flickering wall light. Flicker flicker black flicker. Really?   In fact the entire corridor looked dimmer than it should, it took me a moment to realise why. I had been so enamoured by the other charms of my abode I had not noticed the entire ceiling of the corridor, along with it's lights was missing. All of the light was coming from the feeble decorative wall lamps. In the ceilings place were sheets of semi opaque builders plastic, bowed slightly in the centre, as even fixed tight to the sides they were. after all. flimsy. Since no one was here the plastic was still as a grave and as grey as everything else and I hadn't noticed it. Perhaps the worst were the places that weren't covered, somehow they were inky black and seemed to go back further than they should.   All in all, the carefully abandoned work material, the drab powdery grey everywhere, the flickering light the walls without ceilings and the silence gave it all a very very surreal feeling. I was a roll of police tape, some studio junkies and Rutger Hauer away from a post apocalyptic sci fi; one asian school girl away from a horror and most frighteningly one Taylor Dayne and fog machine away from an 80s music video.   I sighed inwardly and trundled my luggage towards my dim door with the big key tight in one hand; if Sakura dropped from one of the dark voids she was going to get such a poking before I voided myself.   Quietly, rustle rustle, a bit behind me, like a creature in leaves I knew there was no one there as I had not gone more than a few metres and had heard neither the lift return nor any other doors open. I ignored it and walked slightly faster.  Rustle rustle. Slightly louder. Slightly closer.  I walked a bit faster again.  Rustle Rustle.  Louder. Closer. I'm now moving at what can only be described as "briskly" and the rustling is keeping up.  I'm speed walking down a dim corridor, towards an area of intermittent darkness, on a floor I know is deserted and the noise is gaining. It's almost right on top of me now, it's louder again and no longer sounds like a rustle, it sounds more like wings, not feathered, skin wings, big skin wings.  Nope. Nope nope nope.   I look at my rapidly approaching door, I'm trying to work out how to turn 90 degrees, open an old door lock, open an old door, go through same, close and bolt it without losing speed and being arrested/murdered/sung at. I glance at the fire exit and briefly consider cruising past my room and gaining the freedom of the outside, to hell with the alarm and the fire brigade and this hotel. No, no good, in the movie you always open that door and Christopher Lambert/Sakuras twin/Michael Jackson is grinning and waiting.  I wonder if I abandon my bag will it trip Rutger?  He's getting on in years, he might break a hip but I'll be safe. Does the monster ever trip? I don't think so and then I also won't have my other briefs which I think I may need soon.  I utter a strangled noise, in a strangely disjointed yet graceful lurch I stab the key into the lock, wrench my entire body sideways to turn the key but it's too late, it's right there, the noise is on me.  I turn to look back, wanting to cry in frustration, the handle of my pull along is too weak to let me flip up the bag to use as a shield; and my stabbing key is now stuck in this damn lock. Sakura be merciful, be swift.   Nothing is there, the hall is empty.   The noise is RIGHT behind me again.   I try to swing the bag around but the hall's too narrow, I can't let go of the key or get it out of the lock, my head spins around like an owl. Nothing is there. But the sound is moving away toward the force exit, getting quieter.   I sigh and look up.   The sheeting.   The fecking plastic builders sheeting.   Mocking me, it catches in another tiny breeze (possibly from my swearing) and Rustles quietly.   As I had moved down the still hall, I had displaced enough air to push up on the hanging plastic and make it rustle. The faster I went, the more gutsily my passing and the louder and closer to me the sheeting moved.  At the end I was moving so fast I was pushing the air in front of me like a subway train and making the noise directly over my head. When I stopped the disturbance continued down the hall and petered out.   At least that's what I told myself.   This same hotel had footsteps in the hall at night when no one else should have been there, there was no room service so I continue to hope it was staff on night patrol but that's a story for another time.

I was lucky to find the 1050W power supply on craigslist new and sealed (some woman in a tech company had received an even stronger power supply as a gift so she never ended up opening the 1050W thermaltake and she sold it to me :) ) I could have said on the keyboard and mouse but it matched by case and was definitely better than my old ones. I could have waited for cheaper SSD prices as well. I didn't buy a graphics card yet, but I am planning to around these times or maybe waiting for Cyber Monday. I installed Windows 8.1 using a usb drive as I didn't want any mechnical disk drives. Also got 3 cooler master ball bearing fans from a friend and put those in.   My impressions: 1) Holy moly PC bootup is about 7 seconds from pressing the power button into desktop. My desktop is on a table right by my bed so I wake up groggy, hit the power button and in 7 seconds I'm ready to play games or surf the internet in my PJ's.   2) I fit Windows 8.1, Microsoft Office (Word, Ppt, Excel, OneNote), League of Legends, Dark Souls 1 Prepare to Die Edition, Dark Souls 2, and I still have a little more than half the space left.   3) Gaming Performance: I run on an old 1600 x 900 monitor atm. I run League of Legends all settings Max with anti aliasing and I get 70 fps. My load times also cut from about 2 minutes to around 30 seconds (waiting for the other people). Dark Souls 2 runs AMAZING. I can turn textures and character models to high as well as a couple other settings. I can't turn environment settings any higher though. However I run at 30-40fps all the time.   This is all with integrated graphics on my cpu. Absolutely amazing. And it looks better than the console version of Dark Souls 2 despite having no video card...for controls I just plug in a wired 360 controller.   4) I am running on stock intel cooler and 4 case fans. CoreTemp gives me temperatures of around 26-29C while idle/web browsing. Playing Dark Souls it goes to 46C when I am fighting large mobs, but usually is in the 30's.   5) I realize I don't need a power supply that big. But considering it was gold certified, modular and $60 sealed I couldn't pass it up. I also realize I don't need the z87 as it seems to be an overclocking board from what I can find on google, but it came with a pretty good bundle with the ram so I jumped on it. $90 before rebate $80 after was too good with 8gb 1 stick ram.   Future Purchases: 1) A better monitor. Not too important for me atm, but it would be nice to get full HD or above.   2) VIDEO CARD. I want to jump at this ASAP. Anytime from now to the next 2-3 months. Anyone know how to look for deals on these?   3) Bigger SSD? It is not too important at the moment. I don't really accumulate music, movies or videos and I only play around 3 games on steam at a time.
Hello everyone! Very new to this forum, but I'm hoping that you all may be able to provide some insights into my relationship.   My BF and I began dating in college, and have been together almost 5 years now. Before I get too far, I want to say that we DO have sex regularly, and have had sex throughout our relationship. However, I have a much higher sex drive than my BF, do more of the initiating, and am generally more interested in sex and fantasies than he is. About a year into our relationship, my BF drunkenly confessed to me that he has never liked porn, and found it "disturbing". He said he always felt like something was wrong with him for not liking it, and he used to try to make himself watch it in high school so he could be normal, but he just couldn't stand it. He said that because of this, he was always scared he would never like sex. I really didn't see the big deal, although I do like porn.   About 2 years into our relationship, I discovered that he didn't quite tell the whole truth about not liking porn. I was home alone at his place, and trying to download a video on his computer that explained how to unclog a drain. When I went to his downloads folder to find the video, I saw some odd-looking videos. I opened them, and they were bondage videos, but definitely not sexual. I was really shocked, and snooped through his computer to find an entire folder with bondage videos and pictures (bad nosy GF move, I know). The typical video would show a fully-clothed girl tied up, usually hog-tied and gagged and laying on the ground, kind of rolling around and trying to get free. No one else was in the videos, so there was no sex, pain, anything at all. Just a clothed girl tied up.   I asked him about the folder, and he tried to deny it at first, but later told me that he had liked things like that for as long as he could remember, and it was the only thing he had ever liked to touch himself to (actually this isn't totally true--he touches himself to pictures of girls with their stomachs showing, like in crop tops). He said he really hated that he liked it, but couldn't help it.   I suggested incorporating bondage into the bedroom, but he confirmed what I already knew: the bondage, although he masturbated to it, was not sexual. There was no way for him to make it sexual with me, and he was not interested in trying it with me.   As far as the rest of our sex life, it's consistent but boring. We have sex maybe once or twice a week, but he will NEVER do more than one position in a session because he loses his erection. He's very affectionate, and loves cuddling, so we're really quite intimate.   I know he's probably not fully asexual, but I'm wondering if he's maybe sort of asexual?--we DO have sex, but now I'm wondering if he actually truly enjoys the sexual aspect of it or just the physical release? (Based on him being so repulsed by porn)   Also, he keeps a journal where every year, he writes down his goals for the year as well as what he was thankful for the previous year (he shared this with me, I didn't snoop). Every year since we got together, he writes "sexual connection with [my name]" as something he's thankful for. I thought it was odd, because, like, it's JUST sex. What's the big deal? But now I'm wondering if maybe its such a big deal for him because it's a new thing for him--kind of like how he said he thought he would never like sex based on his reaction to porn. Maybe experiencing a sexual connection is something he never thought would happen?   Sorry for the long post, I just feel that there's  something  off about this whole thing. Sex is just a very important part of relationships to me, so I'd like to understand him better in this regard. It has also caused some misunderstandings and fights in the past, and I think if I understood him better it would make things easier.
Well, thanks to OhaiItsAhmad, we know Naruto Storm 3 has been announced.   I hope it's real, I really do. I just wanted to share my opinions on what I think the game should include, and fix. First, I would love to Jutsu Clashes again. I know, it might be hard to incorporate. But, I think that they should use the jutsu system from Naruto Storm 1. For people who don't know, like this.   I think that it could work, please tell me if i'm wrong. Secondly, they need to find a median between Naruto Storm 2 and Naruto Storm Generations. In Naruto Storm 2, the story was incredible. The boss battles and storytelling were great. But the multiplayer was lacking compared to Naruto Storm Generations. In Naruto Storm 3, i'd like to see a great story and a great multiplayer. The third thing is kinda stretched but, it'd be nice to see. If anyone here has played Naruto: The Broken Bond, you'll remember the team battles. It was 2v2 and you could swap out with your partner whenever you felt like it. I feel like this would be a nice addition. The ability to have a 3v3 battle, and being able to swap between you and your friends. And the last thing is kind of me just hoping too much but, i'd love to see a character creation. Again, probably wont happen but still.
So basically, our chemistry is off. We got married at the end of December, and had one glorious bedroom romp the night of, but he's been unable to consummate the marriage since. He can get an erection, but as soon as I start getting Randy back, he loses it.   I've been very supportive. At first I tried to get him going again, to no avail, so I moved on to just cuddling and loving him when it's clear he's not going anywhere. When he has relaxed a bit, we talk about it. I tried giving it a few days and letting him come to me when he's ready, I've tried jumping him in the morning when he has his morning visitor, and nothing has worked.   Tonight, it came to a head. He's clearly upset about it (understandably) but I just couldn't deal, I cried, I was worried it was me. We've only had one other stint like this and it only lasted about a week. Before the wedding, we were doing it 2-3 times a week. He finally told me that he feels like he can't please me, but that's all I've gotten from him.   Oh Reddit, what do I do? I love this man with all my heart, and I don't want him to feel like this anymore.
I opened the original file I edited and had it side by side on my screen with the IMGUR file and took a screen shot just for you.   [Proof](   Of course, I posted this new image back to IMGUR and it made everything darker again making the imgur image look even worse than it actually does and making my edit look like the imgur image.
How do you climb past rank 10 without decks that have many legendaries and rares and so on so forth? I don't spend money on the game and I play from time to time so I have a few cards but not some of the better ones out there. I do craft recommended cards that I see online and my only legendaries are the beast and prophet velen. Prophet Velen is awesome but he is pretty situational and when I go against decks with ragnaros, jaraxxus, doctor boom and etc etc I just get frustrated.
My neighbour seems like a nice woman, a bit of a gossip, but friendly and approachable none-the-less. The trouble is her family. She's a grandmother and she has 3-4 grandkids plus her daughters and sons-in-law around literally every day even though they don't live there.   One thing that's kind of annoying is we have to park in the street, there's no driveways, and the fact this family takes up 4 car parking spaces for one household each day is kind of irritating. Like today, I was out of the house for 10 minutes dropping my OH off at work, I came back, and the daughter had moved her car forward into the space I was parked, so the other daughter could fit her car in front of my house. One of the daughters was rude enough to ask me to move my car so they could park there so they could be closer to the house to bring the kids in once as well. They are as entitled to park there as I am, it's just really annoying.   And the kids are so loud. They play in the garden all day for hours, which is expected, it's summer, the kids are now off school. But even with the windows closed I can hear them constantly screaming and shouting. I work nights and it's really disrupting my sleep. Obviously I don't expect them to be tiptoeing around but they are extremely loud, louder than most kids I hear playing out.   Should I mention something to my neighbour? I know me saying anything will give her ammo to bitch and gossip about and I don't want it to cause any trouble. But I'm hoping it could make them be a little more considerate. Or should I just grin and bear it, they're not doing anything to deliberately disturb me, I just think they are very inconsiderate.
EDIT: Original comment had a lot of frothy rage, this is a less rage-y, more condensed version:   Curse is all about monetising the userbase - through encouraging content creation through shared revenue and by using a client that shows ads. That's why the client is Windows-only, it's all about maximising revenue while minimising expenses (like support).   Personally (as a modder, not for KSP, though), modding is a lot about the community, seeing your vision/idea in a game realised and the collaboration. Monetisation very much destroys/discourages that and having something like that driven by a company like curse that cares more about the revenue than actually fostering a thriving community adds to that.
If a tiny minority of people are assholes that doesn't make the entire group assholes, that doesn't make the entire groups beliefs asshole-ish. There are some assholes among the human race, that doesn't make the human race assholes.   Most of the things you've stated are done  in the name  of religion. Religion (and many other things such as status, race etc) has been used as a weapon to oppress throughout history, it has been used as justification for wars throughout history. It is wrong to single out religion as the lone cause of this.   Do you honestly believe if Jesus or Muhammad were alive right now they would defend honor killings, the crusades, the Inquisition, organized child rape, indoctrination, sexism or whatever else is done in their name? You have to understand that for their time Jesus and Muhammad were the progressive, free thinkers of their time just as atheists are today. Jesus opposed war and conflict, he died in opposition to the invading, occupying Roman Empire. Muhammad was distraught with the pagan beliefs and practices of the time such as honor killing, sacrifice and sexism and he sought to open peoples eyes to the horror of these practices. They both opposed ritualistic and often batshit crazy pagan ideas that were tools of oppression by power hungry rulers only to eventually have their own ideas adopted by the same oppressive and power seeking rulers thousands of years later.
I have been seeing a delightful fellow for the past four months. It's not difficult for me to get dates, but most guys rarely make it past the first 2-4. When I get hung up on someone, I get very hung up indeed. In the past, this has caused me to either ignore potential problems that I saw coming a mile away, or to compromise heavily on my end for the sake of the other person's happiness—often with nothing in return.   I'm not going to lie; I want to settle down with someone. Given that, I've been trying steadily over the past two years to more honestly evaluate people and their long-term potential. My specified love interest is not perfect, but he is confident, logical, compassionate, and shares with me a great affinity for art as a lifelong pursuit. There are far more positives for me to list than negatives. After I'd known him a month, he told me that he loved me. This scared me a little, but it also intrigued me. He said it so calmly, and to the best I could tell, he was sincere. Over the past couple months, I've allowed myself to openly fall for him. I let my guard down, and that wasn't easy for me. I told him I loved him also, I introduced him to my family, I showed him the town where I'm from... I began sharing my hopes and dreams to him. Yesterday, I was really excited. I had checked my credit and found that I suddenly qualified for far better financing terms than I did a year ago. I don't particularly want to rent, as I think buying would be a far investment. I had been doing some research and found a little house in the country that I was excited about, and I sent him over a link, asking his honest opinion. Since I tend to get swept up in possibilities, I wanted to know if I was being unrealistic in my appreciation for what the house had to offer.   That's where the conversation took a weird turn. He mentioned that I was too young to have my heart set on a house in the country, that I should wait until I was much older before I made a move like that. (Quick background info: I already live out in the boondocks with my parents, where we've lived for over a decade. He lives in a townhouse in a nearby city, right in the middle of downtown.) He absolutely had a point, and I was ready to consider it. After all, the home was very small. What happened when I was ready to upgrade? It would be difficult to sell or rent in such a remote area. But when it came down to it, I told him I just couldn't see myself living in a city long-term. He quickly answered that he couldn't see himself living anywhere -but- the city long-term. At this point, I've got a huge lump in my throat. Bare minimum, I want to live in a house with a yard and a workshop in a neighborhood I'm not afraid to walk around alone outside at night. I am  vastly  more comfortable in the country than  I am in a busy downtown area. I ask him if this is a deal-breaker for him. He says, "No", but then mentions that I have a point. We continue to hash it out.   At the end of the conversation, we determine that it would be selfish for either one of us to ask the other one to give up what they wanted. The most mature thing to do was to call it quits before we got in any deeper. The thing is, though, I was already falling much deeper than I meant to. I regret even bringing the topic up, and the idea of not dating this guy anymore is eating a pit into my stomach. I've spent the whole day trying to hide tears behind my desk at work. Even though we mutually agreed that it was the right thing to do, I feel absolutely wretched. Even though he told me that he doesn't want to move out of the busiest part of the city for 10 years, even though he seems pretty committed to living in a townhouse or a downtown loft with no yard, I'm still mentally trying to find a compromise with him. I even picked out a couple houses (purely as examples) to show him the area I had in mind. I haven't told him any of that, because I'm afraid I'll sound like a possessive nutter-butter.   Up until this point, this has been the most communicative, least-possessive/codependent relationship I've ever been in. To say the least, I'm reluctant to see it go. I even wrote this long-ass letter a couple hours ago attempting to describe the nature of a compromise with him, which is CRAZY, because I've known this guy four months. But if in a hypothetical future situation, he'd be willing to meet me even 3/4 of the way, that'd be more than anyone else has ever done for me. I want us both to be happy. I think I could do 2 minutes outside of downtown with a yard with the right person, but I have no way to know this soon if that'd be him. I don't want to compromise my own well-being, but I also don't want to lose a good thing. I've also found it pretty much impossible to locate an intelligent, artsy guy who was enthusiastic about living in the country—to the point that I'm not even sure such a guy exists. I don't know whether to bring up any of this with him or to just let it go. Things were going so well! Any insight at all would be appreciated.
I thought it would be funny to hear how far the munchies have taken you.   I'll start:   I go to university away from my home town so whenever I visit my mom usually cooks me up a feast (which is a grand reason why I love her). Anyways, I gave my parents the heads up that I will be home by Friday evening but, having not seen them for awhile, thought I would surprise them by arriving a bit earlier than they anticipated.   It's Friday afternoon and I park my car, sneak up to the door, take the spare key and open the door hoping to surprise my fam but turns out they're not home. A little anticlimactic, nonetheless I proceed to make myself familiar with the home I oh so missed.   I head over to my basement room and find my mflb (Vaporizer in case you were wondering). I used to smoke dabs out of my mflb and when university came around i stuck to mostly weed, thus why I left my mflb back at home (walls were coated with wax, useless for weed). Feeling nostalgic I look through the tin and slowly begin craving to get a wee bit high. Now I'm back home and my momma aint no dealer so I'm dry as granny's vagina- this doesn't change the fact that I'm craving and you all know when a man wants his high he gets his high. I realize I can get high off the reclaim (basically the mflb walls that were coated with wax, once heated, would get me faded) and go to work.   At this point I'm feeling  solid [7] and the trip back has me hungry. I open the fridge and oh my god, nothing runs goosebumps through my body the same way as my initial awe of  the mountain load of food in my fridge.   Man, there was lasagna, chicken and rice, kebob, everything. I ate 50% of all the food that was there, easily could have fed 20 people. I did say my mom cooks me a shit ton of food when I go home but this was a little suspicious.   They come home and turns out momma had invited all the fam and friends over Friday night just cause I was coming home. Being the Momma she is, she decided to cook a feast. Momma was a little ticked we had to call it off and it sorta ruined the surprise I had in mind.
My first wife was such a bad human being. I didn't see it for the first two years. Partly because we lived with my parents and she was always on her best behavior when they were around. We started having problems about a year into our marriage. She was a stay at home wife and I worked my ass off. I was tired when I came home and crashed fairly early. However when I got home she wanted to go out and party. She would wait for me to go to sleep and them hit, scratch, or bite me. If she wasn't tired then NO ONE could sleep. I was really worried that one of these times when I was trying to get her off me that she would get hurt and call the cops. I never did because I didn't want her calling the cops on me. I would go to the local park when she did this and crash for a few hours in a swing whenever this happened. I needed some sleep before work. This went on for months. Anyways word got back to one of my bosses about me sleeping in the local park and he told me about a destructive relationship he was in and how at the end of the day you needed to do what was best for you. We got divorced. It was extremely messy. I'm remarried and so happy I left her.
About me:   7 years of WoW - 20ish toons over 30 - 10 85s.   SWTOR since closed beta - 3 50s and 7 others over 20.   Many many other MMOs.   Apparently people didn't enjoy my concise answer below so I'll expand here (WoW vs SWTOR):   PvE:   Questing  - The voice acting in SWTOR make the questing completely immersive and very engaging.  WoW has no voice acting, but has occasional cut scenes.  I would put WoW as a 6.5 (up from a 4 with the new stuff from cata) and SWTOR as an easy 9 (maybe 9.5).   Instances (Flashpoints)  - WoW is very polished in this regard.  The matchmaking features are very well done and let pretty much any player queue and within 30 mins play a dungeon with cross server players.  SWTOR does not have any matchmaking and suffers from the original issues of WoW from years ago.   Raids (Operations)  - Similar to the previous instances/flashpoints.   PvP:   Rated WZs/BGs  - The SWTOR 1.2 patch was supposed to include rated warzones, but they were yanked a few hours before patch time with reasons of "not yet ready".  WoW has polished them over the years, but the time to kill is still pretty low and lackluster IMHO.  SWTOR pre 1.2 had a great TTK and had very addictive PvP.  I feel that they broke a lot of it with the 1.2 patch and my interest waned.  (full BM with a couple war hero pieces - rank 76)   General:   UI -  WoW has macros and a heavily customizable UI via mods.  It can do almost anything you want.  Recently SWTOR implemented a customizable UI for 1.2, but it's still lacking in some regards.  SWTOR has no macros and no mods.   Load Times  - There are many load screens for SWTOR.  Each time you hit a planet/warzone/space station/flashpoint, you'll hit a load screen.  WoW will only do this when switching to a continent or instance.   Performance  - Somehow SWTOR was built on old architecture.  I don't have the direct link (you can find it if you search the  /r/swtor , but it lists the fact that it is still a 32 bit application and runs no where near the performance of a modern PC game.  WoW has it's own performance issues.  It's still based on old architecture and outdated technology.  While basic performance runs better than SWTOR, it has large load times due to the mods that need to be installed.  Unfortunately, the default UI for WoW is horrible (yet improving) and requires mods to make the game more effective.   Summary   Wow has definitely lost its appeal and has fallen behind in the times.  Each content patch/update is more of the same with minor upgrades - more carrots to chase the gear.   If you love lore and an active storyline, SWTOR will definitely provide a great outlet.  This is an awesome single player game, but I would treat it as that.  The flashpoints are worth doing to see how the story progresses, but pretty boring during replay and farm.   The PvP is addictive for SWTOR, but I feel 1.2 really destroyed a fun aspect of it and made it unbalanced to that I have stopped PvPing (along with no rated warzones - straw on the camels back).
Hi all,   I'm helping design a Fantasy Football App for an undisclosed major website for next year's season. I'm trying to get some feedback from Fantasy Pros such as yourselves. I've created a very fast, 10 question survey through Google Docs that will probably take > 1 minute to do. I'd really appreciate it if I could get all you guys and gals to complete the form. Plus you can see some pretty graphs at the end of what everyone's answers are! Thank you all so much in advance!   Google Survey Form:
Was in the middle of a game and got booted. Put me to the screen where you play locally. Can't connect back online.   Did multiple hard resets. Logged in and out. Restarted modem and router.  I always get the screen where it says "error black ops 3 servers are offline". Error .....A...B.............F.G-.-,-,-,-,   I even started the game and let it sit at the guy holding the guns. Usually the top right patch numbers appear. They never do. Been like this for over and hour and what nots.   Anyone else got this problem?
Now to begin, I have a gaming PC and I don't personally own a console, my brother and father do but not me. I built my own PC and the thing is a beast, however it's almost three times more expensive as a next-gen console.   BUT I fucking hate the PCMR snobs out there who fail to recognize the the XB1 & PS4 are great gaming options. They're incredibly cheap and for what you pay for aren't too shabby either. Yes, I understand that you can build a "gaming PC" for 350$ however you're gonna end up with mostly shit parts that you're gonna have to upgrade from in a few years, and don't even start with fucking APU's.   Consoles are an amazing option for someone who is looking to not spend a lot of money and play some really solid games. My little brother has an XB1 and has like 6 games for it but only plays one- Destiny. Also, consoles are great for many other reasons, they don't get shitty ports that take forever to be fixed, they are cheap, they're very easy to setup, they have great (sometimes) exclusives and so much more!   So take your head out of your fucking ass and realize that there are other ways to game.

Braun is a douchebag and a lying piece of shit, I prefer him to stay in Milwaukee and suffer many more dismal seasons for the duration of his career while buddy boy Selig jerks off in a corner.
Hear me out guys: Starfish Troopers. It's a little something like this:   "Your basic starfish warrior isn't too smart, but if you blow off one of it's legs, it's still 100% combat effective, because they grow back."   "I have always wanted to go to Zegema Beach,"  "Good luck, it's not there anymore."  Cuts too Zegema beach, as it is ravaged by the starfish horde. Starfish on the beach, in the resteraunts, in people's drinks...   WAR... Out of the moisture of Zegema comes sadness, then anger... "THE ONLY GOOD STARFISH IS A DEAD STARFISH!" In Geneva, the Federal Council convenes; "WE MUST MEET THE STARFISH WITH OUR VALOR, OUR BLOOD, INDEED WITH OUR VERY LIVES... TO ENSURE THAT HUMANS, NOT STARFISH! DOMINATE THIS GALAXY NOW, AND ALWAYS.   Sky Marshall Dickbag announces plans for an offensive against the ocean, source of the wave that "destroyed" Zegema   ZEGEMA:  1 1/2 DEAD IN 2 WEEKS, Enemy  Casualties: -8.  "Fleet Officials admit that they had severely underestimated the starfish capacity for defense, our most effective way of killing them is with flame throwers, but the starfish have developed a defense in which they immerse themselves in Dihydrogen Monoxide, making our weapons useless.   But victory is certain for the Mobile Infantry! With advanced tactics provided by our pals at Psy Ops, we meet the starfish at the shore!   Starfish washes on shore  "NUKE 'EM RICO!"  BOOOOOOOOOOM
so i'm a fish out of water here. i've played pc games at a very competitive level forever and i got a ps4 pretty much to play any good sony exclusives.   i use a very low sensitivity in cs:go 1.8 & 400dpi but playing with a controller for an fps game is just completely different so i can't translate that over.   sooo what sensitivity do the majority of the super pro mlg 360 noscopers use?   also i have an xbox 360 controller that i know i would have better aim with but is it supported on ps4? i have it plugged up and it's just blinkinggggg   thanks friends and i hope next generation of consoles has full native keyboard/mouse support & display port w/ 144hz support so we can join forces to have a giant super community and all make billions of dollars in esportz   <3
I need to rant.   FUCK hackers, seriously, fuck them, this is utter bullshit. My 10 day character died, and about an hour ago I found my first AS50 in a chopper crash.   I'm heading to Stary, no where near it though, when ALL of a sudden I hear a helicopter, think little of it, i was in a pine forest with a ghillie suit, so I hide in a tree quickly before the helicopter comes over the hill and into view. I'm practically invisible.   But what's this? the helicopter comes directly for me, I get up and run deeper into the forest when the helicopter gets lower and lower, a guy jumps out, starts shooting at me, bandage myself behind a rock I quickly jumped behind and take a shot, the guy dies.. But this wasn't apparently fair with his friends raging at me in chat. I quickly reload, eat some meat and try to take aim on the helicopter that was now pretty much knocking over trees, yet still flying. But before you know it, the dude I killed before spawns behind me and kills me.   and I die.
My situation is a little bit unique, I think. I'm 25. I have a B.S. in Natural Science with a focus in natural science education and biology. What this means is I have a not-quite BS in Biology (short maybe one class from what it would have been if I just wanted a straight up BS in Bio), but I also have some chem and physics (and a shit load of education classes) that a normal Bio major would not have taken.   I've spent the last 3.5 years as a high school science teacher. I have a ton of respect for the profession - I don't believe in that whole "those that can't do, teach" thing.... but I'm truly a learner and I'm finding that I'm not really intellectually fulfilled by teaching. I've worked my way up and am currently teaching 11th-12th grade IBDP Biology (which is essentially a freshman Bio course for non-majors (probably) that is taught in HS). It still doesn't really do much for me. Most people I work with are basically satisfied with what they know and what they do. They teach photosynthesis at a fundamental level, but they aren't really into learning the mechanics of it or asking the "why" questions and finding out the answers, because they don't need to in order to teach it.   I do. I want to learn more about this stuff (not specifically photosynthesis) and do REAL research and REAL science. The problem is that with my degree, on paper, I can't compete with someone who is fresh out of college with a Bio degree, so it would be difficult for me to get even a basic bench job in the industry somewhere.   So I want to go back to school, really learn a lot of stuff and find an area to really specialize and geek out in. My undergrad GPA is like a 3.4 or something, I mostly dicked around in college - but I'm a different person than I was my freshman year - I wish I had the intellectual drive that I have now back then (and grad school isn't college)...   I'm looking at MS and (because that's ultimately where I want to end up and most of them are paid for unlike master's programs) PhD programs.   The undergrad course requirements for some of the programs I'm looking at are vague, but I think I might need a couple of extra courses (1-3 probably) to full meet them (mainly biochemistry for a semester or two, depending on the program). I know some of the programs say you can be accepted and have to make those up in the first year, but regardless I have about $10,000 of inheritance I would have no problem spending to take some more undergrad classes to boost this area of my application.   I'm very confident I can study and do very well on the GRE and subject-specific GRE. I'm good at tests and really great at retaining the kind of knowledge that they require (I virtually aced my SATs, for example, although I know those are not the same as the GRE).   My undergrad GPA was, again, 3.2 or 3.4. Not excellent, but I could boost that and show that I take my studies more seriously by taking some of the above mentioned undergrad classes that I might be lacking before applying. I think that a good GRE score would help with this, as well as the GRE-subject test (say Bio) which is often optional but might look good if I did well and put it on an application.   The biggest fear I have is that most programs say they prefer or expect previous research experience. I don't have any of this and it wasn't really an option when I was an undergrad. I'm not sure how I would get it. I assume its possible that I could get some research experience in my make-up undergrad classes - but....? Is it common to get this kind of experience as an undergrad bio major? I have lab experience and wrote a few simple research papers - but surely they aren't just talking about that, are they?   Then there are the letters of rec - I have no idea who would write those other than co-workers/supervisors at my school. To be fair I am known as being pretty smart and really being the biggest science nerd in the department - I'm sure I could get several people to write about how I have a huge passion for science, research, etc... but I don't have contact with any undergrad profs or anything (although, again, maybe I could if I took those undergrad classes before applying...).   So, is it a good idea to take some more advanced undergrad/post-bac science classes to boost my GPA, show I can really thrive in the sciences, be able to meet a few professors who might write me letters, and possible seek out some research experience through those professors (I don't even know how I would go about doing this).   For reference, I'm in Colorado. I did my undergrad at CSU. I'm considering trying to get into a PhD program for the fall of 2013. It could very well be a nation-wide search. My fiance is finishing a MA in Clinical Counseling around that point and would be willing to move to most places for me to get a PhD - in fact, we want to move somewhere anyway...   I'm interested in microbiology, genetics, cell biology. I'd love to get into astrobiology/exobiology from one of/some of those perspectives. I understand that astrobiology isn't a field where you can get a PhD (although several schools offer it as a "certificate" for those in related fields). I'm really interested in studying Archaea / Bacteria extremophiles - which I think translates well into Astrobiology.   I'm also interested in virology and infectious disease.   Hopefully taking a few undergrad courses may help fine-tune my interests, if that is even necessary before applying to a PhD program (seems like it is).
You could probably skip all the books and be just fine. You will learn far more about making magic if you begin observing other people. How do they dress? What are their mannerisms? Explore their social function, their mundane rituals. Move beyond people, do this exercise with inanimate objects, places, anything and everything that you have the potential to observe with your undivided attention can be used as a component of your final occult formula.   When you feel it's time to perform a ritual or spell or whatever, compile the data from your observations and approach your core desire using all the different facets of the subject you observed. If you observed it well enough, you'll resultantly gain comprehension. The ways in which you can apply comprehension, even in its incomplete form, are endless and in time you'll realize all the different talking heads of occultism at large are simply trying to reach fulfillment through understanding.   What are you supposed to do once you make it possible for yourself to comprehend? Anything you want, really. A good starting place is to reconstruct your own image, so other people in the world searching for answers by looking to their fellow man rather than pretentious prattlings of dead old white dudes can use you as an example by which to enrich their lives.
NSFW I am a 16 year old Swedish guy who comes to Finland every summer, mostly because of all the relatives I have here. Everyone here talks a combo-language between Swedish and finish, therefor it's easy to understand.   So there is this girl who I played around with since I was a little boy. Last year we messed around and stayed in touch until this summer. Not that we had some kind of long distant-relationship, just talked.   So I came here about a week ago and we met up earlier tonight to swim.  It was kind of awkward at first but after a few moments we joked around as always.   A little hop into the future and we were at her place, talking shittalk. All of a sudden she starts talking about her boobs and what I think about them. I'm kinda stunned because it came out of nowhere.   says something like:  "Ehm, they are nice"   She laughs and takes of her shirt to reveal her bikini and tells me to take it off. So I gently remove it and starts to kiss her. My goal here isn't to write about the sex stuff, more about the tifu. But we have sex and then talks about deep stuff like super volcanos, pretty standard, and falls asleep.   So about 4 hours I got woken up by J and she drags me up and tell me to go hide in the closet. I was so tired so I didn't even question her and sat down and she closes the door. Half minute later someone steps in to the room talking finnish. Wouldn't you know, next thing I hear is some kisses and then they went out.   I waited maybe 5 minutes before I went out the backdoor leaving my shoes and shorts there.   So I came to conclusion that he is probably her boyfriend and she cheated on him with me. I am kinda mad for her not telling me and I got a msg from her saying: "we talk tomorrow"   It's 4 am atm and I really don't want to meet up with her tomorrow if she really did cheat on that dude.   And as I said, my shoes and swim-shorts are at her house.
I haven't used that particular product, but I think some of the liquid tank stabilization products (like Stability) can help assist, but I'd be surprised if there's anything that can fully establish all of the proper bacteria populations in 24 hours.   I recently decided to move my Betta to a new tank.  I bought sand that was supposedly precycled, added the cloth from his old filter cartridge to the new filter, used a layer of his current substrate as a foundation for the new substrate, and have been dosing like crazy with Stability and today I am reading Nitrites...  granted, it's only taken it 2 days which is a little quicker, but it's definitely not cycled.   Sorry, got a little off topic there :)  the
I had 3 cats disappear in late 2007. Bubba we think died from cat food that was recalled shortly after and Jake was never seen again. Tiger we also thought gone for good.   However about 2 and a half years later we get a call from a stranger asking if we were missing a cat. Initially I said no because they had been gone for so long I thought them dead. But then he asked if we ever had a cat named Tiger. We said yes and then he told us how he found her.   About 1.5 miles away on the other side of an overpass is a foster's freeze and apparently somehow she had made her way over there and had been living off of the scraps with a pack of feral cats. The guy who found her noticed one day that she was so fat that her collar was in danger of choking her. So he coaxed her over and looked at her tags and our number was on it.   So
Could you kindly point out a single instance of actual racism in this thread?   Indian outsource developers are horrible. It has nothing to do with their ethnicity (I know several great American programmers who are ethnically Indian), it's about the economics and culture that give rise to these Indian outsource shops. It isn't racist to make this observation, or to laugh at it a little.
I'd say it's not a rule, but things are getting weird fast. I'm 29 years old and used to consider people ±5 years from me 'my generation'. However, facebook made me cut the -5 portion away. So it's strange thinking that people who are 24 are another generation (yes, I realise I'm an oldfag now). Also, generation gaps were different  in the old days . I feel like a 60 year old. I hate the facebook generation with all the hatred I've got.
Putting aside all the obvious facts about why this couldn't happen, I have to point out, only around 7% of the gases that come out when you fart are flammable if I recall. The remaining amount is primarily nitrogen and oxygen. The burst would not likely ignite, and if it did, it wouldn't be hot enough, or over enough time to burn anything more than your eyebrows.
This is really a huge point about how our fanbase works compared to other teams.  This. is. not. a. hockey. town.  We've got to work our asses off to get the word out and build hype.  Most of our kids don't grow up playing hockey, let alone getting good at it.  We have no frozen ponds to play on let alone freezing temperatures.  We've got no Trojan or Bruin hockey to follow so anyone who does play has to go elsewhere.  Plus, we're competing against two of the oldest and most storied franchises in all of sports between the Lakers and Dodgers.  There's little attention paid and the culture generally doesn't care.  How do you even say hockey in Spanish?
Considering there's no logo merchandise and another user asked for it, I've edited the current logo to remove the background and just keep the logo and name.   Rather than just publically give out a link for it, I'd rather you PM me if you'd like a copy of the file. Just a precaution I'd like to take with it.   A sample image of it on a t-shirt can be found  here .
How about you read what you quote before using it to corroborate your impotent, misguided opinion?   Besides the fact that paper is ten years old, and the studies it quotes go back to the mid eighties, it says a sedentary lifestyle will cause more cases of ED by a long shot, and cycling (or any other kind of exercise) is likely to fix it.
It's not biker UNfriendly here, but most people are not expecting you on anything but residential streets or city streets.  Unless you are going to stay right next to your area of intrest/employment you will probably have to use a car on the interstate/highway system.  Also, as a biker i'm sure you know, and i'll assume you are a responsible biker, but please obey the traffic laws and use your hand signals.  Most of the people here won't know why you are sticking your hand out straight to the left, but they will atleast see you are there and notice that person on the bike sticking their left hand out. Also, four way stops and 'roundabouts'... assume everyone stopping at them has no clue how to use them. They are bigger than you, and half of our drivers here are the slow sothern types, the other half are road rage types.  Also don't expect them to ever signal with their blinkers.  People down here simply can't drive.  You take your life in your hands riding on any road that's 35MPH or above.  most of the time there's no shoulder or bike lane.  Just words of advice from a bike rider, annoyed driver from the area.
After some googling...   There doesn't appear to be an "official" store but rather there are "pop-up stands" that exist when needed.   Ex:  [Shinjuku store] ( that opened in August 2010 to promote the first Naruto Shippuden film.   [JUMP Stores] ( are common around Japan, especially near major cities.  One such store was opened in Osaka in 2012 but that mainly sold all things Shonen Jump related, NOT just solely Naruto stuff.  Here's another [link] ( on aShonen Jump shop near Tokyo station.
We have sort of the opposite thing going on: I'm switch but more bottom, and she's vanilla but open. She wants to top me out of love for me, because I have a strong desire for it, but she's more of a service top than anything. At first, she was very hesitant to do anything that was painful, because she didn't want to hurt someone she loved. Now, as we have played more and COMMUNICATED more(holy shit communication is EVERYTHING in a healthy relationship), she is coming to play sessions with more of an attitude of "it's just playtime, and this is fun". She knows that I'll stop her if it's too much. She is still hesitant, but she's getting better.
I really need some advice. I've been rummaging through my brain for so long but I can't seem to come up with anything new. Please give me your two cents.   I've been diagnosed with BPD a few years ago, as well as major depressive disorder with recurring episodes between every few weeks, up to months at most. I will experience at least 3 or 4 episodes per year, they range from mild to severe.   I am so tired. I'm in my 20s, but I feel like I'm a million years old. This started when I was 10-ish, 11, not sure, although I was always a gloomy child. I was also abused physically and mentally by my family. Now, I'm a fairly smart person, but my parents discouraged any sort of hobby and activity. We lived on an island, about 5km away from the "town". What this means for me today is that I am  incredibly  asocial. I literally have no friends. I also don't really.... do anything? I have interests but I never managed to develop any sort of habit. ANY sort of habit. I have no idea how to do that. At this point I have almost zero motivation. I feel like a sack of pebbles thrown into a lake.   Somehow, I managed to meet this amazing person that even more amazingly ended up marrying me. We love each other greatly. I have no doubts about whether we belong together- but... just... do we have a future together? We're both down to earth people and I gotta say have pretty realistic goals. Nothing too extreme. I want to go back to school, he has a good career lined up, we want to start a family at some point in the future. IF I manage to get out of the depression cycle. I don't want to ruin his life.   My BDP I can deal with. I practice mindfulness, I keep an eye on myself. I manage well. We communicate well. We don't fight, not really. We occassionaly argue about socks on the floor, you know? But not the depression, not anymore, I can't deal with that. It gets so extreme that I will have to use every morsel of energy I have to keep myself from suicide. I'm currently on a waiting list for therapy, again, will probably get an appointment in about a month. But I've been to all kinds of therapy already, some helped, some didn't, at this point I feel like I need a life coach, not a therapist.   He needs me. He wants to do exciting things with me. I do too! But sometimes I can't help him or myself or do anything. I try to establish a healthy rhythm of living but I just can't keep it up. I end up just not doing anything. I don't do anything BAD, I don't have any bad habits- I don't have any sort of habits! Sometimes I resort to just sitting on the sofa waiting for him to get back from work. I do WANT TO do some things but I just don't really... I don't really know. So many things I cleared up in my head - the bdp, the abuse, our relationship, communication... Not this. And I am left with this:   -Because I spent the majority of my life depressed, I don't know how to behave not-depressed   -I have many interests, most really worth pursuing, but can't manage to keep up a habit   -My level of physical activity is really low, and I have trouble motivating myself. This gets more difficult with every depressive episode as I become even less able - fit - active   -I have no friends. I have little interest to make some, but I am quite lonely.   -My asocial behaviour has made me socially anxious and I can't bring myself to find a job. I've never had a real job, there's nothing on my CV, we're also pretty much struggling with money   Right now I am just feeling lucky to have gotten out of the latest episode. I'm at a point where I am capable of doing  something  differently.   But what the fuck do I do?   Thank you so much if you read this all. I am eternally grateful for any sort of advice.
Great idea, if you like living in caves without electricity. Because that's where your headed. Link explains why.
We began with a simple balloon. Nothing to special, nothing too fancy, but it was glorious for the people of the Stone Age. As ages passed, so did the idea of just one balloon. People realised that the balloon was lonely, and to make it better they produced three balloons in a straight line. No one attempted this before, and so crowds flocked to see this discovery. Then everyone realised just how great the balloon is.   Suddenly, the balloon evolved rapidly. Huge walls of balloons where being formed, bigger and bigger by the day. One man made a whole writing system based on balloons, and naturally that was a craze when it was released. Balloon merchandise was available at every street, nay, at every  house . One old guy even flew off to a mystical land by tying masses of balloons to his house! Truly the technology of balloons have come a long way. We have always wanted bigger. Better. Stronger.   But now we must create something incredible, something that will be remembered forever. The world will be shook by this new discovery. Our scientists have discovered that we can make a balloon to rival even the Lennypede! Yes, we shall create the  BIGGEST BALLOON EVER WITNESSED BY MANKIND!
Guys, let's have some serious discussion here.   First of all, I'm not sure why the title says it's funny, cause I find this review more disappointing than anything.   Second, I'm getting the game as an X-Mas gift, so unfortunately, I have a couple months to wait before I can see for myself who's right about it.   But moving on, this seems to happen everytime IGN releases a review for a big game; people will hate them for opinions that are different than their own, which is why critics are reviewing games so highly nowadays. People complain all the time how critics don't use the scale X/10 properly, but frankly, they're forced into it. They need to rate games as highly as they can possibly justify to keep fans happy, occasionally throwing in a low review like this to establish some form of "credibility."   Take Skyrim, for example; the hype for that game was so high that, no matter how it turned out, there was no way in hell that any mainstream review sites would be allowed to raise any major criticisms. In the few weeks and months after it came out, everyone rode the wave of hype, talking about how amazing and beautiful it was. Give it a few more months, and I see tons of complaints all over about how repetitive the mission structure is compared to Oblivion. I'm not saying these complaints are false, but it shouldn't take several months for people to take notice and say something, or to even  feel  safe saying something.   Criticism of both games and reviews is becoming incredibly rampant on the internet, but praise is the same way. No one seems interested in exploring and understanding games anymore; it's all about forming your own opinion and then coming up with arguments later on to back it up.   I'm not saying the review is right or wrong, but for us to simply criticize them for having an opinion (cause that's really all a review is; an opinion, although it's arguably considered a  better  opinion than the average consumer) is not helping the situation. Simply disliking the video review on YouTube and posting hateful comments about how "full of shit" IGN and other sites are is simply causing more hatred and anger as people turn gaming into a competition over who plays the best games, which is stupid. We're all gamers here, with a passion to play and discuss video-games. I actually enjoy talking with friends who have different opinion from me with what games are good and bad, because those are the people who challenge my thinking and expose me to new ideas.   And no matter what you say, I doubt IGN really cares; they're still getting payed to play video-games, and you caring what they think is only empowering them. Form your own opinions, cause yours can be just as valid as theirs if you work to establish credibility. Hating on them right now is just you trying to justify your purchase to yourself to protect your own egos. Sorry to break it to you, but IGN doesn't actually give a shit what you think, regardless of what their opinions of particular games are.   So to summarize all this, don't start a circlejerk about hyping or hating games; instead, try and learn and understand it's underlying principles and what characteristics make it unique, for better or for worse.
I've been at this for about 18 months and have had absolute insanity regarding Aunt Flo. I'm on BC to help regulate, but to no avail.   What I've learned is that your body needs calories/energy to do its thing and I've been at such a huge deficit most weeks that I'll have symptoms but no flow. Or if I have a cheat day that will sometimes kick things off.   I talked to my OBGYN and she said that working out so much and eating so little will continue to mess things up, but that it doesn't cause any damage to your body to go without for a few months.
Why are you opposed to a new windows/generic machine? IMO, as a CM major who does a fair amount of coding, I enjoy my Macbook Pro, and I don't really see the point of a Chromebook. The only problem I've run into with my computer is that I can't play Alice: The Madness Returns on my Windows partition due to firewalls not playing nice with the different operating systems.
So we are talking about support here; one of the most unpopular roles in the game. Even though season 4 changed supports and made them a more 'fun' role to play I believe you can split supports into 2 groups:   People who play support regularly.   people who were basicly forced into the role.   Now I ask you this, for both scenario's. Who are you to decide how the botlane will be fought? Most support mains know the matchups they are fighting. If they play a sona, a lane that doesn't really all-in, they still will want to poke. And now you get matched up with an adc who provides 0 pressure in lane, relinquishes brush control and runs away when you get all inned by that leona because he believes he can't win so it's best to just let you die. That is very frustrating.   Same with someone who is forced into the role, they probably have little experience in the support role, yet they get paired with an adc that doesn't back any of their decisions. It's better if both people go in on a bad call, then if only one person does and he basicly provides free snowball gold for the lane.   Now I totally agree with you that you shouldn't flame in game, ever. It lowers moral and it's not going to help you win the game. But please get of your adc high-horse, the botlane is a duo lane where both parties hvae to adapt to each others playstyle and sure this is also on the support, he should adapt as well. The way you put it in your post however, makes it seems you are unable to play any other way then the farm way, unable to play in sync with your botlane partner. If you don't know how to play with a variety of supports atleast communicate that in champion select, or just don't play the role at all.   Once again I want to underline that I don't condone flaming, in fact you can tell your botlane is going to be shit when you're paired with a flamer. Because you can usually tell someone is bad at working in a team when they flame and the botlane is all about team work.
Link to original:   Something I failed to mention during my original post is that I work graveyard shifts and the cooking was going to be done during the slow time.  I decided last night when I woke up around seven and reading all of your comments (thank you buy the way!) that I was going to try to make ice cream. But after spending several hours driving around my neighboring towns, I failed to locate any liquid nitrogen or dry ice. So twenty five before work, I went to Walmart and purchased all the ingredients to make these,   when I got to work, I had one of the biggest coincidences of my life. Somehow, a hot plate was left in the break room supposedly by an old co-worker of mine who just recently left. Apparently, she used to cook breakfast on this burner at work in the morning. So when work slowed down, and I started the prep work for these cookies, I realized I didn't have a pan! So I had to make a pan out of aluminum foil and bring a lot of the ingredients to a boil in a makeshift piece of aluminum foil. The aluminum ended up melting onto the burner and almost ruining the burner I was using so I had to drive back to Walmart on my lunch break and ended up buying a pan, a potato masher for the banana, and little cups for the presentation. So I made a batch with my makeshift pan and a larger batch with the real pan. Great, right? Well, turns out the hot plate belonged to a daily customer of ours and she was letting a co worker borrow it for a couple weeks. So the co- worker came in right after I finished the last batch of cookies and took the hot plate that I was relying on to use for my presentation that was in two hours. So after spending more money than I should have and quite a bit of time on these cookies, everything basically became useless.   Fast forward two hours to my presentation, I decided to just tell my class and teacher everything that happened just several hours ago, including pictures of my project, the cookies I made, and the how I managed to lose a magic hot plate that appeared at my work.   After telling a few lies about the ingredients I used and the health benefits of these cookies, I managed to lengthen my presentation to the required time and getting a, "For what happened, your presentation turned out quite good."   Thank you everyone for all the suggestions! I will now be a subscriber to, r/cooking!!
Edit: This girl E flirts with everyone equally, myself included.   I've been with my boyfriend for 6 happy years. We're so in love and want to spend the rest of our lives together. But recently we hit a pretty big speed bump.   My boyfriend and I were at a friend's party a couple weekends ago. My friend (let's call her E) has known both of us for about 7 years now and is one of my best friends.   A couple hours in, I was talking to a group of people and noticed my boyfriend and E with their arms around each other's waists talking to another group. I felt a sting of jealousy, since in the past my boyfriend has hit on E a couple of times right in front of me. But I shrugged it off, figuring I should just trust and they were with a group anyway.   I was pretty drunk a few hours in. I get emotional when I reach a certain level of drunk, so I went to my friend's room for some quiet time since I could feel the emotions kicking in. Some time went by (not sure how much) and my friend H came in to console me. Some more time went by, and my boyfriend came in and told me he'd just kissed E.   The next part is a bit hazy, but I was very angry and yelled a lot. I even managed to punch him in the jaw. E came in and told me that it was just a peck and meant nothing. I was angry and I know I said some hurtful things to her. My boyfriend got us a cab and we went home.   My boyfriend and I talked the next day. He said he was so sorry and felt guilty, and said he hated himself for hurting me. I told him I had heard it all the last couple of times he hit on E, and that I wasn't sure I could trust him anymore.   We both really want to be together and we're working things out.   My dilemma: I love my boyfriend with everything I've got, and I know he loves me just as much. But he has a problem controlling himself with E, having hit on her twice (that I know of) and kissed her. I think it's really important that he told me right away, but I can't stop picturing him kissing her. I need your help, Reddit. How can I trust my boyfriend again? Or am I just stupid for trying?   Edit: This girl E flirts with everyone equally, myself included.
I'm actually (supposed to be) writing a paper on this. It's called compulsory voting. Obviously it is a very heavily opinionated subject and there are a lot of angles to the issue, but here's my take on it:   Voter turnout isn't the issue. Obviously instituting such a system would increase turnout. I believe the main issue is the votes distorting the election.   There is a small percentage of the population who does not like any of the candidates. These people stay home for that reason and that reason only. However, there is a much larger percentage of the population that does not vote because they are lazy, uneducated, too busy, etc.   Now suppose all those people are forced to show up and cast their vote. There would be the choice to submit a blank ballot, but evidence shows a very small number of people would actually submit a blank ballot. Instead, they figure "Fuck, if I'm here, I might as well vote for somebody." This can lead to impulsive decision making by many voters. The impulse could come from a short political ad on tv, from a news headline, or any variety of places. The point is, they are making an uneducated decision because they are more or less forced to.   No one will ever be able gather evidence to conclude whether or not these claims are actually true. As I previously mentioned, there are a number of angles to this issue. The major political parties are in favor of such a mandate, which should be enough to deter you. This means they can spend less money mobilizing voters and more money on advertizing.   Anyways, I'm tired and don't feel like writing more.
PREAMBLE (Introduction):   I met this girl 4 months ago and she had a boyfriend of a few years.  I had no intention of being in ANY sort of relationship and often turned down any advances from the opposite sex--I just wasn't interested.  She, with her situation, was the same way.   This is where the story changes, however.  Her and I were drawn to each other.  We found ourselves getting closer and closer to each other.  Both of us were trying to stop ourselves and convince ourselves that this infatuation.  We both worked very hard to not get interested in each other, but it didn't help.  We fell amazingly in love with each other despite our efforts to stop that from happening (and believe me, we tried very very hard to avoid it).  We didn't do anything, but just being near each other filled us with joy.   They say that love hits you when you least want it to and when it does you become powerless to its pull.   I know this sounds all "rainbows and butterflies" and you think this is the kind of stuff most people say when they first meet someone, but that's because you don't know me:  In all my relationships I've been in up to today, I have never once truly loved any of my ex-gfs.  I cared for them, sure, but it wasn't love.  So much so that I've only ever said "I love you" literally 2 times before meeting her (not even to parents), because I always want to reserve those words for someone I truly loved with all my heart.   That said, I had to admit that I loved her and foolishly gathered all the courage I could muster and admitted it to her.  Despite her relationship, I felt it was unfair to not let her know.  Much to my surprise, she admitted to feeling the same way.  Feeling like every moment away draws you together more, like a reverse magnetic field, with the inner center being commanded by the strong force that binds protons.   During the time we knew each other, it became apparent to me that her current boyfriend was emotionally neglecting and didn't care much for her feelings at all.  He cared more about his own personal life, goals, and convenience then paying attention to her needs.  This had been eating her alive for a while.  After talking to her friend and I, she realized the relationship she was in wasn't for her.  She promised me she'd break up with him.   The problem is, he lives with her and it doesn't look like he is going to move out.  So, she has been staying at her friend's house in the mean while.   MAIN CONCERN:   I think she has broken up with him, but I don't really know.  We decided we are going to give her some time to get over him and then her and I will try our relationship when her heart is un-burdened by memories of him.   My problem is if I ask her about their status or if I even mention him it upsets her and she gets very defensive sometimes.  She also is requesting some "space" from me while she gets over things.  Normally I wouldn't worry, but plenty of times in she had said she was going to break up with him and then ends up not going through with it.  Always making excuses that it wasn't his fault he was the way he was.   She also continues to talk to him.  I want to give her space and respect her boundaries but I worry that she will end up getting back together with him if she keeps talking with him.  I also worry about why she needs this "space" from me and why she seems like she really enjoys herself when she's with me, but then tries to avoid me sometimes.   Am I being unreasonable for not wanting her to talk to her "ex"?   Should I be worried about the space she has been asking for?  If not, how long should I allow her space and how much?   Thanks, please be polite. I really, truly love her and I want to do this right for her.
DAI was free a few months ago for a weekend and I played it then and it was always in my "ready to install" page but whenever I installed it and tried to play I still only had a few hours left from the 10 hour trial. I started it up today and didn't get the notification.
I've not seen this one brought up yet, so I will give it an honorable mention:   For when you want the body buzz from mushrooms, and the unpredictable visuals of acid all built into one chemical - try mescaline. In about 1-2 hours you will morph from an angry person cursing the dealer who burned you on bad drugs, to a zen master who is not only in touch with, but is literally carried by the various waves of reality. Soon you will go on an adventure. It doesn't matter what your physical body does, because your consciousness will wander with or without your meat-vessel. I found myself trekking through a wooded area in a small urban area when I stumbled upon the real world location of Dagobah, but sadly never found Yoda. I left the swamps and took a fistful of Vicoden (I was still recovering from a recent thoracic surgery) and within approximately 30 earth minutes/10 mescaline seconds, my memory starts to fade out completely. I remember standing on a bridge looking down into a dried creek bed ≈40ft down and watching the fabric of reality bend and wave rhythmically, stumbling across a caterpillar that was roughly 6 earth inches/25 mescaline feet long and panicking and fearing for my life, and following a laser pointer in the dark because it was going to be the only thing that led me back home, since I chose to be on foot for every moment of this roughly 11 hour adventure. Once I get home I, within minutes of walking in the front door, start a fight with my TV for grimacely scowling at me and mocking my state of mind, then start a fight with my (ex)girlfriend because she took sides with the TV, making excuses like "it's an inanimate object" and "you're on drugs" and other bullshit excuses to justify the secret affair those two were having together behind my back. I knew, I could see it in their faces. I left the house and slept at a children's park on a park bench. I woke up the next morning covered in bug bites, dirty as hell, smelling even worse, and generally confused as to what memories were real, and those that were fabricated by my substance enhanced mind. I went back home and greeted by the "we need to talk" line by the girl I was soon to no longer be dating...   Fucking mescaline. Created by the gods, so that men may become gods. At the price of their sanity.
Gamestop employee here to clear up the confusion...   Fire Emblem Awakening has had its release date officially lifted, so all Gamestops are able to sell them.   However while the computer system says that we are allowed to, some managers want to wait for an email from their district managers confirming the availability.   So depending on the manager, or if the employee who was spoken to just didnt check, everyone shouldve been told that the game was ready to be sold upon shipment.   And ever store should have them in by Thursday at the latest
My girlfriend and I have been dating for about six months. About a month ago I asked her to move in with me, and she did.   Her daughter, we'll call her "A", has always liked me a lot. That is, until they moved in. When they first moved in, she was fairly happy and it was all business as usual, but recently she's been overly "needy", I'd call it.   For example, I do all of the cooking in our house. So, after I finish cooking, I normally set the table for A and my girlfriend. This was fine when she first moved in, but in the past week or so, she's screamed like she was on fire until her mom picks up the plate, and then sets it back down in front of her.   She's also made it overly clear that I'm "not allowed" to sit next to her mom, or kiss or, or put my arm around her.   Also, when girlfriend is asleep but A and I are awake, she'll say "Hey, where's mom?". When I tell her that she's asleep, she starts screaming, I'm assuming, to wake her up.   Strangely enough, when A and I go to the store and leave her mom at home, A is fine, and we normally have a good time. It seems to me like she's cool with me until her mom is around.   Another thing: When all 3 of us are out in town and I go to get her out of her car seat, she yells "momma help me!"   I know that she's 3, and that she has no concept of what appreciation is, but since I am the sole provider for all 3 of us, it would be nice if she appreciated me, at least a little bit. Girlfriend tells me every day that one day she'll appreciate me, but right now I feel like I'm running ragged. I do a lot to make the little girl like me, but I'm at the end of my rope, nearly.
Okay, you've got a point there.   So at least for phone usage, Oracle should not try to bring Java ME there again. For resource constrained embedded devices, Java ME might have some rights to exist, although not in its current form. The JavaOne news was that Java ME as a separate Java Language specification will be phased out. It will be the same as Java SE, but with respect to the library just a smaller subset of it. This will be rather easy with the modularity stuff.
First of all, let me say this: I’m not a scientist, nor do I pretend to be.  These are just observations I’ve had mixed with some shit I’ve read.  So if you want to win self-righteous points by pointing out scientific flaws, go fuck yourself.   I’ve always been a pretty confident, upbeat person so I never understood why some people had problems with self-esteem.  I would always offer banal, unhelpful advice like “fake it till you make it man!” or “just think you’re awesome.”  However, I’ve recently learned that low self-esteem is a mental disease that begins with strong emotions elicited by natural biological reactions, stemming from evolution.  Let me explain.   Ranking  Human beings, like a lot of other apes, are naturally hierarchical creatures – so much so, that we rank each other.  In a human “tribe,” each person has a rank – there is a #1, a #2, a #3, etc… This ranking system is biologically wired into our emotions by evolution, whether we like it or not.  Scientists studying bonobos (one of our closest ape cousins) came up with a device that could mimic a bonobo voice.  They realized that if they emitted a sound equivalent to the #7 ranked bonobo sounding disrespectful to the #6 ranked bonobo, not only would the #6 bonobo get angry and upset, EVERYBODY IN THE TRIBE would get angry and upset.  In other words, bonobos (and probably humans) are wired to organize ourselves into a very specific hierarchy and then have everybody respect that hierarchy.  This makes sense – if you look at most human societies, companies, and social groups, they are clearly organized into hierarchies, with an alpha male at the top, a #2 beneath him, etc… And the reason these hierarchies work is that everybody generally accepts the order.   But what does it mean to be “ranked” higher?  It works like this: the #1 ape gets to do whatever the fuck he wants.  He fucks whoever he wants, eats whatever he wants, and goes wherever he wants.  Scientists have observed chimps moving out of the way when the #1 ape walks by. Chimps even bow to the alpha male.  Naturally, the #1 ape (the alpha male) gets to be #1 because he is the strongest and most powerful ape in the group.  Then, the #2 ape also gets to do whatever HE wants, subject to deferring to #1.  And so on.  As you go down the ranks, the apes get less freedom to do what they want because they have more people they have to take orders from.  From an evolutionary perspective, this arrangement makes sense: the tribe is more likely to survive and be healthy if there was a “leader” who gave orders to his underlings, rather than if every ape just did whatever they wanted to.  This is why many companies are organized hierarchically.  This arrangement has the added advantage of ensuring that the strongest and healthiest apes eat the most and reproduce.   The #1 ape doesn’t really care about the other apes because he is stronger than them and can do whatever he wants.  But the cohesion of the tribe depends on the lower ranked apes obeying the higher ranked apes so the lower-ranked apes evolved to form a deep emotional attachment to higher ranked apes and constantly obsess over how to please them.  What does the alpha male want?  What is he thinking? Am I upsetting him? This makes sense too – if the lower ranked apes didn’t give a fuck about the alpha male, they would try to eat the same banana the alpha male was trying to eat and the alpha male would knock them the fuck out.  Lower-ranked apes are also wired to bow and act submissive around higher-ranked apes.  For this reason, the lower-ranked apes are full of stress and anxiety because they don’t want to fuck up and piss off the higher-ranked ape.  In fact, scientists have theorized that social anxiety comes about because lower-ranked individuals don’t want to talk to or even be around higher-ranked individuals out of fear they will make them upset and get their ass beat.   The fact that the lower apes obsess about the higher apes and the higher apes don’t give a fuck about the lower ranked apes has caused a lot of stress and misery in human affairs.  It is the reason slavery, poverty, inequality and abuse exist.  Religion had to force higher-ranked people to care about lower-ranked people because we don’t naturally have those emotions.  Sure, we feel a mild bit of compassion, like when you see a homeless guy, but those emotions are not strong enough to make you actually treat poor people well.  This is why rich white people lose their minds if a rich white girl goes missing, but don’t care if the same thing happens to a poor black girl.   The worst part of the not caring thing is that in relationships one party is “inferior” and obsesses over the other party, while the “superior” party feels nothing.  That’s why some people are shocked when they get dumped – they had intense feelings for their partner, and they don’t understand how their partner could feel NOTHING for them and walk away with the relationship like nothing happened.   Not only do human beings respect the hierarchy, we feel good when we are in what we perceive to be our rank.  If you put a person at a rank they don’t feel they belong in, they feel anxiety (remember the bonobos freaking out).  If you took a janitor and made him a CEO he would feel a ton of anxiety and would want to go back to being a janitor, even though he logically knows being a CEO is a better job.  If you’ve ever had a depressed friend, you might have noticed that they insist they suck (i.e, they are ranked at the bottom of the tribe) even if they aren’t – they are purposely trying to put themselves at the bottom because that is where they emotionally feel like they fit.  If it weren’t for people accepting (and liking!) their position, the hierarchy wouldn’t work.   But if we are born equal how are rankings established?  I’m not exactly sure how, but I think it goes like this: we meet somebody that is in our peer group (aka the tribe).  We size them up and try to determine how “powerful” they are.  Powerful means different things in different contexts and communities, but it could mean rich, attractive, strong, etc… Then, depending on how they act (and how we act) and if we feel like they are more powerful than us, a powerful biological reaction occurs in our brain where we see ourselves as being “beneath” them and them as being ranked higher than us (or vice-versa).  Sometimes, the word “powerful” doesn’t even make any sense – nobody is “powerful” in middle school, but there is always a “cool kid” that had a sidekick and then a bunch of losers that followed him around everywhere and did everything he told them to.  Of course, this interaction and reaction only occurs with people we emotionally care about – we don’t rake ourselves against the guy at the bank or people in the highway, but we do rank ourselves against our friends, people at our graduation party, people we date, etc…  The problem is that once we’ve spent enough time “beneath” somebody that emotion solidifies and we see ourselves as beneath them forever – no matter if they become homeless and we become a CEO.   Rejection anxiety  If a person gets rejected from the tribe completely, they feel rejection anxiety.  Because our biological processes think we are in the woods alone, we lose our appetite (to conserve food), can’t sleep (you shouldn’t sleep when you are in the woods alone and the tribe won’t protect you from predators), we feel terribly alone, and we constantly ruminate on what he did to get rejected, so we can fix it and so the tribe takes us back.  Rejection anxiety is one of the worst feelings a human being can experience, and it make sense – evolution has designed us to not do anything that would get us rejected from the tribe, and for us to feel terrible if we do.   Now we can understand low self-esteem.  A person gets low self-esteem when they enter into an emotional relationship with a person they see as “above” them and that person treats them like shit.  The parties subconsciously “agree” that one person is beneath the other.  Their body and mind undergo a biological process where they now believe themselves to be a low-ranking individual dependent on the higher-ranking person, even if logically they are not.  In my life I am seen some incredibly attractive, smart, successful people with low self-esteem.  It’s not a conscious “decision,” but a biological process that produces overwhelming feelings of inferiority that are hard to eradicate.   The low self-esteem person forms an emotional attachment to the higher-ranked person and subconsciously feels it is their duty to please them.  Human beings do a thing called confabulation, which is where their brain justifies their emotions, so their thoughts rationalize their behavior. People stay in abusive relationships because they subconsciously feel low-ranking and confabulate reasons why they deserve the abuse. Their emotions and thoughts team up to create a toxic reality for them.  They are afraid to leave because then they will lose their rank, or, worse, be rejected from the tribe altogether.  And of course, the relationship offers them a lot of good feelings as well so they learn to ignore the abuse.   A few bugs of human psychology exacerbate this problem.  Our biology can’t differentiate between one person rejecting us and the entire tribe rejecting us (apes didn’t have monogamy) so when we get dumped we feel like the entire tribe rejected us and we are in the woods alone.  This is why a person with one-itis thinks crazy things like “I will never find another girl like her” or “I will never be happy again” or “the world hates me.” Worse, our biology doesn’t know there are multiple tribes in the world.  Logically, if a person gets dumped or treated like shit, they should just move on and find somebody else who doesn’t do that to them.  But because our biology thinks the entire world is just one tribe, if a person treats us like shit we think we have been permanently relegated to a lower rank and the only way to regain that rank is for the abuser to accept us again.  And oftentimes, the abuser will happily pretend to accept us (to feed his or her own ego) and then treat us like shit again at some point.  This is why it is so difficult to fix low self-esteem. Even if P moves to a new city and finds a new group of friends who see him as high-ranking, he still thinks the world is one tribe and will still feel low self-esteem until his high school bully approves of him even if P is a rich lawyer and his high school bully works at McDonalds.  Having low self-esteem makes people emotionally unstable and shitty to others.  They are wracked with depression and anxiety that paralyzes them so they don’t do anything that might offend their superiors.  This prevents them not only from interacting with people in a healthy way, but also from achieving their goals, being productive, etc… Furthermore, everybody wants to have a higher rank – so when low self-esteem people meet somebody who isn’t “ranked” in their world, they have a strong desire to step on them to make up for the inferiority they feel with others.  On one hand, they want to be highly-ranked but on the other hand they feel extreme anxiety if they leave their lower, shitty rank.  These conflicting emotions produce crazy behavior.  You may notice that women with low self-esteem will act submissive for long periods and then suddenly do something shitty to assert her “dominance” over you.   Happy, spiritually enlightened people don’t play the “rank” game.  They resist their ape-like urges (it’s difficult) to make themselves “better” or “worse” than others, and they just treat everybody equally, with respect and dignity. They realize their true value comes from their character and accomplishments, not from other people’s approval. They take legitimate criticism from others, but don’t become affected emotionally. If somebody disrespects them, they don’t fight to get their rank back; they just cut them off.  If a person sees themselves as “higher” than you, nothing you can do can change their mind – they will fight you tooth and nail to keep their rank.  Because healthy people are not haunted by feelings of inferiority or superiority, they can assert themselves in relationships logically.   Withdrawing from the ranking game makes one an alpha. Remember, the “alpha” male, by definition, does whatever he wants and is intimidated by nobody, so if a person refuses to let his actions be constrained by others he will look alpha.  People gravitate towards the un-ranked person because he isn’t trying to push anybody beneath him. Paradoxically, if somebody refuses to play the ranking game, they win.   It is extremely important to draw strict boundaries in relationships. People are like kids.  If you let them act shitty they will act shitty and not even realize what they are doing.  When people act rude and fuck with you, they will slowly cause a shift in both of your minds that 1) they are above you and 2) you deserve to be treated like shit.  A lot of guys take crap from girls “because she’s hot, bro.”  Fuck that. You may think disrespect from a girl isn’t affecting you, but it is – it is slowly fucking with your biology and wrecking your self-esteem, subconsciously making you drop in rank.   So how can we prevent low self-esteem?   1-    Assert yourself in every relationship – like I said, don’t let yourself fall “beneath” anybody.  If somebody is being a dick, call them out on being a dick.  Don’t let people push you around.  Use your logical thinking ability rather than your “feelings” to determine if behavior is appropriate.   2-    Stop trying to please people.  Remember, girls (and guys) are attracted to the alpha male, aka the #1 ranked guy in the tribe. As we have stated, the definition of the alpha male is that he does whatever he wants.  So if you do whatever you want (within legal and moral boundaries) people will respect you.  It’s going to feel weird at first, especially if you’ve been trained your entire life to supplicate to people and make them happy, but once you start not giving a fuck what other people want, you will realize that people respect and like you more.  You need to continue to be polite and to take people’s emotions into account, just don’t constrain your actions based on them.   3-    Guard your self-esteem.  Now you know that self-esteem is a fragile, biological state of mind, guard it.  Let’s say you approach a woman at a club and she rudely rejects you – your self esteem will take a hit because a person who you were mildly emotionally invested in told you to fuck off.  It’s obviously an irrational emotional reaction, but you need to keep that in mind so that it doesn’t affect you.  Keep this in mind.
Fuck the "Who Dat Nation." Taking pride in having no education.
I will try very hard to not make this a brick of text.  We're both in our 30s and married for 9 years.   My husband has big issues with insecurity, and it comes out as condescension / irritation / dissatisfaction with me, or specifically most given tasks I’m trying to perform.  It’s not (I’ve done my google searching, it matches none of the classic red flags) over things like going out with friends, spending money independently, having other male friends, etc.  We share plenty of similar interests, can talk openly with each other, until it comes to something that puts his actions in a negative light OR concerns how I do something he might do differently. I’m running short of ideas on how to deal with my run-down patience with him when I find myself on the defensive.  I teach students; I have a calm demeanor and am naturally patient with others.  Where I might be pointing at an object I need handed to me, let’s say, if the first try doesn’t work I’ll respond “Nope, the other one – just to the right -  there , that one, thanks”, whereas he’ll insert a comment (out of genuine frustration) that if I were “just looking with my eyes in the direction he’s pointing,” he “wouldn’t have to wait so long for me to hand him X thing”, and he “doesn’t understand why you can’t just do what I say” as he’s not communicating his desires clearly.  “There’s no need to take so much extra time” when he can do it better/faster himself.  (Most of the time, he actually can; he’s a hard, efficient worker with a damn-near photographic memory. His eye for detail drives him batty.)   I can take a birds-eye view and see that he’s struggling with losing his job, with feeling a lack of purpose, with low self-esteem.  For fuck’s sake, I’ve been there myself just a few years ago.  His naturally-shorter-than-my-own fuse is running especially short nowadays, and he’s all but unaware of how distorted his thinking processes are becoming.  I can’t really be heard by him.  I’ve tried not responding to his tirades; he doesn’t really see when others are disengaging from a conversation and it leads to longer monologues on his part.  I’ve tried meeting his harshness by calling it out, even if only by saying “A simple ‘Not that one,  this  one to its left’ would suffice without the additional sarcasm, and I’d be happy to get it for you” – and admittedly some bitchier, rapid-fire responses –  something  to fucking get his attention on how he’s talking/responding so rudely to me.  It’s getting lumped in his mental category of “she’s complaining about something I’m doing again, FFS” and his verbal sniping is getting lumped in MY mental category of “He’s finding fault with something I’m doing,  again , god dammit.”   Suffice it to say that this is admittedly a one-sided story; obviously we’re all more nuanced than a three-paragraph condensation.  He does the majority of the household tasks.  He loves our dog and is so tender toward her, and  me in general  for that matter.  I’m not looking to leave; I’m looking to make life work with my chosen life partner who has faults just like I do.   I don’t know what to do and I’m exhausted.  All ears from this throwaway account.
I'll start from the beginning. My boyfriend and I started dating in October of 2009, so we have been together just over 6 and a half years. All was great, and I had no doubts. We knew each other's passwords and email accounts but I never thought to check any of them because why would I? In May of 2011, I saw him write down an email address I hadn't recognized before, and I got this gut wrenching feeling. So I went home and logged onto it, and there I found one sent message from about a year prior. They were nudes, and the recipient wasn't me. I confronted him and he told me he doesn't remember how it even happened or any of the context of the situation (he does have horrific memory, which may be due to a neurological disorder he was born with). This was 2 years into our relationship. Fast forward nearly 5 years, and I've turned into a psychopath. I can't go 2 days without checking his emails and his social media accounts, and when I'm with him (We live a little under 2 hours away from each other), I check his laptop and his phone when he's out of the room. He knows that I do all of this. I've never found any evidence of cheating, but when I find porn-like sites in his history, it drives me insane. This is hypocritical of me since I watch porn, too, just not as much as him. Regardless, if I can watch porn, why can't he? He trusts me, but ever since 2011, there is always a part of me that thinks he's hiding something. Other than this issue our relationship is amazing. We're looking into engagement soon. I just can't bring myself to trust him no matter how much I know he isn't doing anything besides normal guy stuff. I blame myself. Should I blame myself? What can either of us do to make things better? I've told him to change all of his passwords so I can't snoop, but then told him not to because it would drive me crazy because then I wouldn't know anything. I love him with all my heart and I know he loves me. He just made a stupid mistake at 16yo that I've tried so hard to forgive him for. We constantly fight over this, and this is the only big problem in our relationship. Am I wrong? Am I the crazy one? We just don't know what to do anymore.
I read an excellent [article]( on AMD's newest versus Intel's just yesterday. It's long, so for those who only read
Antennas are generally made out of a good conductive metal, that means loaded with little gaps. These little gaps are excellent places for electrons to go, so when a power source is connected to a transmitter/transceiver, it sends electrons through the wires and into the transmitter or transceiver which converts it into the proper transmission frequency and algorithm(in the case of digital signals). Each frequency has a certain wavelength, therefore an antenna of the right length produces the best results, the formula we'll use in this case will be the standard 468 / (Frequency in Mhz) = total length in feet[approx]. Different materials conduct electricity differently and should therefore be cut to the appropriate length, with some having a slightly different formula. Let's just say, the frequency is 28 Mhz, this means the antenna is going to have to be 35 ft. 11 inches long. Luckily, for reasons we don't totally understand, you can cut that length in half, and again to make a "quarterwave antenna" (8 ft 4 in.) which works fine.The signal then travels into the antenna in the form of electrons, travels up the length of it, and is pushed out of the antenna in a whip-like manner by the electrons flowing behind it. These travel just like light but at a much lower frequency. Sorry I couldn't explain it better, it's a complex subject and exists in my head as really just a pile of information I don't completely understand.   EDIT:
Hi. I'm looking for someone to photoshop a pic of Rush in the style that would be seen on /r/onetruegod. So basically, a face swap of nic cage on everyone in the picture (in this case, 3 people). I don't know much about photoshop, so I've listed three pictures in order of preference but any picture of Rush will do. I know I've listed three but I'm only looking for one (pick the easiest to photoshop).
I'ts pretty long cause i talk about how it was from the start with her to the end and after Would appreciate any for of insight here,   Well, i met this girl in december 2013 through a cuple of friends. i quickly fell for her and starting hanging out with her. The start was somewhat difficoult cause she had never had a boyfriend before and was a virgin, so it took time for her to open to me. i gave her time to feel well about me so she could open up for me. the months until end of school, june was just incredible after that we had a fight about she staying with me and what we should do about work and stuff. She ended up moving home after school was over for the year. it was hard to stay in touch becouse of the distance and chatting over internet didn't work out either.   the last 22 month she lived with me wasnt the best, i didnt give her the attention she deserved. i wasnt very good at finding things we could do together.   after she moved i knew this would go the wrong way if we didnt fix things, the issues. so i tried to get ger to talk about things, i forced the issue for her to meet me, said many stupid things.   we broke up, when she was getting her things i kissed her and she kissed me back.   a week or so i was supposed to meet her in the city the day we planned to meet she called and asked where i was. she thougt i was gonna meet her there, i asked the day before if i was gonna meet ther there or if shes coming over to my place. she never gave a real answer so i though she was coming over. when we talked on the phone i heard her sister in the background saying "Don't come if its too damn hard". i got angry and sadbut i put on my shoes and went to meet them. when i got there the anger and frustration just escalated in me when i saw her sister. but i was so happy too se my ex again. her sister was supposed to go shopping when i turned up but didnt. so we began talking, and i said that it was plain rude of her to say that on the phone. she tried to explain herself away. so i ignored her and talked to my ex instead. but when we talked i wasnt myself anymore. i was some other person, but when i talked her sister just sat there and laughed of everything i said, i couldnt talk about the things i wanted to cause she was there. suddenly me and her sister began to fight and i said something that made her rush off. and i felt horrible about that, but now i could talk to the girl i love.   i said to her if she can call her sister so i can apologize but her sister plain rejected my apology. me and my ex talked for about 20 minutes when she said she rather be with her sister than me.   also her sister wasnt happy about she hanging with me all the time so she didnt come home to see her and the family   It just looked like a play to me,i think her sister fooled us both   when i got home after i left, i sendt her a letter about how sorry i am for how things have been and that i want to do anything to make it work again.   The response i got was " All the insecurity ended today, I have it better without you. i will never give you a new chance so dont speak to me"   the 3 weeks after the day we met have been a nightmare for me I'm hating myself for screwing things up, i miss her more every day. all i want is for her to talk to me so i can make things right.   It all feels so wasted now, i got so many questions. things i could done different. i'm full of regrets. but the thing i never will regret is being with her! she is the best girl i can possibly think of and im willingly to try again if she wants, if she talks to me And if she is better without me i can accept that. the thing i can't accept is i dont know how she is doing, if shes ok. i feel atleast we should be able to talk to eachother. i love her and i will never stop caring     What can possibly be on her mind?   Is there something i can do beside hope for her to contact me if she misses me and have regrets? 3.
I have the upper half of a hockey stick (a goalie stick) that I want to extend to create a canoe paddle. The stick looks like  this . I want to add a wooden paddle to the end of the shaft. Now, here are the questions I have about this: what kind of wood should I use for the paddle? Some websites said to use a solid board of hardwood, while others said to use alternating hardwood and softwood. I have a Woodcraft I found near me where I assume I will be able to get the right kind of wood. The second question I have is attaching the wood to the foam. Will I be able to glue it, and will it hold up in water? I don't know anything about glue so I need advice as to what kind to use. My third question concerns the strength of the paddle. I will use the wooden core as support. How do I attach this to the rest of the paddle? I am assuming glue, but maybe there is another way I don't know about.   As far as the woodworking aspect is concerned, I've done very little woodworking but I think I can figure it out from the tutorials around the web. If there's anything special I should know about this feel free to chime in.
I had the opposite problem....I had a cryo burn done on a wart on my foot. The dermatologist cut it off with a scalpel and then froze it. A month later the damn thing was back but this time it had a twin! So now i had to live with two of these bastards on my foot. One night i was by the fireplace playing with the fire poker and noticed it had gone bright red. Well i decided to shave off the damn warts with my pocket knife and then i put the red hot tip of the poker on each of the warts. After the blisters disapeared there was no trace of the warts!
Hey Guys, I recently recieved 3 $25 codes through tech purchases (came in the shipping box). I tried out HAWKEN and found out it was not really my type of game. I figure some of you on here may want them though. I would happily trade them for some RP for League of Legends.   I will trade down (eg 25 for 20 or 25 for 10)   Also, to the Mods, if this is against the rules I apologize, please let me know and I will take it right down.
Warning, Long!   So me and my Girlfriend have been together for just over 2 years now and the relationship was amazing. She always put in so much effort into how she treated me and made sure she showed me how much she loved me (writing and sending me love notes etc) and I really appreciated how sweet that was, because no other girl has ever done that for me.   When we first got together everything felt like love; there were butterflies in my stomach whenever I met her and the kisses were filled with so much passion. But at some point this year, I've felt the love has faded. By this point we are obviously out of the Honeymoon stage and spending time with her feels more like an obligation/challenge rather than something I want to do (we live an hour apart). And the past 20 times I have gone to visit her, we've done nothing but lie down in her bedroom and cuddle, I've conveyed how I'd like to go out and do things with her (I'm a very active guy) even if it's just to the cinema, but she won't let me spend my money on her.   But now, the big issue is, that we're both going to university in September and so the relationship is going to be even more strained over the long distance. Am I really going to be motivated to spend £60 on a one-way train to see her for a day and sit around in her bedroom?   I feel as though we're not compatible anymore. We've spoke about our future together, marriage, starting a family etc. and at one point I wholeheartedly wanted that because I was so in love with her.   But now when I think about our future, I imagine one where I'm working all the time, going to the gym and doing active things when she sits at home and is unwilling to go with me if I ever ask her to come with me.   So I've been thinking it over and convincing myself more and more to end it before we leave, I discussed with her my issues over uni, and then she hit me with it.  "I can't live without you, if you leave me I'll kill myself".   Now I need to mention that she has a whole range of issues, ranging from a lack of confidence, a history of self-harming and severe anxiety. And one of the issues she deals with most, is not having any sense of self-worth. It's a very unhealthy relationship mechanic. Whilst she loves me to the ends of the Earth, she feels that without me she will be/have nothing, which is a horrible thought.   But right now she's emotionally blackmailing me to stay with her with the looming threat of suicide. Relationships just don't work like that.   I feel as though I want to go to University and meet new people,  maybe fall in love again. But I'm too scared to end it with her incase she does do anything, because then that would be completely on me and I'd never be able to forgive myself.   I'm trapped in this situation and I really don't know what to do, I realise that she probably needs some form of therapy/counselling but I'd be too scared to even suggest that as she is very unstable.   If you've read all of this, thankyou very much for your time, hopefully someone may be able to help me.
I initially started cutting when I was 12 for about two years, but have managed to refrain for a very long time. I am in a relationship with a man I love very much, but it is a difficult relationship at times. He struggles from PTSD and has just begun therapy for it. He's doing better, but when he has issues.... well, he has issues. He doesn't hurt me or belittle me or anything like that, but his trust issues surface and sometimes he becomes very depressed. I hate seeing him so down, and I always try to help him. Usually I can, but it is painful for me when I cannot.   Through issues of my own, I feel like I am at fault if he goes into a depressed cycle. He always tries to assure me it's not my fault, it's the PTSD, but I still feel this need to "make things better." Through this insane need to make things perfect, I get so upset that I have began to start cutting again. I feel terrible that I do it, and it is the only thing I hide from him. But cutting is the only thing that calms me down, and it also prevents me from getting closer to relapsing into bulimia nervosa again. I know that sounds insane, but cutting distracts me from feeling like a failure and it also prevents me from letting my mind wander towards my eating disorder again.   Basically, I need a way to keep myself from cutting. I know that if I came clean to my boyfriend he would be able to help me, but I also don't want him to think it is his fault. Truthfully, he has helped me so much with my eating disorder, but I am afraid to let him know about my cutting. I don't want to hurt him or disappoint him. I need some help, some advice, anythings.   Sorry for the rant, but I needed that off my chest.
While I was clearing act 3 inferno on my DH a very nice weapon dropped, long story short, I used it for a while then sold for 40m. Which I'm now using to gear my barb out.   What do you suggest spending it on? The obvious Justice Lantern, Storm Shield, Helm of Command? Trying to get decent rolls of those for a good price then get semi decent pieces for the rest of my armour?   I was thinking maybe getting those 3 at a reasonable price, then getting another 2 or 3 other really good items. Just so I'm not wasting money on crap which will be upgraded later down the line.   Barb currently being leveled and has 50-100k items in each slot (cheap crap), with a 630 dps weapon, 250 LoH and +300 LoH gem, 140 vit.   What do you reckon?
We broke up 4 days ago I don't think we should get back together (he initiated the break up but it was mutual) however, I have been considering my actions and I just genuinely feel that I need to apologize about some of the arguments we had recently and the things I said.   I have written a nice email telling him briefly the specific things I am sorry about and wishing him well.  He was worried that I would regret the time we were together and I want to just let him know I don't regret it but this was for the best.   Are these kind of emails ever a good idea?  I think it's pretty clearly not a "lets get back together" email but rather an "I respect you as a person and I want you to know I was wrong about these things".   The arguments were uncharacteristically emotional for us and I just feel terrible that it wasn't clarified that I was being unreasonable.
Yeah, admittedly I also thought Airon was wrong in the beginning and that he was some random who spread bad info, but he actually knows what he's talking about most of the time. I particularly agree with all of his opinions that people love to downvote for whatever reason. It has come to the point where people downvote Airon after seeing his name. Honestly, it's abuse of the downvote button.   The thing I hate seeing the most is when Airon gives his opinion like all the other idiots do on this sub but he gets downvoted 10x more than the stupid ass TSM flair comments that say something like "TSM was the 2nd best team at worlds this year"
Super interesting discussion!   Mastery>Crit is absolutely a worthwhile build. I've been contemplating a "cap" for myself in terms of crit with the most recent tier, at say perhaps 20%-15% sheet value.   Before I go on, the premise for my arguments below is that Disc is strong because of low overhealing by default. If a PoH were to top someone up, a crit (divine aegis) would not be wasted healing but rather most likely effective healing. This means that crit is not neccesarily an "overhealing" stat the way it can be for other healers.   An argument that can be made in your favor is that one of the more common playpatterns (that I subscribe to) has very few sources of DA. Using that build/priority DA happens primarily from these sources:     Emp Archangel POH     Penance     Cascade/other 90 talent (oh super curious if you ever pick another btw)     PW:Solace if you run it       Other sources (that are not used here) could be non-empowered Prayer of Healing, Holy Nova (lol...) and Heal/Flash Heal. Because the two main sources of healing are by default already non-overhealing spells (PW:S and CoW) increasing them with mastery makes sense due to the higher consistency.   However, what mastery>crit does not cover are the higher throughput patterns, and non perfect play. When mana becomes less important we will see a lot more PoH, and when you cast PoH crit becomes a far more valuable stat. Additionally, while mastery gives higher healing per point it does not cover some situations that can only be saved by "luck", in this case crit. Right now that is most prominent on tank healing and intensive healing (mythic Ko'ragh soakers for example) where base throughput is not enough to sustain those most intensive moments. Because crit is normalized you do have a certain guarantee in terms of burst healing that can be important to rely on in these times. As for non-perfect play, during progression kills will involve some amount of luck. Sometimes that luck is your shield critting on butcher on a DPS that got too low.   Regardless, I don't know everything and I'd love to hear your input. As far as haste goes we'll see it go up later in the xpac, but it will probably never go crazy far in terms of our weights as dropping spirit will probably provide higher throughput (as we saw during MOP).
Im going to assume you work corporate, which tends to have those kinds of problems.  Also, I am in the US so forgive me if this does not relate to your health care system.   There are pros and cons to the existence of corporate/governement health care clinics.   The main pro is that they are often situated in ways to treat the underprivileged and accept crappier insurance.  A group of patient's who would otherwise have NO access to care without your corporation at least has some, if not the greatest care.  They are able to provide this care in a way that private practices can't for a couple of reasons.  1) government subsidies or 2) mass production.  On that second point, reimbursement for these kinds of clinics is hardly enough to stay afloat, thus they have issues where pressuring their providers to "produce" is a thing.  It's a tradeoff in the sense that you are doing good by providing a service that isn't available to these people.  Some care is definitely better than no care at all.  However, the model is setup to fail.  You're on a sinking ship to try to treat these kinds of patients.  These corporations and government clinics know its not the greatest deal, so that's why they offer you all sorts of benefits right out of school to rope you in.  Loan repayments, no startup costs, etc.  You only have to compromise your morals to do it.   In private practice this tends not to be the case.  You get healthier people who are more pro-active about their own care with better insurance.  Because they have more money, you are much more free as a provider to do whatever is in everybody's best interests.  Also, theres the fact that you are your own boss, so there's nobody telling you what to do.   Personally, I think their is a private practice solution to "helping" people that I find much superior.  I'm going to try my best to make as crap-ton of money.  Then, once I am good to go and established the way I'd like.  I'll start doing occasional charity work, for free.
I'll chime in. I lost my faith when I was 23, and it was the most religious and crucial point in my life. What did it, what made me truly not believe anymore, was looking up at space. So far we're the only rock with life on it, so far. I can say for certain that when/if we ever make contact with another intelligent life form, their gods will be different, with different stories and different messages. There's no way it could be the same or even similar to Christianity because the influence would literally be of a different world. After that I realized it was all made up and there's no evidence for Christianity, I was wasting my time praying to an empty sky, and it was over. Faith gone. Finally. I stood there looking up at apace and my whole body went numb. I realized the lies, the wrong that I had done because I had believed in a false God. How much my faith had held me back in school and other areas of life welled me with anger. I had always been told that we, as the children of God, were the only creatures on earth to have souls. It was lies. I felt awful, I felt angry, i was so fucking pissed at myself for believing in something with literally no evidence and taking it as gospel. For. 23. Fucking. Years. So here's my answer: No, you cannot convince me that god exists. Its great your faith and everything, but you believe in something that you have no evidence for, you only have faith. Which is your ultimate shield to hide behind, so hide behind your cross and shield of faith, and believe! Even better yet, take your kids to church and watch their tiny little hands pray and hope and try to love god, when there will never be any love returned to them. Watch them struggle to understand evolution in science class, or the concept of how large the universe is or all the other shit the Christian community at large is trying to put into small influenceable little minds. This pains me the worst. Taking perfectly good minds and purposefully teaching them things that don't make sense or have no merit. Its the purest evil I've ever seen. When I lost my faith it was like looking at the world through a different set of glasses. I would notice things that agitated me that I would have never noticed before. Looking back on that moment, it was the happiest moment of my life and is when I consider my life to have started. My chains finally broken! I will quietly celebrate having lived more life with no faith than with faith when I'm 46. I feel as if I have escaped and if I am finally free! Imagine my dismay when I couldn't tell anyone else. Even worse, calling yourself an atheist is an open invitation to be prosecuted, hated, have "good christian" friends turn their back on you because of what you believe, or lack thereof. Christians hate us more than anything. They foam at the mouth, and try to tell me I'm agnostic, or that they hope i get my faith back. "Yessa master, i want mah chains back." How about fuuuck no! I'm a free man now, and I'll defend that freedom with the same tenacity I defend my freedom as an american citizen. You want my freedom, come and get it. ;) It's still freedom that I feel I've gained from my loss of faith and I share it when people come knock at my door with a book in their hands preaching. Or trying to whatever. I let those individuals know I have a warm guest room and a full table if they ever need anything, and that I will help them break their chains, if they so choose. I know this is kind of long winded, but I want to give a decent anecdote of my experience as an atheist, so that I can say this to answer your question: You cannot convince me of your God. You can however, convince me of your faith, which I will respect wholeheartedly and leave you to. I don't believe in what you do, but do not hate upon me, do not tell my children stories as truth behind my back, do not hate, because now that I'm not a part the church anymore, that's the only thing I see from it. Believe what you want, but understand that I escaped, my soul is free, and I don't want any of what your selling.
UPDATE: The dealer is going to replace all 4 tires free of charge. Basically, the purchase order agreement and the "we owe" slip clearly state that new tires were to be installed at time of purchase. Thing is, the dealer cannot find any evidence that they actually replaced the tires with new ones, nor did they give me any type of receipt for the tires. The regional "vw tire store" also has no record of these tires. Therefore, they're going to replace them in order to fulfill their end of the purchase order agreement. It seems wild to me that they've decided to go down such an honest path with me, but hey, I'll take it.   Here's what I think may have happened: The "new" tires they put on the car when I bought it might have been actually gently used from another customer who purchased a wheel & tire package and therefore wouldn't have needed the stock tires. Nevertheless, there is no paperwork showing this to be found.
Avoid that Kingston SSD. See [this thread]( as to why, including benchmarks from people that have bought them. The original PSA and warning about the drive on /r/buildapc is [here](
A little background;   We started dating about 9 months ago, and besides the disagreements with how we spend our time together and time with friends, it is generally a great relationship. I have been in one other serious relationship prior to this (6 years), and he has had three other serious girlfriends. Both our last relationships ended in a traumatizing way, and we were both single for the same amount of time (3 years). I developed some trust issues, as my ex was abusive and controlling and he was definitely hurt by his breakup, and had pretty much accepted that he wasn't going to find anyone else. Then we met. And it is the most healthy relationship I've ever experienced, and the feeling is mutual.   However, we do encounter issues when dealing how much time we spend together. He has a group of friends that started in high school. Long-term buddies; which I respect immensely. I just moved to this city two years ago, and haven't been able to form many meaningful friendships (other than him), and often find I'm missing the ones I have back home. So the fact that he is so loyal to his friends is one of the reason I love him so much. He is also introverted, and enjoys spending most of his time playing video games, watching movies and hanging out with his roommate (longtime friend). To which I respect as well, but the problem started when I noticed how he would get himself out of other social engagements.   He believes that small white lies can be told, but only if this doesn't cause any harm to the other person involved. So, if he feels like playing games instead of attending a birthday party, he thinks it is easier to make up a story, instead of telling them he'd rather just be home. I picked up on this behavior really quickly, and talked to him about it, and he reasurred me that he would never do that to me, and if he needed his time alone, he would tell me just that. I still couldn't shake the thought that he would probably do the same to me in time, and I believe this ignited a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.   Now, sometimes if I ask him to attend a family event, or just to hangout and he can't make it, my mind automatically goes to "oh, he is going to make up an excuse to not come" or he is lying. I guess he picked up on my behavior, and now when he does say I'm going to spend this time with my friends, or alone time, he feels nervous that I'm going to get upset. Then the when he reacts nervously it makes me suspicious, and we get into an argument.   We both feel this is very unpleasant, and neither of us want to communicate this way, but I can't help but feel suspicious, even when he has given me no real reason to be so; except for being a bit emotionally closed off and distant in the beginning (I believe due to fear) and how he deals with these situations with others.   We both really want to find a way in which we can communicate our time shared/seperate in a way that; I won't feel nervous asking him to hangout in fear of him cancelling or making up an excuse not to, and him not feel nervous about telling me he will be spending his time alone/with friends. Does anybody have any advice of how to go about this? We both can't seem to find a solution...
Hi everyone, I have a question about starting fermentation. I tried harvesting yeast from a couple cans of Heady Topper recently. I made a starter with 2c water + 1/2c DME, decant, then another 2c water + 1/2c DME. Not sure how well that worked because flocculated Conan looks a lot like clumps of DME. I brewed an IPA yesterday with OG 1.114 (a bit bigger than planned) and pitched the starter around 70 degrees. I also dropped a little starter in the test tube for a FFT. Now, 12 hours later, I see no action in the airlock and the gravity in the test tube hasn't changed.   Here's the real question: I'm leaving town in 24 hours for a wedding, and will be gone 4 days. If nothing changes by tomorrow morning, should I give up on the Conan yeast and pitch something else before I go? Would it be bad to wait and pitch a new yeast almost a week after brewing?   Thanks!
How much time do you want to invest? If you're willing to put in the time (over 50+hours) and are not opposed to reading the VN, do that.   I'd personally reccomend the PC realta nua version (google is your friend). It adds in some extra content and disables the sex scenes which i personally found jarring and out of place but that's just like, my opinion man.   But if VN's aren't your thing (they aren't for everyone) but you still want to get as full of a story as possible you could watch Deen's adaptation first. A lot of people give it a hard time because in addition to not aging well -especially when compared to Fate Zero- it also is an exceptionally poor adaptation of the original VN, and many serious fans will be quick to tell you that. That being said most of those people -like myself- were probably introduced to the Fate world by that adaptation and still managed to love the world enough to read the VN so they could properly hate Deen's adaptation, so take from that what you will. I would definitely not watch Deen's if you have already seen  Fate Zero just due to the massive quality difference and for the love of god stay away from Deen's UBW movie, Ufo's show is certainly going to be better and it will spoil a LOT.   If for some understandable reason or another you can't or won't watch Deen's FSN, you find yourself in a pickle. Watching Fate Zero first will spoil a little bit of FSN's story but waiting to watch the remakes first will spoil some of Fate Zero as well. I'd suggest watching Zero first on the off chance that Ufo's remake builds from Zero they might skip a lot of exposition and introduction to the Fate universe, something which Zero does in spades. Fate Zero is also on Netflix for your convenience.
Decided I wanted him after a bunch of veteran friends told me I couldn't get him, did research constantly camped for about a week. I was often the only one in the zone according to /who so I'd fly between waterfall and Brunhildar Village spawn since that's where I'd recorded the most Vyra spawns.   I'm talking hardcore, altered my sleep schedule camping, life revolved around the mount, it was awful. At 4 am one morning I'd been up for 18 hours flew to brunhildar, omw back to waterfall and NPC Scan goes off.   I moved as fast as possible.... Probably missed it by less than 20 seconds. Some lucky fucker questing through probably got it. Haven't camped it since.
It's a three page pdf...   Testing bodies AV‐Comparatives, AV‐TEST and Virus Bulletin comment on allegations of inappropriate behaviour   Today, three of the world’s most renowned and trusted security testing bodies, AV‐Comparatives, AV‐ TEST and Virus Bulletin, stand united to censure security vendor Qihoo 360 after finding the firm submitted products for comparative and certification testing which behaved significantly differently from those made available to its users and customers. The three testing bodies will revoke all certifications and rankings awarded to the company’s products so far this year, and going forward will insist on more open and fair dealings to ensure users are provided with the most accurate information possible.   Investigations by the three labs found that all products submitted for testing by Qihoo had one of the product’s four available engines, provided by Bitdefender, enabled by default, while a second, Qihoo’s own QVM engine, was never enabled. This included versions posted to ostensibly public sections of the company’s websites.   By contrast, as far as can be determined, all versions made generally available to users in Qihoo’s main market regions had the Bitdefender engine disabled and the QVM engine active. According to all test data this would provide a considerably lower level of protection and a higher likelihood of false positives. Options are provided in the product to adjust these settings, but as the majority of users leave settings unchanged, most tests insist on using the default product settings to best represent real‐world usage.   As part of the investigation into Qihoo 360, counter‐accusations were levelled by the company against two fellow Chinese security firms, Baidu and Tencent. Analysis of products submitted for testing by these companies turned up some unexpected flags within their products, marked with the names of several test labs and implying some difference in product behavior depending on the environment they were run in – similar flags were also found in Qihoo products. However, no evidence could be found that this gave any significant advantage to either product, and in some cases it even seemed to put them at a disadvantage. Both firms were able to provide good reasons for including these flags in their products.   On requesting an explanation from Qihoo 360 for their actions, the firm confirmed that some settings had been adjusted for testing, including enabling detection of types of files such as keygens and cracked software, and directing cloud lookups to servers located closer to the test labs. After several requests for specific information on the use of third‐party engines, it was eventually confirmed that the engine configuration submitted for testing differed from that available by default to users.   Qihoo’s awards and certifications attained since the start of 2015 will thus be stricken from the records by all three testing bodies, and all three will be imposing stricter demands on test participants to avoid any further gaming of results by vendors.   “This sort of thing doesn’t really help anyone,” said John Hawes, Chief of Operations at Virus Bulletin [editorial@virusbtn.com]. “Independent tests serve both users and developers, showing which products are performing best and highlighting areas where developers need to work harder. If the products being tested aren’t those being used in the real world, nobody’s getting any useful information.”   Andreas Clementi, CEO of AV‐Comparatives [media@av‐comparatives.org], said: “Independent anti‐ malware testing plays a key role in raising the standard of protection on users’ devices, which in turn makes the Internet a safer place for everybody. Misuse of such tests for marketing purposes will, in the long run, result in more successful malware attacks, making Internet users less secure.”   Maik Morgenstern, CEO of AV‐TEST [presse@av‐test.de], said: “Comparative testing and certification plays an important role in the anti‐malware industry, both for the users and the vendors. Users rely on independent results to make an educated decision regarding their protection software. If vendors start to manipulate the testing process, they are hurting everyone involved.”
So I've been playing TF2 off and on since 2008, and I'm finally pretty good - I can direct hit with rockets and grenades, win melee slapfights, snipe with the Sydney Sleeper, and play specialist roles (Twice this week I've been the top scorer on a server with the eyelander+targe+lochnload)   But I digress. What I need to know now is where to find a serious server - somewhere I can play regularly, get to know people, etc. Somewhere, hope of hopes where:     Each team doesn't have four engineers (in an 8v8)     OR four-five spies     OR (You guessed it!) four-five snipers.     Turrets are placed intelligently (On valve official server #9 last night I took down six turrets and 3 dispensers with the Direct Hit in a run)     Someone might even use a mic! Oh my stars!       ETC
Earlier this year, in may, I was wearing size XL shirts comfortably. Not too big, not too small, they were just right.   Today, I went to buy some new shirts, and I went in thinking maybe, MAYBE, I am a large now. Grabbed some shirts and tried them on and thought to myself... man this is still kinda baggy and I still look a bit homeless, so I did something that I was terrified of doing. I went and grabbed a couple mediums, all different brands and cut styles and OMG they all fit. I have not worn a size medium shirt since I think before high school.
When I was around twelve years old, I cut through a schoolyard in winter on my way to my friend's house, as I usually did. For some bizarre reason, there was a barbecue left stranded on a sidewalk near where I was walking. I thought it was quite odd, but though nothing of it and went on my way.   Eventually I arrived at my friend's house and we hung out there for about half an hour before hearing a knock on the door. We were in the basement, and I get called up the stairs and greeted by two police officers, one of which is holding my shoe and smirking at me. He asks me if it's my shoe, and I say yes. He then proceeds to take me outside, put me in the back of his car, and question me about  whether or not I just stole the fucking barbecue.   Apparently an eyewitness had seen a group of kids drag it out of the school, and just as they had abandoned it I was lucky enough to begin my journey through the park. The eyewitness described  me  in detail, thinking I was with them and just slow, and had the cops use my footprints to track me all the way to my friend's house. They were pretty proud they found me, which is why they looked so smug.   They questioned me for a long time, too. They refused to believe I was innocent and tried every trick in the book to catch me in a slip up so I would admit my "guilt." They were huge assholes about it, too, when I'm pretty sure they weren't even allowed to question and basically detain a minor without a warrant. I've never really liked cops since.
I have struggled with body issues since I was young. I've never been to therapy because I can't afford it but I have signs that point to Binge Eating Disorder. I am often triggered into eating massive amounts of food, often because I am upset/stressed or because I am feeling self-conscious and self-hating about my weight or appearance (doesn't make sense, I know). When I binge I often eat until I feel sick, I always want to puke but I am not physically able to make myself throw up. I keep it very secretive, hiding receipts or wrappers, nobody knows about this.   I have gained about 20 pounds over the past year and I am trying to be healthy and get back down to a healthy weight. But my self-image issues and the fact that I now feel fat and disgusting are triggering me back into my coping method which is bingeing. It feels like whenever I focus on trying to lose weight, it makes me have to pay attention to myself which leads to a lot of self-hate.   I want to break the cycle once and for all and become healthy and happy, but I don't know where to begin. Nobody I know has ever suffered from anything like this and I have nowhere to reach out to, so I'm reaching out to the ladies of 2X. Any advice, musings, or helpful words of encouragement?
I'm frugal but I have pretty much a perfect clean/overdrive set up. Guitar: Epiphone Les Paul w/ EMG 60X in neck, 81X in bridge FX: Hermida Audio Zendrive, BBE Sonic Stomp Amp: Bugera V22   All of this was about $1200. and gets me the tone I want.   Now onto your setup: You already have a great clean/overdrive amp. I would strongly suggest adding a sonic stomp to the end of your FX line. If you use any pedals, especially distortion/overdrive pedals, the sonic stomp makes them sound 10x better.   The other suggestion would be to upgrade your speakers. I'm in love with the Hellatone 60's, and when I get the cash I'm putting one in my amp. They are Celestion Vintage 30's that have been broken in, and are cheaper.
I've been with my boyfriend for around a year now and in September we'll be (hopefully) going off to university.   He recently expressed some worry; he asked me "do you know any couples who have managed to stay together at uni despite the temptations all around them?" He thinks the lack of physical intimacy and affection is what leads to relationships crumbling. I think it's down to how the parties involved approach the relationship.   What are some things that, in LDRs, it's better to know sooner rather than later?
Halligan, my 2 year old cat, will  meooooow  and  meooooow  outside my door,  no matter how long I've been in bed if she hears me say anything to my husband, even if it's just for me to tell him to move over to his side. We can't keep the door open for her at night because she runs wild and won't quiet down for us to sleep. She knows I'm in there but it's like she has to beg me to open the door since she knows I'm awake.... but this is also the same cat that stands on her hind legs like a prairie dog when she's intrigued by something and races me to the toilet when I get up in the morning just to stand on the lid so I have to guide her off.
I literally was about to write this as I was clicking on the comment section, I was considering spelling and was gonna open a new tab to google it and verify.  I probably wouldn't have linked to anything though, but I'm glad you did.
Isn't the 3v3 gamemode perfect for prpfessional play as well? I have played 3v3 ranked since season 3 and have enjoyed the change in pace. This would change the pace in competitive. Twisted Treeline would have more exciting commentary as laning features more frequent fights because the map is smaller and features closer objectives (altars). On average, the games would be relatively shorter as well.
My story is a little long and on-going first a little background.   I am a single parent right now while my wife is deployed. Last night, I had just bought a FoodSaver (vacuum sealer) and was in the process of vacuum sealing everything I possible could, when someone knocks on the door. Against my better judgement, I open it and a woman is standing there and she introduces herself as an art student selling art to "cover costs so her and her 12 friends can open an art gallery in San Francisco". She also says something about an art school in Israel or something, a few details I brain dumped, but she also said pretty fast and with a deep accent.   Flag #1. I live in Fairfield, CA. An hour from San Francisco, in a pretty random neighborhood.   I have to admit, I was distracting with the dog, the "lets seal everything possible" project in the kitchen, the kid and a few of the bare walls in my house. So I bit a little. Okay, a lot. They were pretty nice oil paintings. I'm somewhat a sucker for art. I let her in to get a better look at the paintings.   So she comes in. The prints she has are smaller, and they are oil paintings. As I am looking at them, I can tell they are mostly impressionist style paintings mostly of Venice. My guess, is this is because they are easier to re-create. Right away, another flag goes up.   Flag #2. I have not studied art, but these seem familiar. Also, I have traveled through Italy, and the places depicted in the painting are of some of the areas I've told her and shes claiming Greece and Israel.   At this point, shes also asking questions, random questions. Where do you work, where is your wife, etc, etc. I give her a few answers and ask her about the larger ones her friend has. She calls him and he shows up and unrolls quite a few large paintings.   This whole story really doesn't get crazy to be honest. So I will spare the mundane details. Basically, they go on the big sell, we "negotiate" and I pick up two large paintings for $625. They leave, I look at the time and holy cow its late. Once I send the kid to bed and I have the rest of my house vacuum sealed, I check the internet because this still doesn't seem right. In the back of my mind, I am still thinking some of those pictures are familiar, and why is someone going door-to-door selling paintings of all things. Sure enough. I find a few links:   Links to Chinese wholesale oil paintings.   Simple "Google" search.   I put a "hold" on the check and the rest of this will play out next week when they try and post the money. Below are pictures of the paintings. I will probably contact my local law enforcement and see what they say, as well as my base to give them the heads up.   Pictures.
I would find it extremly good ,when you not only could choose which race you are playing . That you can also select the race for every matchup. So like that i like zvt and zvp ,but i hate zvz and now i could play zvt ,tvp and TVZ and prevent this awkward matchup (for me). That you can "delete" your least favorite match up and play in this matchup with a other race. I think it would also help to prevent ladder anexty ,cause many players arent playing cause for example they are saying "I dont want to play anymore tvt (or zvz or zvp etc...). With this little step you could prevent it. And you could make the game a little bit nicer. Sorry for my bad Englisch T.T.
Well, since i already exploded in the Kubcraft chat, i might as well go out with it.   The reason I rage, isn't anger issues, it's a mental problem Pretty much, when i get mad, I become way more mad then a normal person would.   So if I have ever raged to you in chat, first off, I'm sorry, I usually feel bad after calming down, and regret my rage.   The only reason I haven't stated this before is because I was scared.... Scared people would treat me differently, it happens sometimes and I didn't want it to happen here, since I have already came out with it to some community members though, I decided, may as well post this.
What's up EMS? As we all know we're not exactly the highest grossing bunch on the planet and the economy isn't exactly stellar. So I'm sure some of you guys have picked up second jobs for covering the mortgage or just for play money. My question is what job did you pick up? I'm currently looking for something that will pay decent and still leave me time for fun and rest for work.
I’ve read through threads on here about  aggressive GGing  and I enjoy the odd [ragequit] ( photo.   But my own idiosyncrasy in this matter is that I GG everyone. Even at my mid diamond level less than half of my opponents GG before leaving, so I pop a GG in a chatbox on the results screen. Far from pissing people off I’ve found it often leads to a conversation. The opponent will often talk about why they thought they lost, or why they thought I won. Quite a few even apologise for the no gg, and say how uncharacteristic a ragequit is for them.   If I’m angry from a loss talking helps to vent that, and I hope it does for those I engage over chat. I like this community and see civility and sportsmanship as the one thing I can do over and above just playing the game. Any thoughts?
Hello everyone. I've noticed that many of us are angry about an element of chance being introduced into the game. These purists are concerned that chance will ruin PvP. I'm here to show you that if an element of chance is minor enough, it will not ruin PvP and will actually make PvP better.   1) RNG does not reduce skill.   Look at a game with high RNG like Poker. The same players qualify for the big tournaments every year, with a few consistently winning. This idea that RNG is the antithesis of skill is completely unfounded. RNG introduces an element of skill defined by minimizing losses when unlucky, and maximizing gains when lucky.   2) RNG can make PvP better.   A.net is right in saying that these opportunities are needed to keep the game exciting. Without RNG the game may be reduced to a simple progression of a few characters moving between points in an identical manner every game. RNG makes each game different, creating "opportunities" in which good play is rewarded (by minimizing losses, maximizing gains), and prevents a sort of algorithmic strategy. Make no mistake; this will be what makes great players shine above others who just push the buttons at the "right" time.   3) RNG can be balanced.   If you consider a static skill that does 100 extra damage per swing, and an RNG skill that does 500 exra damage, 20% of the swings, these two skills are nearly identical. 5 swings will occur in a matter of seconds. It is HIGHLY, HIGHLY, unlikely that someone is going to get 5 of these procing effects in a row, and even less likely that this will occur at the right time to "win the game," as has been suggested. The only difference is that one skill is controlled, while the other creates times of less damage and times of more damage, which both players will have to respond to.   4) The game needs RNG.   A few months ago there was some concern about "comebacks" in PvP, and how the capture format made it very difficult to win from behind. These concerns were valid. RNG helps alleviate that hopelessness. It's not about having 0 points, getting lucky, and winning. It's about having just a few less points (which is tough against a great team) and persevering in the hope that an opportunity will present itself. This doesn't meant that a bad team will ever win against a good team. It just means that between two teams who both play great, the fight is never really over.   Thanks for reading. :)
When I was 7 my dad was a successful business owner in Russia. Somebody found out about that and while my parents were at work and some gypsy came to my house with his kids. When he knocked on the door I looked through the peephole and it was covered with a hand, so I asked "Who is this?", some kid said "It's me!", I asked "who?" they continued saying it is me. Anyways some voice inside me told me that it is not a wise decision to open that door and I said to them I am going to call my parents. They left, and a few years later my parents tell me the story that someone took our neighbors kid for ransom and when parents could not come up with the money kid was found dead near some highway.
I wear things that serve a function.   I wear a fleece hat when it's cold. I wear a baseball hat when I need to keep the sun off the top of my head and my face. I wear a hardhat in construction and work zones. Dress hats, mostly, do not serve a practical purpose beyond co-opting a perceived air of respectability. Some cat out there may think that they look pretty slick in their hat, but in reality, all it says is that he probably invests more in his wardrobe than his actions.
I've been unsubscribed for a few months now, mainly because I don't really use the online service rather than the IGC, but a poor IGC has kept me from resubscribing. I love indies and I love AAA games, and I'd take Guacamelee or Rocket League over any generic AAA game.   Here's the thing no one seems to understand, we can't encourage Sony get (more?) complacent. They're all over the place, with unpredictable announcement dates, low budget games (even if they are superior in quality, they are cheaper). If you can enjoy the games offered every month, great, but the whole point of reacting to these announcements isn't to give a reasonable response, it's too make some noise. TO WHINE, TO BITCH, TO COMPLAIN LIKE OUR GAMING FUTURES RELY ON A AAA IGC.   This is all assuming Sony is even paying attention to any of this, but my point is, if we can whine online with the off chance that it'll work, it'll need hyperbole. "Bro Force is enjoyable while Galak Z and the other indies people seem to hate are perfectly fine, and although I don't use the online service often, I appreciate the "free games"". Do you see posts like that motivating Sony? Do corporations really need our pity and defense now? It's a paid service at the end of the day and it's clear many customers are unhappy.   You may call my logic flawed, and the only vote that truly matters is your wallet, but if you wanna get your way you have to be a difficult and loud (not at other customers), and I feel like, speaking for myself but others may voice their opinions, that by being vocally "okay or content" with the current line up, you neutralize the voice of those of us who'd like to see improvements in the service.   No salt, no intended flame war, I'm not currently subscribed so couldn't care much about next months line up unless it looks good to me. Just voicing a point I feel gets buried in the toxicity.
I was 150lbs 6'0 at the beginning of this most recent summer. I ended up gaining 20 lbs (170lbs body weight) by the end of summer. I've always been one of them people who was always told to eat more and to get meat on my bones.   Here is what I did. My diet consisted of everything. Literally everything. I ate anytime I felt a little hungry. I completely cut doing cardio - I ran track the previous year at a D3 college. My metabolism was incredibly fast so I estimated around 4,500-5,000 calories a day. I never stuffed myself that I felt bloated or anything like that. I ate a lot of steak burritos with veggies from sheetz (about 3 or 4 times a week). I also tried to eat pasta at least twice a week. When I ate pasta, I ate as much as I could without feeling sick. Other than that nothing was really consistent. Mac n' cheese and chicken nuggets, but I just ate whatever I found at my house every time I got hungry. I always went to bed full and ate first thing in the morning.   Here is what I did around workout time. I took preworkout every day (creatine containing) before lifting. My workouts consisted of anywhere depending on 4 exercises to 8 exercises depending on how I felt that day and how busy/tired I was. My reps were either 5 or 8 (not in between unless I couldn't finish a set). I always did 3 sets for every exercise. After my lift I would take standard whey protein. I did 2 scoops with 12 fluid oz of whole milk. Then I would eat a small-average sized meal to help replenish my energy and nutrients. I've never taken a mass gainer, but it could be something you might want to look into. Also, make sure you sleep enough at night. This should help with muscle recovery and allow you to lift at your best the next day.
Definitely. Down to all but the very smallest details, antimatter interacts with antimatter just as matter interacts with matter. "Antimatter" is a misleading name, as it is not some kind of absence of existence or mysterious universal abomination; it's simply a second kind of matter.   Maybe this will help: think of a normal particle as a vector, with a magnitude and direction. An antimatter particle has the same magnitude, but the opposite direction. When we are looking at relatively simple stuff (like atomic interactions between smaller atoms, as is required for life), we only care about the scalar magnitude, so long as everything is in the same direction. You get problems when two vectors have the same magnitude but opposite direction and cancel each other out, leaving a lot of energy (E = mc^2) but no way to contain it as mass.
That's because they're fucking morons.   Lets get a few things straight, the issue with the NSA surveillance was about an invasion of privacy, a complete lack of respect for the Constitution of America and a complete lack of respect for the rule of law in the UK and the complete immorality of the action.   It was not, as much as people would like to believe, about them watching us. Why? Because there's no fucking possible way they were watching us.   The amount of data that was being stolen annually would have had to have a ridiculously huge work force to analyse, collate and document for it to in anyway shape or form to be defined as watching on such a scale that it's not realistically possible unless everyone at the NSA and GCHQ were working on it.
Hi there /r/sysadmin, I've never felt really qualified enough to make a post here, and while I'm still not maybe I'm on the path to one day being a contributor. I'm an independent repair tech, most commonly handling the grueling tasks of such things as; Windows reinstalls and laptop cooling exhaust cleaning. Recently though I have been making my way into small businesses, handling some of their networking and such. I have to say I do enjoy this much more. But what I came here for, your expertise is for a more specific situation (if you don't mind of course).   I have the opportunity to work with a local non-profit children's museum. Specifically the task at hand is replacing their dinosaur of a server with something a bit more modern. I think I am fairly comfortable with picking out the hardware for the build, as they don't require something amazing I will probably pick up a good deal that I see floating around on CL all the time. They are replacing a single core Xeon in a box the size of a desk btw. The main tasks of this unit is just handling backups, and being Quickbooks server. It's running Windows Server 2003. I need to implement the new rig as seamlessly as possible, and it will also be running a newer version of Windows server. Any tips for that? I was thinking to ask to go in one night after hours and handle it then. I know this is a very general question, but about how long do you think the task should take? What's the best way of migrating data between the two boxes? What would a professional charge for a job like this (obviously I'm not trying to do that), and how long would this take a professional? I'm sorry if the information is relatively vague, it's all I have to work with currently. But thanks for your time.   Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this post, but I couldn't seem to find a more qualified one.
Good Morning Guys;   I've never been interested in growing my facial hair beside my goatee and soul patch that I have currently. Never been interested in growing a beard, however recently I've been thinking about finally growing a mustache. My problem is I have NO IDEA WHATSOEVER on how to maintain such a thing. I don't really have a male figure in my life I can approach to ask for facial hair advice. When I google "how to shave" I just videos on exactly what I've been doing my whole life which is simply removing all the hair in a particular areas and not shaping it. The one failed attempt I made before I attempted to use my razor to shape my mustache since I was starting to look like a plumber and it looked disgraceful to me I just shaved it all off. I currently use the Gillete Proglide Fusion razor which feels great on my face, and also have a Wahl trimmer set I never use. Regardless to what add-ons I attach to it it never actually cuts crap and I just get a bunch of razor bumps on my face. Only time I get my face looking crazy sharp is when I go to the barber and let him do his thing.   Background:   African American   23 years old   curly hair   stubble
Looking at the screen again makes me feel so bad, I remember someone posting it in the twitch chat after the game :(
I run a furniture store.  After Hurricane Katrina a lot of people from Louisiana relocated to my city.   The Salvation Army gave out a LOT of vouchers for them to get FREE furniture.   Here's how it works:  Customer gets voucher, brings to my store, we load that voucher up with as much as we can get them for that dollar amount, they get it all FOR FREE, delivered FOR FREE, Salvation Army pays the furniture, everyone is happy.  We helped a lot of very grateful people, many I still have as customers today.   This one lady, though,  she got her FREE stuff delivered.  She said that there was (gasp!) a small scratch on the coffee table leg.  Ok. Cool. We have a guy who can make that good as new IN HER HOME.  I call her and tell her that we will send him out whenever it is convenient for her.  She says "Oh, no you will NOT.  You will bring me a brand new coffee table. I paid too much for this."   Well.   I paused, and said quite seriously, "Oh, I am so sorry....I must be looking at the wrong sale in the computer, the only thing I have here with your name says that the Salvation Army gave it all to you for free."   I know I was right, and I regret nothing, but it goes against every rule of customer service that I abide by each day.
I am at the point where getting into a relationship seems like a stupid and unreachable dream, something out of a movie, something that you wish, but deep inside, know that is impossible. It becomes tiring, stressing and even annoying getting rejected every time. A 100% of the time when I think I have a chance to get closer to someone, fate decides to show me how wrong I am to even think that. Things always go around the same loop where: I ask someone out, we date a couple of times and when I feel like we can get serious, they always answer with the typical:  “I don’t feel the same about you”, “I see you more like a friend/brother”, “I don’t wanna commit to a relationship right now”, “I feel like things would not work out between us”, “I am sorry but I am don’t want anything serious right now”, “Maybe we should see someone else before committing”, etc.   My last attempt to get a girlfriend was with a girl (I’ll call her Mary for safety reasons) from school. Things looked really good from my end, we dated multiple times, dinner, movies, coffee, walk around various places, but alas, the problem happened when we got this deep talk about past experiences with other people, like some really deep stuff, this was of course during our last date. She asked me for advice about her last boyfriend who had dumped her because according to him she was “too soft” and that if she wanted to get together again she needed to get more “though”, naturally, I told her that she shouldn’t lose her time a guy that wants her to change her whole persona, that there’ll always someone else, someone who will like her for who she is and value her because of that. The rest of the date was kind of awkward after that talk and I drove her to her house after getting some coffee, arriving home confused and wondering what I did to make her uncomfortable. Mary usually greets me with a warm hug and smile when we meet up at school, this day however was nothing like that, there was no hug, no smile, she did not even look at me when saying hi, I was given this cold and pretty much forced salute along with a feel of uneasiness, something that would continue through the entire day, she also kept avoiding me, ignoring me or leaving a group of people if I joined. This got me more confused, and made me ask question myself more and with this uncertainty I asked a friend (I’ll call her Amy), a friend that is a close to both of us about what had happened, Amy told me that Mary felt to overwhelmed by me, that she did not only she did not felt the same way for me but also had the impression that I wanted to force a relationship between the 2 of us. Obviously this crushed me, so I begged Amy to clear the confusion and bad impression since Mary would just avoid me, I asked her if she could please tell Mary that it wasn’t my intention to make her feel like that nor I wanted to force anything and that I would stop looking for her or even stop talking to her if that’s what she wanted, Amy obviously agreed, but I could tell that she felt genuinely sorry for me. The following day Mary and I talked and agreed that we should remain as friends and that things would return to how they were before, but, as you all can guess they never did and now even being in the same conversation is awkward. I cried a lot during those days, asked myself what did I do wrong and why was I not of her liking.   This is not the first time I have been rejected, but it’s the first time that someone else had to tell me that the person rejected me and  THAT  is what hurt me the most. I have been used, cheated, tricked, lied to and even humiliated by some of the girls I tried to date and like a dog chasing its own tail, I blindly go after another girl sometime later when I get over the last, just to get the same result. Normies say that you only need to be yourself and that eventually you’ll meet the right person that will value and love you the same way you do to them, I have 21 years and I never had anything remotely close to a girlfriend, I know it takes time to find the right person, but how am I supposed to know that it’s the right person if I get rejected all the time. No matter how much we are alike, if we have the same tastes, how many time we’ve known or if I get in shape or not, reject, no matter what. The pain, stress and time I have wasted on relationships along with the money for dates and gifts would probably be enough to get me any material object of my desire. So be it, I am done, starting today I will no longer care about getting a relationship, I am tired of the pain and waste that come with it, whether I try or not I’ll die alone with no one to even remember my name anyway.
Things I don't give a shit about:     Pictures/Videos not being in Russia. If content HAD to be russian, it would be all addidas and slav squats, which it was for a while. Like the sidebar says: >Content doesn't have to be strictly Russia, your visualization of a normal day is good enough. We're here for laughs after all.     Reposts that aren't on top of all time.     <no reason> reports. Without a reason I won't even check the content of a post. I just check the users history with mod toolbox, and if they seem to be a spammer, I remove it. Otherwise, it stays up.       Things I do care about:     Spam. Plugging your youtube channel 14 times a day is not allowed here. Feel free to check my post history for /r/spam reports of people doing exactly that. If you do this, and /r/spam doesn't ban you, I will just ban you from here, or better yet, add your shitty clickbait channel to the media filter in automod and ignore you in modmail.     NSFW pictures. Gore/death is straight up not allowed. Not tagging NSFW posts will get you a warning, and the next time it happens you get a ban for a few days.     The rest of the rules.       I handle most of everything that goes on here these days. I only remove spam, because almost everything here  doesn't break any sub rules . Sometimes I get drunk and make sticky posts of swf files, but generally I leave everything alone and laugh at the shit you guys find.
Ok, so to give a little history.  We split up with her telling me I did nothing wrong and that she needed to work on herself and learn to stand on her own two feet, she has never moved out of her parents house (not because she didn't want to though) and has never had that spurt of maturity that comes along with it.  She said some things though have been puzzling me, like, "I just think we wan't different things".  I think I got complacent in our relationship and stopped doing the things that made her fall in love with me in the first place.  She was coming up with all of our activity ideas and I only wanted to have sex anytime we were alone and my stupid need to always be right (a problem I am always working on but its hard) I think made her feel inferior, and I think I drove her away and made her unhappy.  I want to meet up with her and explain all this at least to just apologize to her.  I would love a second chance but I don't think I will get one, but I owe it to her to at least explain and apologize.  Is that a good idea?  I love this girl more then anything in the world, and I am full of so much regret and would move mountains in order to go back in time and act differently.  Reddit, I done fucked up and bad.
This is gonna be long. I apologize in advance. I'm a 17 year old straight female, by the way.   I met a boy over the summer when I was 15 (two years ago). I was dating someone else who turned out to be not the nicest guy, and my friend (we'll call him A) was there to help me out through a pretty nasty breakup. When the summer ended we parted ways (we live 1,000 miles apart) but we remained very close friends, texting and chatting regularly. Last summer, we grew even closer and started a long distance relationship. Things were really, really great for a while, but after Christmas (his first visit to me since we started dating) thigns started to deteroriate. We were fighting and arguing all the time, and I was desperate for things to work out. When he visited me over Easter, we had sex (we were both virgins). I figured it was something he wanted a lot and would make our relationship stronger, but it didn't make that much of a difference, I guess. We broke up a few weeks after that. He had certain  compromising  pictures of me that he then shared with a mutual friend after our breakup. Finding out about that and the way they talked about my body and appearance (I'll give you a hint: not very nicely) totally crushed any self confidence I had remaining after the breakup. I know, it was dumb about the pictures, and I should've known better, but I got them to delete them after threatening charges (I was 16 in the pictures so it woulda been CP) and got that all resolved. I still can't help but feel like it was my fault for stupidly trusting my boyfriend like that.   Well, beyond the self-confidence and trust issues (a barrel of giggles, I know), I'm really, really uncomfortable with the idea of getting into another relationship. My experiences with sex weren't enjoyable AT ALL for me (I was really just doing it for my boyfriend's sake), and it killed any sex drive I had. I've never had much of a sex drive, to be honest, I've never masturbated or anything, and I was always uncomfortable with my boyfriend going down on me or fingering me. I think some of it may be to do with his technique (very jabby and not pleasant), but I've  always  been uncomfortable with the idea of masturbating and getting touched and stuff down yonder. I like making out and some physical stuff, but I just don't want to go any further. It scares me, because I feel like I'm never going to be able to find a boy who's okay with that. My previous boyfriends have been very physical and it makes me uncomfortable, but I want to make them happy so I just kind of go along with it. I'm starting to wonder if I'm asexual, or if it's just that I'm dealing with a lot of shit from this breakup. Thanks for  anyone who manages to read all of this!
upadte] This whole thing has been resolved. I didn't realize my response to the top comment was down voted so much and people weren't expanding the thread to see it. Also, I know it's bad retiquette to complain about down votes, but I'm unsure as to why my reply to the top comment is getting so many all of a sudden. I honestly don't care about karma, but an explanation would be awesome. Thanks to everyone that helped me out! Jill and i's relationship is much stronger now after all of this.   I'll try to break it down as simply as possible so it's not too long of a read.   Backstory   For starters, I am madly in love with a girl/lady/woman who I would absolutely love to marry and spend the rest of my life with. This is still a young relationship. I'm 27, she's 20, but we have known each other all of her life... Lets call her Jill. Jill and I have been romantically involved for about 4 months now, long distance.   Right, so... in the past, I have been a really shitty boyfriend and fairly shitty person altogether. I have had insecurity issues, lied, and manipulated a good deal. It has made for some terrible relationships and over the years have grown sick and tired of my own self sabotage. I decided that I love this girl SO much, and I want this to work SO badly, that I will hold no lies or secrets from her because she deserves nothing but the truth always... then I pray to all religious figures in existence that she will still love and accept me regardless.   I think you're getting an idea of where this is going...   So here's what I just told her about:   There's another girl I have had a history with. Lets call her Betty. Betty is currently engaged. I asked her to hang out today, but she said she wasn't available because her SO was going to be home soon.   Betty and I are very sexually compatible and are easily tempted by each other, but there is some genuine care and regard for the other person. I could immediately tell there was something weird in her statement and called her out on it, asking if I was being kept secret from her dude. She said no, but that he wasn't comfortable with the idea of me. I decided to clear things up and simply the issue by establishing some easy to follow boundaries to avoid any issue for all parties involved, which mainly means no hanging out together under any sort of circumstance of potential bad decisions, primarily those involving us being alone and intoxicated. Here's where I'm worried. I told the love of my life about said conversation and said decision. I'm not tempted by this girl, but the male sex drive is kind of a pain in the ass. The primal side of me sees the attraction in Betty, but I desperately do not want to cross that line, so the boundaries were set to ensure that won't be a problem. I can say that I could more than likely restrain myself with her, but I don't want to make that assumption and get myself in a situation where I'd do something stupid, so I'd rather avoid the problem altogether.   Does that make sense? So, now my lovely lady Jill is upset. I had a feeling she would be, but I felt this was important to tell her, to show her the steps I'm taking to make sure things don't get messed up, but I'm not sure I did it the right way and I'm not sure exactly what I should do next or if there is anything I can do now besides wait.   Have I been too honest? Please discuss. I will be completely open about anything and everything and would love a greater insight into the female perspective. Any advice is appreciated.
Necrotic flesh, or more specifically, flesh that has been afflicted by Gangrene.  I work in the O.R. and it is not entirely uncommon for diabetics to come in with a toe or finger that has been affected by gangrene; usually resulting in amputation.   Decaying flesh gives off a very foul and unique odor.  A sort of sickly-sweet smell that sticks in your nostrils for a while.  It is unlike anything I have ever smelled and is difficult to describe.  To add to this, a common symptom of gangrene is often a foul-smelling discharge which only adds to the aroma.
I was making fun of my cat for being a fatass, from across the room he walked over to me and bit me.
So I'll just say some stuff that I think could pertain to Asperger's within my life.   I remember being suspected for Autism back when I was in Kindergarden. In fact, about half of my family had to go through it (family of 8), since we all are kind of messed up in our own ways. They tested me with suspicion on the fact that I just simply didnt talk to anyone, and they said while I was harboring some traits, I wasn't autistic perse. They weren't testing for Aspergers though, just specifically Autism.   I have a family history of disorders and stuff like that. Older brother has Bipolar. Sister has Social Anxiety, though she mostly has it cleared up in her lifce. etc. etc. I have been diagnosed with Social Anxiety, Depression, and ADD.   I really am in a state of social retardation. I have "friends" I guess, a close group of about four about. However, I don't think they would really consider me a good friend. I don't really invite them over to do anything. Really they are only acquaintances for school most of the time, to pass time (Junior in HS BTW). I do get occasionally invited to stuff, maybe two times a month, but lately people have stopped inviting me to stuff. I've had a lot of suspicions as to why, and they're probably right. In all honesty, the only reason that I have friends is cause a situation I was forced into turned out pretty good for me (long story about a Chinese exchange student). Apparently I also talk a lot about myself a lot, and admittedly, I don't care about others that much. It's rare that I actually sincerely care about what someone has accomplished, or done, or what they like. Sounds horrible when I type it out.   My social interaction with peers in general is kind of esoteric. I know eye contact is just horrible; most of the time, when talking, my eyes will dart all around the place. A common place I look at though is the lips for some reason on someone. Rarely can I maintain eye contact for a solid three seconds without feeling... something. I don't know how to describe it, but i just HAVE to look away. Its odd. I also have not the best way to describe things. For example, I can know a lot about a subject, say like a video game or something, but when someone asks me something like, "Oh whats the story about?", stuff like that, I'll just stutter and try to get it out, which results in a really awkward exchange, or I'll spend 5 minutes trying to say something which could've been said in 30 seconds. People say I usually have a flat face in general; whether that be from depression, Asperger's, or another unknown force, IDK. They also say I have a monotone voice, which I don't think I do, though I guess they could be right.   I tend to say a lot of wrong things. I'll say things that sound perfectly fine in my head, but then suddenly everyone gasps or something like that. I got labeled a misogynist once because of that. Got into a argument with a woman who is really dedicated to advocating woman and LGBT rights. Went really bad because I didn't know how to defend myself; I thought I said something decent and, y know, NOT misogynistic.   I can't really read faces that well. In fact, I realized someone tried to ask me out to prom like a month ago, and I finally decoded what she was trying to say. Hate myself for that one. I constantly have to ask things like, "Are you bored?" or, "Are you mad?" cause I legitimately just don't know and it helps me out.   I have a good amount of interests I think. I like to watch anime a lot, some tv shows occasionaly, a lot of video games, and read fiction, occasionaly non fiction. However my trump card for anything is dragons. Sounds weird, but I'm just obsessed with them. I love to learn the lore and myths surrounding them in the Ancient World, as well as the worlds of those myths crafted in fiction as well. If anything has dragons in it: books (I recently read one called Talon, was kinda disappointing in it but whatever), video games, anime, fan fiction (yeah I know, kinda weird), even wrote a couple of stories about dragons myself. I also have some "lore" books about what different authors think dragons are, what they do, how they hunt, what they hunt, where they live, etc.   I've always had some poor skills in really basic things. For example (embarrassing to admit), I still don't know how to tie my shoes properly, at the age of 16. I learned how to ride a bike finally at age 14. I went to a friends house for the first time at the age of 15. Stuff like that.   I also like to do some ticks. Stuff like rubbing my hands in my pockets, twirling something REALLY fast, repeatedly shaking my leg, etc.   I've always thought in a sort of "movie cinematic" style. Mostly anything I think of I can clearly visualize within my brain. I have sweeping camera shots, cinematic shots for dramatic effects, appropriate music for a scene, transition scenes, etc. Really weird, I know.   This isn't all of what I think pertains to if I have it or not, but its a good chunk, and in all honesty this post is already really long in itself. Going off of a tangent right now, so probably should stop.
BH has absolutely no chance of stopping Huskar's farm in a 1v1 situation. You'll be lucky if you even get the opportunity to get last hits yourself, since Huskar zones melee so well with his orb.
I work at a certain 'Scottish' take-out restaurant in a busy shopping centre. Every 2 hours or so, the bins inside the store need to be taken out and emptied using the shopping centre's facilities so that within the store, the rubbish bins don't get too full.   Anyways, 5 minutes before the end of my shift I get asked to run the bins out and empty them (this is a 15 minute job but I didn't mind too much). As I was pushing two very heavy bins out the back door towards the waste emptying station, a customer approached loudly complaining about how filthy the tables were and how I needed to clean the table for her this instant. As I was in the middle of emptying these bins, I apologised to the customer and said I'd get someone out to clean them as soon as possible.   It seems appropriate at this point to mention that although that one particular table was messy (it was messy because the customers daughter had spilled her Coke everywhere) there were at least 3 other sparkling clean tables.   Anyway, I rushed back to the store and told the manager "we've had a customer complaint about the dining and to get it cleaned yada-yada," and then returned to emptying the bins. Once that was done, I come back, clocked-off (10 minutes late) and changed out of my uniform.   Exiting the door from the restaurant into the dining area this same customer approached me, and  yelling at me  informed me that her table was still messy. I apologised and told her to go to the front counter with her complaint before I started walking off. She grabs me by the arm saying, "Don't you walk away from me, you clean this table now!" At this point I turned towards her and told her (not too kindly I must admit) to let go of my arm and see the manager if she had any problems. She huffed and then demanded I tell her my name so she could report me to her superiors. I kindly told her to fuck off and walked away.   The next day, manager comes up laughing saying there's been a customer complaint against someone in the store (knowing full well it's me). He says it's a shame the customer didn't have a name because the complaint will have to be thrown out =D.
OH MY GOD ARE YOU ME?   But seriously, going into my third year doing a Mechanical BE at Waikato next year, and my plan is to work for a year when I graduate then go over to aussie. Starting wage over there is around 80k compared to 45k here.   Plus there are more Trickers (my hobby) overseas, and some of the best are in Brisbane, where I plan to go. Also all my friends are going overseas, and I don't want to be left behind. That being said, I'll probably come back here to raise my kids (when I have them), since I like the climate and the laidback way of life.
I see people every day comment about how these are the perfect light houe mounting solution. Yes they will hold but seeing as the base stations vibrate a little they will slowly wear. It was also said that the lighthouses can survive a good fall. BUT this is an $800 piece of technology,  it may hold for a month or even 6 months but when it falls you're going to regret it. It comes with mounting equipment use it, drill a couple holes in your wall it will be fine. If youre renting and are worries about your deposit dont be. If they dont give you your deposit because a couple of screw holes than they wouldn't anyways. Dont use them, its a temporary solution to a permanent problem.
Here's the thing though.   I had more faith in RVP carrying us last year because he'd actually been at the team and had been a proven goalscorer. For years I'd been saying he had great potential and ability. Unless you never checked it, RVP didn't really improve his goal-game ratio in any significant way last season, he just applied the same ratio to a greater number of games. Also, he'd played way more full seasons than people gave him any credit for.   The problem with Podolski and Giroud and Carzola is that first, there's absolutely no gurantee that anyone of them would take to english football or to arsenal's style immediately(thankfully Carzola has at least), only guesses based on previous play. That's why we needed Song and RVP to at least bridge the gap. The new signings are great but they always needed time to blend in.   Now on Song, he didn't  just  have a breakout year last season, he'd been great for about three. In fact last year was when he did the least defending of his life. Now, there was talk about how he didn't fit into Bould's new system and was agitating for a move, fine, but unlike the planning for a possible RVP move he was just sold. it was a very quick transfer and I even had an argument with my brother about this which I won by showing his that running google analytics on Song to barca stories showed that until like 10 days before the transfer there was no  hint of anything . Not Song to Barca, not Barca for any players, not even an unhappy Song.   We can talk about the merits of Arteta in the new most defensive minded midfielder, a role I think his tactical discipline makes him great for, but if he's ever out who are we looking at?   Diaby? Perennially injured and just recovering from a long term injury.   Wilshere? Just recovering from a long term injury and all the dangers to form and ability that brings with it.   Coquelin? A young untested boy.   So again we're in a situation like last year where we have to rely on what ifs to stand a chance of CL qualification and would most likely require the season of their life from a player to help. We're in a tough spot financially I know, but we can't always go about requiring a negative net transfer outlay and still be relevant.   Right now and for a long time I suspect, the target has just been to stay in touch. We all know the dangers of building a new stadium and the financial restrictions it puts on spending so the plan would have been to do enough to just stay in touch at least and hopefully build on that.   But we're stagnating and being left behind. this is not 4 years ago when there was a big four and qualification was a right from god. Now its way more tougher. We can't just be the worst of the Top Four anymore, we got to make sure that at anytime, we're better than at least  two  teams out of the Top Six.   Now if Kronke can't grasp all that he shouldn't be a Premier League owner. Of course they're more reasons to own a team other than, "I know football dynamics", but his lack of understanding and willingness to accept that is creates a need for a feed back source from  somewhere . That's where the fans come in. If gazidis and the ilk running the club are making long term or short term mistakes, he can't see that, so it'd be up to some whole other group to let him know.   Lastly, might i just state that regardless of what I've written in this post(and this is mainly for other people in general) I never condone  booing  the team. NEVER EVER. You don';t make any situation better by booing.
MEN OF THE WORLD: PLEASE don't just jump into ass play without getting express consent first! My friends and I discussed this recently and we HATE it. Even if she doesn't outright say "no," by just doing it without her consent and then continuing even after she hesitated, you're kind of pressuring her into it. I hate hate hate hate hate when men keep pushing that act. 1) It's a really touchy area/act, so I want to have a lot of trust first, and I want it to be MY decision. Not my "oh he really wants it and I guess it doesn't feel terrible so I might as well acquiesce." I want it to be my choice that's discussed beforehand and respected. 2) Just as important: it has to be the right timing!!! This is NOT the sort of act that's always OK. I want to make sure I feel well, that I've prepped to my own satisfaction, etc.   Also, you're intentionally going after very young women, so they're even less likely to be able/willing to establish boundaries. Older, much more experienced guy they really like wants them to do something and reassures them about it? Chances are they're going to do it whether or not they actually want to.
They are VERY prolife and religious. They believe life begins at conception and abortion is akin to murder basically. Personally, I'm not a big fan of abortions but I am not going to tell anyone what to do with their body.   Now they seem to be interested in voting libertarian due to the other main candidates being just terrible. They really just stayed on the pro choice topic when I said we are socially liberal.   So, what can I do to persuade them to get past this one issue as it seems to be the main hinderence to getting two more votes for Johnson and Weld. I'm open to any type of suggestion. Thanks!
Don't know, the law is that you can't sell alcohol to anyone younger than 19.  It's company and store policy to show id if you appear younger than a certain age.  They can also refuse to sell if they suspect you're purchasing for a minor or if you appear inebriated.  The store is within its rights to refuse service to anyone that refuses to comply with its policies.  I spoke with a manager once because I forgot my id and wanted to pick up some beer.   Rather than make a big stink and get kicked out of the store (it was Christmastime, there were security there, and long lines), the sales person called over the manager and we spoke civilly and she recorded my birthdate and I was able to complete the purchase.    But I agree, its a hassle to always remember to bring id even when walking to the lcbo.
Well of course. He's in the heat of the supposed debate, and opposing something else in here would just put him in the firing line for anyone who drinks or smokes. Obviously he's not the best debater, but still it's understandable that he said that here even if he DID believe that tobacco and alcohol should be illegal. Banning those two "life-bloods" of civilization is a can of worms that no one sane would bring up out of context. Especially in a non-favorable environment such as "being interviewed as an opponent by a bias talk show host." As a doctor, I suspect he is against their use, but regardless
Do you mean guitar melody or chords? The guitar melody will probably be much the same as the vocals if you're writing one. If you're trying to pick out a lick or something learn your scales pretty well because it will help with your geography of the instrument and you won't have to make much of a fuss to play the right notes which makes the process a lot easier. The same can be said for ear training. The quicker you can identify what you're trying to write down the more you can write and keep in your head. Practise singing and playing intervals.   Other than that just learn loads of chords. Start with all the standard ones and listen to how they sound in relation to each other. If you learn a bit of music theory regarding chord structure and progressions this can come along quite quickly. Don't feel like you need to do loads of complicated stuff or be afraid of using the same chords or type of progression over and over again. It's good exercise and many great artists thrive on that (see Death Cab for Cutie) you'll probably just be using the instrument to bulk out the sound of your vocals. After a couple of songs you should start to get used to what things sound like (depending on your musical ear) and you might start to be able to guess what the next chord is by ear. You can also start adding chromaticism and harmonic extensions to found your own sound.   What you can also do is write out the notes of the vocal melody and label every note with all the chords that could go with it and see what kind of interesting progressions you can get. The more different ways you can get the information translated into your brain the more concrete your knowledge and intuition will be.   Sorry if any of this is boring or irrelevant but there were some things I wasn't sure about in your post so I tried to cover everything.   Source: I have been studying music for twelve years and recently taught myself guitar.
So there is a local pizzeria by my old house that me and my fiancé used to go to every once And awhile. They were very overpriced but the food was normally pretty tasty.   We walk in and sit for about ten minutes. I assume they didn't see me so I go up to counter and inform the cook was getting a drink that we are here. Granted there was four other diners so they should have been out there checking the customers orders. So she comes over to our table and right away I can tell this girl isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. She asks what we would like to drink we tell her and as I start ordering she walks away to get the drinks. Comes back and gives them to us and walks away again to get another customer a drink.   After that she returns to our table my fiancé orders the chicken parm and fried ravioli as an appetizer. He also asks for the salad bar. I order ten wings with a side of butter and garlic penne. She looks at me and says ok butte and garlic? I say yes. She leaves to put order in. We wait 35 minutes until we see her again. She has our appetizer. I inform her we asked for ranch. She tells me if we want we can take it from salad bar. The cups are sitting on the table empty. Doesn't offer refill and leaves so quick I can't even ask. Meanwhile the other guests are Also lacking drinks. I see everyone else's food come out and we still waiting for ours. Finally after about 25 minutes she brings the chicken parm and my wings. No pasta. My fiance's chicken is burnt to all hell.   I tell her I ordered pasta and she even said it to me and she is just like ok ill put it in. Ten minutes later she returns with my pasta. I am not normally one to be rude to wait staff but I couldn't help it this time. I tell her, calmly, "I'm not sure if this is your first week or something but I can assure you that this was my worst experience ever. I've been here over an hour and haven't gotten a refill. I paid 2.75 for this drink and not a single refill. Then When the food got  here it was burnt. I mean would you want to eat that? Maybe if it wasn't 15.75 I wouldn't have cared. But you then forgot to put my penne in. I would really appreciate some boxes so that I can just leave. You should understand your paycheck varies on how good if a waitress you are. If you want to make money you should take my advice and work to help your customers enjoy themselves."   She leaves and then comes back and says so would you like refills or not? I couldn't even find words so my fiancé just shakes his head no.   Get my check 45 bucks and they add on a gratuity charge now. Never went there again.
Hi reddit!   If I should post this in r/personalfinance or something, let me know. I kind of don't understand how all these things work.   So a few years ago (it seems...I can't even remember the actual time line for this) my mom suggested we open up a joint checking account. The thing is, I don't even really know anything about it! My mom and dad share an account at a credit union. I have an account there too, which started as one of those Parent-Teen accounts. I use my credit union account. My mom decided she wanted her own bank account and decided to open up one at Citibank a few years ago.   She wanted me to be on the account too and I didn't think much of it at the time (was freshly graduated from high school and didn't know much about the real world). I don't use it. All the money I earn goes into my personal credit union account. Occasionally I'll help my mom pay a bill using our checks or withdraw money from our shared account (I don't even have my own card for it. She will give me hers to use for these instances) but that's all the intreaction I have with it. Now that I'm older, I'm starting to realize I really should not have signed anything unless I understood what was going on. I just signed a paper and that was that! The only thing I know about this account is that I have it. I'm starting to get suspicious because I know now how bad my mom is with money. She has a lot of debt. I know checking accounts don't usually affect your  credit score negatively unless you close them, but I have no idea what the terms and conditions were when we opened this account. I literally just signed A paper and that was it. I don't know how to ask my mom about this without accusing or offending her. Part of me thinks I'm only on the account because she couldn't get one herself with her bad credit (I don't know if that's a thing). Another part of me thinks it might not be a big deal and bringing it up might offend her. I'm also considering going into the bank and explaining how at the time I didn't realize what I was signing and asking what this checking account means for me. I don't want to offend her. She can get offended easily/take things the wrong way. So, I don't want to accuse her of anything.  I just want to know if this may negatively impact my life.
You're not pathetic nor a loser; hell, you set the bar too high and no other man proved good enough.  People do get back with ex-es on occasion (but yeah, it's rare).   Learn to communicate clearly to each other.  You two will need to have some serious "ok, let's talk about what happened" conversations, and "how we're going to make sure this doesn't happen again."  If you don't, you're going to have that nagging worry that she's going to leave again, especially once the new-relationship-energy passion starts winding down and Real Life sets in.   Take it slow, don't jump into things (especially sex), because you need to not just rebuild, but to heal those old wounds.  Go do fun, romantic things.  She needs to do fun, romantic things for you to show you that she's really serious about this (thoughts are good, words are better, actions are best).   If things go well and you feel safe, give her token that she can hold on to: a promise ring, a bracelet, a necklace, whatever; it doesn't have to be expensive, but it should have meaning.  Don't jump into the engagement part just yet (too many feels there), but having some physical symbol of a shared future would be a good thing.  It'll give you both something to hold on to (it will give her a reminder, and you a physical "claim" on her).   Though rationally you can say "I forgive you", it's going to be  really fucking hard  for you to actually do it.  She's basically going to need to throw herself at you, all of her, without reservation or hesitation, and prove to you that she knows she made a mistake and is willing to do anything and everything necessary to have you back in her life... and you need to give her that chance.  Old wounds don't heal quickly, and this is going to take  years  of time, love, and affection to clean out.  You're taking a significant risk with this, but understand fully that  she is too .  Commit to ensuring each other's safety first and foremost, because there will be scary parts.   You can both do it.  This is going to be hard- probably the hardest thing you've ever done, because sometimes it'll be amazingly awesome and sometimes it'll be impossible... but if you both commit to doing your best, well, that's all you can do.
It depends on the emotional situation, certain movies evoke a different sadness.   Toy Story 3 at the end gets me every time, and makes me sad for the end of their friendship, but also knowing that they will always love each other.   Marley & me, the all too real mortality of our beautiful pets who impact our lives so much.   Beaches, lifelong friendship and death.   The notebook, what a beautiful love. Never watch while single or during a rough relationship moment.   The Green mile, the cruelty of humans and also the wonder of them too.   Homeward bound: the incredible journey, something about what those animals go through has me crying all the way through.   What dreams may come, I love this movie. Bur it's heartbreaking.
My best friend left a few weeks ago to a different country, and I realized recently that I have no one here. I have no really close friends, my girlfriend is an ex girlfriend, I'm not interested in dating. All I do now is workout. Yeah, I look better but it means nothing. I'm empty, and I don't know what to do about it. Sorry if this doesn't belong here
Good (insert appropriate time of day for you here)!   What is the role of coaches in LoL? I am/was a professional Halo Coach and I see so much potential for the roles of Coaches in LoL.   I'll explain what I did in Halo and I hope someone can clarify if LoL tournaments allow you to do so.   Basically in game I would stand behind my players and direct traffic. Who gets what power weapon, keep times of all power weapons, decide which path an objective would be ran, kept up morale, and a lot of other Halo specific things!   Out of game I managed diets, sponsorship, spent my time researching teams we would have to play, scheduling scrims, just attempting to take as much stress of off the players as much as I could!   LoL is A LOT more complicated and is also played at a slightly slower pace allowing a coach to actually relay more strats and plays. So my questions for you guys is this!   Are Coaches mic'd in at most tournaments? Are they allowed to directly affect the game (call MIAs, predict ganks, tell the team to get Baron.) Can they communicate to the players? Do teams even have Coaches?   Just small amount of questions for y'all. Coaching is a lot of fun and can be mentally exhausting if you're doing it right. But seeing the reward of a play you just called getting an objective is a great feeling. I hope a lot of players start to pursue that 6th role.   Thank you for your time! Also if anyone needs a Coach.......
I don't want to tell you to do something irresponsible, but when you are young is the time to have fun, make mistakes & learn about life.   Short sob-story, When I was 11, I had 2 paper routes (about 140 papers per day) after school, which netted me about $120 every other week.  Sounds great, but that money went to help pay bills for my household.  My mother worked 2 part time jobs & went to school, so I grew up fast.   Over Christmas, I got well over $500 in tips from customers & my mother let me use that money for myself, & I bought a Cruise guitar & a small Peavey Audition 30 amp, & that's where it started.   I can't tell you the number of bands I've been in over the years.  Some (most) were cover bands, playing for friend's parties or, later on, in bars.  I've had a few original bands & had my share of demos floating around, but nothing ever came of it.  I've also left a few bands because I couldn't commit to it fully, due to a full-time job.   Now my life doesn't completely suck, I have a loving wife of over 14 years & 3 beautiful children (2 boys & my baby girl) that I wouldn't trade for all the fans in the world.
So I was going through the Profaned Capitol and on my way to Yhorm, I see a sign for someone called ChillbroSwaggins. Well, I had to summon a character with a name like that, so I try and I wait. Nothing happens and I take off after I assume it has timed out.   I continued on my way, clearing the majority of the level when I finally get the unable to summon pop up message like 5 minutes later. This was odd, but I just shrugged and finished cleaning up the big room.   I summon a couple sunbros for the gimmick fight, because why not and head on in. [Then out of nowhere, this happens]( Chillbro appears out of nowhere, and I suddenly have 3 phantoms without using the dried finger. By the end of the gfy, you can see my army and Chillbro is there, actively tossing fire and the lack of the dried finger icon.
Lost a very cheap old laptop in a taxi before I actually moved here a year ago. Korean friend was actually on the phone to the taxi company about 2 minutes after we left it. After about 45 minutes we heard back that the driver could not find it, they said someone else in the taxi may have picked up by mistake. It had a sticker on it with contact info for our company and my friend said it had the hotel receipt in the case as well.  It was worth practically nothing (probably 8-10 years old). The only reason we carried it was because we needed a VPN connection on the laptop to access company files. It disappeared never seen again.
Roger Waters is the cultural spokesperson for BDS. BDS targeted the Paris site Batalcan, for its Jewish ownership, which were then attacked the other day. BDS made this place a target and those attackers used that guide. Roger Waters harassed the group, eagles of death metal, who played that day at the Bataclan. Eagles played Israel this summer. The lead singer also publicly said in response to Waters Anti-Israel plea 'I told Roger Waters, 'Fuck you!' If you care about Paris attacks then understand that the month long Israel attacks are connected. BDS is a tool to oppress and has not brought peace. Music should be a tool to bring about good but Waters has ruined his music with his crusade.   Source: [Bataclan BDS target history](   [The fuck you video by Paris Victim](
What changes would you like to see to AC?   My opinion:   I like the direction that AC: Unity is taking the franchise with more of a focus on stealth, but I don't think the franchise is quite where it could be for me. With AC: U they were trying to encourage a "stealth over conflict" type of thing. Which is good, imo, but they could achieve this to a greater extent with some of these ideas(not all of the things I list will directly apply to the "stealth over conflict" type of gameplay, though).     Allow the player to throw dirt/sand/dust into an enemy's face     I know that they have the smoke bombs now, but I think this would be good for smaller one on one encounters, so you don't have to waste a smoke bomb.       Allow the player to drag and hide bodies     I really don't know why this hasn't been brought back(was in AC2/Brotherhood, IIRC). It only makes sense that an assassin could and would do this.       Armor that takes damage over time and needs repairs     (I believe this was also in AC2) I think this would be a great way to encourage stealth over conflict. If the player has a base health, that is much smaller than what their armor allows, it will cause the player to want to conserve their armor and not just pick a fight with 5 guards, knowing that they can just use a health and replenish all of it.       Weapons that take damage over time and need repairs/to be replaced     Pretty much the same thing as the armor before this. Constant usage will cause it to be less effective and eventually break. Needing to be replaced.       The ability to pick up enemy weapons again     I don't understand why this was ever taken out.       A craft system     I think it is convenient that guards specifically carry "phantom blades" and "berserk blades" on them, but I think it would add a lot more depth to the game if the assassin could turn ordinary items into what they need. The stores should be what carry the already assembled items.       Fighting with your hands and the assassin's blade(s) again     I just liked to do this in the older AC games. Maybe they can give your character a boost in speed/quietness for not carrying a weapon, besides the assassin's blade.
So I'm going to tell you you're wrong on the destructible environments, ONLY because I know what kinds of environments you're referring to and what the other guy wants;   Destructible environments in games like Red Faction and Battlefield aren't "random"  debris, the building is set up like Legos and when a part of it is "smashed" the engine recognizes what the closest part is in that Lego set that should fall/break.   What the poster was asking for is a way for the engine to recognize the polygons that clash together, use an algorithm to determine which pieces and clumps should break, and then dynamically produce broken anything. From trees to dirt, all the way to cars to water ripples.
To be fair, I did nazi that coming. I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risk click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. woosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now.
Today is my brothers birthday. He tends to always just beat me down and trash talk me because it makes me feel better. Today my mum and I made brunch for him. We were all enjoying it when he decides to start bringing up how he is doing so well with his life, being a tattoo artist and all, and keeps saying how I'm not going anywhere with my life. I am going somewhere. I'm in school, but got laid off last month and am having trouble finding work. But he keeps saying its my fault. It's not. I'm trying my hardest to do what I can. I had to move back with my mum because I couldn't afford my apartment anymore. I'm 22 but I'm not ashamed of that fact because everyone has struggles. But my brother, who is younger than I, just keeps bashing me for "not going anywhere with my life." I used to have clinical depression but I refused to take medicine because, unbeknownst to the doctor, I was addicted to Xanax for two years and did not want anything to do with pills of any kind. But I struggled and fund ways to battle it without having to deal with taking medicine. I have been smoking trees since I was fifteen but back then it was because I thought it was cool. Now I smoke for other reasons. Battling my depression though has been the hardest thing in my life ever since I lost my best friend when I was fourteen. I've tried to kill myself countless times and failed. I haven't had an urge to harm or kill myself in a year, but my brother knows how to beat me while I'm down. So not even before I was finished, I got up and told my brother I'm tired of his shit and to fuck off. I never curse in front of my mum so I feel ashamed for that, but I felt like I couldn't control myself. I've been sitting inside my room thinking and tearing up, trying to hold back but I couldn't. I cut myself pretty bad. I'm not trying to hurt myself but it helped me feel better. I'm sorry if this is stupid and dumb to be writing, but I have no friends. I used to have a friend but they no longer talk to me because their significant other wont allow them to and changed her number so now I don't know how to reach her. I wish I had more bud so I could smoke and be able to sleep. This is driving me mad. I just thought someone could cheer me up or something. I needed to vent before I did anymore harm to myself.
I was hanging out with two of my buddies at a party, one of which is really homophobic. The other dude is in the military, so he's no stranger to cracking gay jokes at all.   He dares our homophobic friend to grab his dick (the military guy's) for $100. The homophobic friend freaks the fuck out, and says no. So the military guy turns to me. I say yes. Game on. Easiest $100 made in my life.
We've been together 4 months. She's an awesome girl, beautiful smart and very mature.   As background, I've had 3 partners before her and I am her first boyfriend. She's a virgin and is quite reserved (muslim family). I'm fine with this as she has many other qualities I value.   However, it is Ramadan right now and she said she isn't allowed to kiss me or do anything that excites her (ie. be intimate) . I respect this but I'm wondering why I get so bummed out by it?   Am I just a sex focussed maniac? Is it normal to be sad when you can't show affection through physical intimacy? I'm trying to figure out why I get so mopey when hanging out with her and she doesn't let me kiss her (even though we we're having a great time together moments prior).
So apparently there was some event at Ubisoft where Watch Dogs 2 was shown to groups of people. They had to sign an NDA, but anonymity on the internet striked again, one guy came here and shared some things with us. BIG THANKS for that!!!   None of this is official information, so read it and think what you want for yourselves.   (my questions are in italics)   Here's what I know. The main character is named Marcus and this time you are with a group. Yes it does take place in San Francisco. This time it's going to be the people Vs big corporations. One of your team companions is called the wrench he's the strength of the group. In this new game you can climb buildings destroy company buildings and hack smart watches turning them into little bombs that short circuit and shock the hell out of the owner.   Interesting. Anything about online stuff?   We talked about multiplayer and/or co-op similar to grand theft auto 5 or you could just choose which character you want to play instead mission that you're doing its still in very early production we didn't see gameplay.   Very early production? Did they tell you when did they start developing WD2?   It's in production as we speak but they are doing small survey groups nation wide to help bring the game together more and give the gaming community something worth playing. They said a trailer SHOULD be ready by e3 but it's going to be cinematic because gameplay won't be ready yet. They are shooting for a possible November release.   Wow, this is confusing. If they want it to be finished by November then the game should be already in playable state by E3, or even now. I mean are they making everything in the last 4 months??? Should be doing only bugfixes, balancing, etc. in the last few months I think not the core of the game. Do you know if it will be available on all platforms? (PC, PS, XB)   Sorry I was rushing when I replied. The game is already far into development but they want to know what other things they might be able to put in before the final product is ready. It will be out on PC and current consoles.   Did you see this Marcus character? What does he look like (black/white, tall/short, nerd or wiseguy, etc)?   It was all in black and white but from what I can tell Marcus is about medium build wise guy Ish but he's far from a dumb ass and is white. The other three characters are cool as well. The female has multi colored hair and is a bit on the short side she's also white. The other male is short and does parkour not sure on his race he was covered up. The wrench is tall and kind of skinny but strong. I forgot to mention one last thing t-bone returns and has a part in all this I don't know what but he was all over the concept art and the concept trailer. They all kind of have the same style as the characters of infamous second son.   ...
I understand the point of the poll and it's fun as long as it stays tongue and cheek. I know personally I have strong opinions on the AVB sacking but at the same time I know absolutely zero about the behind the scenes stuff so I always get miffed when the masses try to exert their will through polls and what not.
A few weeks ago I was at a party and really hit it off with a mutual friend, who i'll call Sam. Sam and I ended up hooking up that night and both had a great time.   We have a class together and have started talking a whole lot. She asked for my number and texted me first. We've been talking a lot and she's defintly showing signs of interest and acting flirty and whatnot. At this point I thought a relationship would soon start   Today, she told me she "really likes me" but that she doesn't date. She also said that she would really like to hang out soon.   I didn't push for details why she doesnt date, but told her I also really liked her and that (cliche incoming) that she's different from other girls. And that's not a lie, she is far from a typical. After that we went on a walk and talked for like 30 mins. We just talked about random things (college, books, music etc) and both seemed to have a good time. She kept running her hand through my hair also, witch I thought was strange. At the end of the day I wished her luck on her race this weekend and told her to text or call me sometime.   I'm so confused. We've hooked up before, and she's been nothing but flirty and intersted in me sense then, but suddenly she doesn't date. I am really getting mixed signals here! Please help me, /r/relationship_advice.
consistent use in a kitchen   There are kitchens, there are "professional kitchens," and there are "professional sushi kitchens."  Most  professional kitchens will have their knives sharpened on a bi-weekly basis, experiencing more cutting volume on a weekly basis than an avid home cook might see in 4-6+ months. A sushi chef is consistently working with raw, delicate meat requiring precise, clean cuts using knives so hard as to necessitate ceramic to sharpen, hone and polish the blade.   Where a Western knife might be first sharpened on a stone and then honed on a steel -- typically honing with the steel for "extended" periods of time before resorting to sharpening -- maintaining sushi knives is a different practice. The frequency with which this is completed dictates the starting grain and thus stock removal. In some cases the level of stock removal may constitute "honing" vs. "sharpening," regardless in all cases the appearance of any edge maintenance on a sushi knife will closely resemble sharpening any other blade. The difference is that of points on a spectrum rather than any discrete change in process.
I'm about to do a Magic Hat  Number 9 clone , except I will use extract instead of racking onto fresh/frozen/pureed/pasteurized apricots. Taking the yeast out to warm it up, it looks [suspicious](   I can do a mini-starter (mason jar, some x-pale DME, water, etc) with the WLP002, I can pitch it on top of the cake from a Lemon Hefe i did with White Labs Hefeweizen IV (WLP380) that I'll be racking to secondary today, or I can use a jar of washed American Ale yeast (WLP060) that I saved.   Three questions:     Can someone tell me if this is characteristic of dead yeast? The clumps won't stay in solution, and I haven't seen this before.    Is it a terrible idea to pitch on top of the hefe yeast cake? I'm not concerned about 'true to style' (it clearly won't be a wheat beer), I'm wondering what the end effect might be - does this risk resulting in garbage based on the grain bill and using a hefeweizen yeast?   If the tube is dead/questionable, the hefeweizen is a bad idea, should I consider the American Ale yeast? I don't think it'll offer much fruit at all, but the last option is to not brew until my LHBS is open and I can get some more yeast.
The way I fixed it was putting on my snowman mask, going to sp, coming back to mp, taking off the mask and finding that I was bald. I then went to the hair salon and went to my haircut, but I tried my best to skip over the cornrow haircuts. When i got my haircut i just left the salon and it was never a problem.
So I decided to give the Karling Challenge another go. I've done it once before but succeeded mainly because the pope, through a random event, gave Herbert a strong claim on the Kingdom of France. I thought it might be fun to try another path to glory.   Things were going fine, not great; as usual Eudes was a disappointment. I did my best but he still only turned out to be mediocre, and was totally outshone by his sister who had just turned 16. Suddenly I found an opportunity when the recently deposed Prince Phillip (with his appetizing strong, inheritable claim on France) was release from prison and I managed to invite him to court, whereupon I wed him to my daughter post-haste, matrilinealy, of course.   They wasted no time getting down to the nasty and she was discovered to be pregnant only a few weeks later. I thought I was getting yet another incredible stroke of luck. I elected her heir, promptly committed suicide, and started making preparations for my son's inevitable rise to the throne.   Here's where the trouble comes in. Phillip died during my pregnancy, and my son for some reason did NOT inherit his claims, any of them, although I'm especially pissed off about the France claim, obviously. I would just use the console to give him the claim he deserves, but I'm playing on ironman and can't use it.
I was training for a two-week hiking trip in the rockies, and came home with extremely sore legs so I rubbed them down with Ben-Gay.  Since it's such powerful stuff, and I was about to take a shower, I washed my hands a LOT with soap and water to get it off. I then stepped to the toilet and peed.   What followed was the most intense sensation I have ever had.
Agree completely. I put up with abuse from my girlfriend for 2 years! It's incredibly embarrassing to think about but with some people it can happen so gradually! In my case she was great for 6 months and she changed so slowly that I was tied in knots and didn't know how to get out of it. Physical and mental abuse doesn't allow you to think straight.   With these sort of things it's all in your head. After this experience there is no way I will ever allow someone else to assert that kind of control over me. If I could go back and do it over, I would probably go through with it again as it's made me a stronger person and, oddly enough, it's probably made me a better person for it. Silver lining stuff.
I think you're going about this the wrong way. Calling the cops all of the time, especially for small stuff, will result in them starting to ignore you, or at least deprioritizing you. The better thing to do is focus on the politicians through lobbying or even campaigning to get elected yourself. At the very least, try a letter-writing campaign. If the politicians get on board, they can force the cops to start patrolling for the little stuff more and turn the neighborhood around.
Wow. I'm very sorry for you. Maybe you should have started a  freaking 700 page book  a little sooner! I don't even want to think about reading a book like that, ugh! I personally wouldn't listen to the whole thing on audio, because after a while, it just becomes mindless robot voices talking and you don't even absorb anything. If there aren't any questions/homework/papers you have to do with it, then don't read the book. How much left of summer do you have? If you have more than 35 days left, then you can read less than 20 pages a day and read it before school starts.   I had to read three books that totaled to 600, plus another 150 pg one because I didn't read the directions on how to do the project. I will probably be finishing my last book tomorrow, and that means a whole month left of summer vacation without reading another stupid book.
EDIT  On my phone so please excuse any mistakes or shorthand. I am overwhelmed by the responses I received to this post.I want to thank all of you for sharing your personal experiences and advice. I talked with him last night and I expressed everything that had been bothering me,even though I originally didn't want to lay quite everything out on the table. He was very calm and told me he'd work tirelessly on the things he could change. He said he would accept whatever choice I make, but asked if we could at least try some counseling together before I call it quits. I agreed. Am now at my parents' house and I pretty much feel numb. None of this feels real right now. It's really difficult to know if I made the right decision. It's even worse in some ways when he puts we on a pedestal and tells me that he would always wait for me, even when I said he shouldn't. All I want to do is talk to him right now but I don't know if that's healthy for me. I will have to see him for counseling, though, so maybe I can still talk to him? I kind of feel like a shell right now and don't know what to do with myself.   I was quite young when we got together, about 17. We met online and shared a lot of the same interests, and so we met in person. He was really fun to be around with a great sense of humor, even though I didn't feel much attraction for him (not that he is ugly by any means), I went for it.   He is (as you might imagine) my first serious boyfriend.  We went through a few rough patches over the years, but always worked it out. We are very compatible in many ways and resolved most issues easily, although we didn't have many.  We had many adventures -- traveling to SE Asia, Burning Man a few times, road trips, etc.. We have a very special bond and I've basically grown up alongside him. He knows me better than anyone. He's incredibly sweet and loving, has a great job and supports me wholeheartedly while I figure out what kind of career I'd like to pursue.   There are some issues that I don't think would change. I don't mind taking care of household things, especially since I'm not working (going to school), but I think he's been stuck in a childlike mentality. He doesn't get his haircut unless I bug him to do it, he leaves dirty dishes and clothes everywhere, he doesn't like to brush his teeth sometimes on the weekends unless I nag him. I've addressed these issues with him, and he'll make an effort for awhile, but he slides back into old habits after awhile. He's also very much an introvert and a cynicist. He doesn't make friends easily, and holds grudges. I'm much more social and very much an optimist. However, I find that generally I tend to sit home instead of pursuing friendships unless he feels like going out.   I feel like being with him has begun to reinforce just one part of my personality. There is a part of me that likes to sit at home and play video games and gets nervous at large social gatherings. However, I feel like my creative, passionate, nature-loving, extroverted side has been neglected and stifled, although of course not intentionally. Recently (within the last few months), I feel as though the life has been sucked out of me and have dealt with light depression, which is something I've never had issues with before.   I've been trying to just attribute these feelings to my confusion over my career path and not having a goal for the future, but some really painful introspection has made it pretty clear that there's something fundamentally wrong with this relationship.   Recently, his little quirks that I used to find cute have begun to annoy me. I have gone to a few weddings over the past year and just don't see myself standing up there with him. I can't imagine him as a father to my children, even though I haven't decided if I want kids. And still, although he's cute, I've never felt that physical chemistry with him (even though he makes every effort in bed and the sex is good).   I'm crying as I write this because I wanted so badly for it to work. I've been with him for so long and we've grown together. He's a part of me. I love him so much and I can't stand the thought of breaking his heart. He makes me feel beautiful and smart and capable.  I know that it cannot be allowed to affect my decision, but he has few friends and a dysfunctional family, so he would have little to no support system.   I cannot imagine never seeing him again, which is probably what would be necessary if we are both to move on. He's the person that knows me best in the world. I would run to him for comfort, but instead I must run away. It hurts so much that the relationship feels, for the most part, perfect, but there's this nagging feeling that something's not right. That in order to grow and to learn about myself, I can't be with him anymore. But it breaks my heart to hurt him.   And then, there's the logistics of it. I have to split all of our stuff (most of it I'll leave with him since he paid for it, but it will take awhile to sort through). It sounds unbearable right now.
Hi guys, I know probably should be going out with my friends or something instead of feeding you guys stories but there is nothing to do at the moment so I guess I'll pour all my time today into writing. (God knows that I won't get anything done tomorrow because One Piece Chapter 751 comes out and I'm gonna be weebing all over that :D )   Characters   >Me, Lifa, 15 year old girl, 5'10'', Professional Third Wheel.   >Lily, 15, about 6'0'', super beta.   >Skye-Chan, 5'7'', long hair, kind of chubby,braces, real life shipper.   After history class, I just went straight to science class to hopefully find sanctuary from the weeaboo overload that I was currently experiencing. Thank the heavens that I get to have that class with Lily, Ruby and Kayla.   Right after that was the last class of the day, a free period! And we all had the same free period! There were only 10 of us and of that 10 were Skye-Chan and Ada. Ms.Polina was in charge of our free period and since she was one of the cool teachers, she let us do whatever we wanted. And to top it all off we were in the computer lab. free period + Computers = WIN~   >Me: So what should we do for 45 minutes   >Ruby: We can catch up with One Piece if there are any unblocked websites.   >[Tried like 5 anime websites](   >[Lily types in WatchOP.com](   >Kayla:Why didn't I think of that?   >Lily:Whats the latest episode?   >Me: Umm..466 I think   >Lily: So were only 6 episodes behind then.

I'm dating a Japanese girl about a decade younger than myself, who's only had sex twice, both times with me, twice in the pussy and twice in the ass EDIT- on two occassions, vaginal the first time, anal anal vaginal the second time. The ass hurts least, so she asked if next time we can do it there. She was ashamed to ask, but scared crazy of the pain associated with having a big white man's dong busting into her virginal little pudding again. I plan on making it the road most travelled.   She also loves dressing up, and doesn't mind me videotaping our bedroom adventures (I convinced her it will keep me from looking at porn of other women less- and so far, it has worked very well). So, I have a Japanese schoolgirl's uniform and loose/puffy socks on their way, and a pair of proper black steel (not safety release) handcuffs, plus a tripod, and I'm looking for a decent quality mid-range HD video camera around $500USD (about $600NZD in my country).   She's also ok with a bit of anal-play (lollipop insertions, fingering, receiving rim-jobs and other stuff like that) which will make for some fantastic high-def wank-material. By ok, I mean she will moan and make noises of displeasure, but she considers it a fair trade for the multiple orgasms she receives and the dinners, sight-seeing trips, and other stuff. Plus, she knows that getting used to this stuff early will make it easier to impress a guy down the road, with her open-minded attitude.
My girlfriend and I have been dating for basically 5 years, and we're 22(me) and 23(her).  I say basically because there was that time that we broke up in college because I cheated on her, but that's not really the problem at hand.  We live together (with her mom) and have lived together for a while.   Sure, we don't have the best relationship; our time spent together is usually spent on the couch, we don't go out too much, we don't have many friends, and sex is infrequent.  It has been for a while, which I contribute partly to me working third shift, and I wanna do it when I get home, which is when she is walking out the door for work.   Two days ago she said she wanted to take a break, live separately, and basically do other people.  It hit me like a ton of dicks because we've been really busy lately, and I've been looking forward to spending more time with her now that that's over.  She wants to live alone because she never has, and thinks that it will help our relationship.   There are a few things that bug me about this.  First, I feel like she could find someone else.  I know it's unlikely because she just wants independence and some different tail, but it still is eating at me.  Also, I think now more than ever we should talk about it (admittedly not my strong suit).  I think that we should move out of her mom's, get an apartment alone, and work it out.   What was weird was that today when I got home we were talking, then fooling around, and ended up sexing.  Weird but true.
Hello, I am looking for motivated people interested in distributing prescription savings cards to those in need who have little or no insurance. Commission based pay for every paid prescription claim submitted. This could be very lucrative and we are paying $1.00 for every paid claim. The sky is the limit and you can make as much money as you want! Absolutely no out of pocket expense to you. I can set you up with a printable card, with your own specific number to simply hand the pharmacist. If you choose to, you can also have cards printed, but not necessary, as all you need is the group number to get started.  This is the basic idea of the business and how it works.   I have attempted to market via social media, but still need some help.  Anyone have any ideas how I could market this to other healthcare practitioners or people interested?
my gf and I were lying in bed around 3am last night when we heard our upstairs neighbor moaning really loudly. it was going on intermittently for 15 mins or so. I got a slight erection from hearing it, as I can get them from pretty much anything sex related. I don't even know what the girl upstairs looks like.   she asked if I had a boner and reached over and checked. she then got mad at me and moved onto the floor and just sat for awhile.   I told her it was ridiculous and it wasn't intentional.  keep in mind I never have any trouble getting hard for her. I told her to stop sitting on the floor and come back in bed which she did. we both fell asleep and the next morning she continued to be bothered and continued to give me a hard time about it.   is she right to be upset? if so I don't know what to say because I don't feel like my bodily functions are my fault.
A few years ago, as a senior in high school, I did really mischievous shit. I was an honors student, and that helped me cover up the fact that I was a pure school-wide criminal mastermind. This was the time before schools started getting security cameras and such. On the first day of school, they had repainted most of the hallways & replaced all of the fire extinguishers. (I knew this because they had previously been stainless steel and now they were red). My best friend Joe pointed it out & I had the genius idea to steal them all. We had a pretty large high school, almost 3600 kids in it. Second largest high school in the state. We stayed afterschool just wandering the halls. We had a plan that one of us would just take one at a time & bring them out to our car while the other held a door open for us to get back in. We ended up stealing 6. I kept 2, he kept 4. Within a week the school had replaced them all. I have gotten rid of them since then, but one of them actually saved my kitchen going up in flames almost 2 years ago. Don't regret a thing.
Disclaimer: I love TTK. I can't stop playing. Bungie knocked it out of the park in nearly every way. But while with House of Wolves, they introduced something that literally saved Destiny for me and many others and made PvP a full time viable way to play in Trials of Osiris, TTK takes a massive step back and it's sort of killing me at the moment.   In theory, the Crucible quest chain is a great way to ease new players into Crucible. Get into the game modes, learn how to play each, and get rewards and XP for doing so.   In practice, this is just not working. I'll try to organize this into some points, but I need to get the big major problem first right out of the gate:   The weekly PvP bounties from Shaxx and Arclite that are supposed to reward Nightfall level loot to Crucible players are not available until you finish this quest chain     I am a level 40 player. I am nearly at 290 light. My DTR score is in the top 2% of players and in the few months since I started taking PvP seriously I've managed to raise my k/d nearly .3 alone (when you have tens of thousands of kills and deaths, this is not easy by any means). Yet here I am, doing quests that give me level 5 weapons and armor for doing mundane tasks in playlists I don't enjoy. Why am I doing this? To get to the bounties I thought would be there right away.     There are way too many steps to this. Why do I have to play every game mode, and then return to the game modes later to get multiple wins? Why are the Crucible/Factions quests not separate and stackable in order to kill two birds with one stone? It turns what could be a one day ordeal into a literal what, like 14 step quest? At average 10 minutes a game, this is way too long to be doing any of this, considering that you will outlevel all the rewards in the time playing. It's been three days and I'm still trying to get this done while doing PvE content.     It is forcing me, a player who has learned his tastes in playing, into playlists I despise. Get top 3 finishes in Rumble? Fine, ok, no problem, but I fucking  hate  rumble. I really fucking hate it. So here I am slogging through getting matchmade into games I have no hope of getting into the top 3 on in order to get to the next step of this quest.     This isn't account wide, it's per character. TTK has so much to do for multiple characters already but a 14 part quest is just way too much to ask we do two more times, when it's just pointless and not fun in the first place.       And now, for the less selfish observation:     This quest line is just mean to low level players. With no low level or beginner matchmaking, you are throwing new people to the wolves and forcing them to come back when they have gear in order to compete and complete these now irrelevant quests. I deleted my titan last night and decided to hop into Crucible right away to start pecking away at this thing and I realized very quickly; at level 6 I had grey weapons. Regardless of personal skill, the expected level of 5 for the first Control quest is a tad absurd considering this brand new player getting eased into Crucible is going to have to deal with pubstomping fireteams, Last Words, Red Deaths, sniper shotguns, crackshot snipers headshotting them instantly, 8 billion supers, and 10 million other ways to die before they can land a kill with their shit ass stability auto rifle because they didn't know any better to take a scout or the Kvhostov with them. It's meant to ease players in, while I look at my k/d after a typical Rift game and see myself as scaring most people off.      Why am I subjecting myself to all this? I am primarily a PvP player now. I want those weekly bounties that I was so excited for. And after 3 days of PvE I am ready for King's Fall, but still getting level 20 rewards for doing brainless Crucible tasks that mostly rely on the luck of matchmaking if your friends aren't on (and for a brand new low level player, they won't have those fireteams most of us roll with).   What I think is a few changes:     Don't have the Shaxx, Factions, and Arclite chains all be in sequence. Allow them to all be taken at once, so that skilled players are able to complete multiple at once and speed the process along.     Make it so a lot of these steps don't require wins in order to proceed. Save that for the actual weekly bounties, are those are supposed to be a challenge.     Have a grimoire score cutoff for matchmaking in order to let new players not only do these quests but not get shit on by the legions of better geared players. If no one meets the requirements, well, off to the tiger's den with you.  (as of today, 10/22, patch notes showed what they are doing to the quest and they are not doing anything akin to this, but the other two changes I suggested are going in)     Give higher level players who are subjecting themselves to this seemingly never ending quest chain rewards that are relevant, not level 15 greens for winning 5 Elimination (one of the hardest gametypes to win without a fireteam) wins.
Hello!   So I am very new to fountain pens and have been hanging out here to learn more. In reading one or two posts today there was some discussion of nibs, e.g. the Nexus kickstarter post.   It got me wondering - what makes one nib different from another? What make one nib better?   What for instance is the difference between a steel nib and a gold or silver nib? Is a gold nib more flexible, does the ink flow better?   I have seen stuff about flex nibs too, apart from the fancy calligraphy how does nib flex effect the feel of writing?   Also, am I right is assuming that the same nibs can behave very different depending on the bits behind them, the feed and all those bits...sorry if I dont have the right names - its my first day.
Makes me wish either of my grandpas was around.   One of them was in a unit where the medic got killed on the first day so my grandpa used his Boy Scout first aid training to patch guys up. They made HIM the medic after that.   The other grandpa fought in the Battle of the Bulge and came home with PTSD. He was awesome, but would freak out if there were loud noises. He was totally cool, though. Was a race car driver before the war (we have pics), and then came home, moved to South Dakota and was a farmer for the rest of his life up until the day he died.
I have a sometimes crushing social anxiety and an introvert level of over 9,000. I avoid contact with people as much as I can. I became lucky enough to find my soul mate and get married. My wife and a few family members are the only people I feel comfortable around, where I can "be myself".   When I'm in a conversation with someone I am constantly thinking  "What would a normal person say? "  So instead of saying what I really feel, I say what I think people want to hear and am secretly anxious for the conversation to just be over. I just... don't get it. I don't get people.
I'm the older brother. My younger brother been bringing his girlfriend to stay late at my parent house every weekend. My parent really don't like it. The younger brother don't listen to my parent. I been call upon to talk to him.   My biggest issue is myself. I get piss easily when my sibling don't listen to my parent. They done a lot to raise the family up from nothing. I become irate and may yell a lot. I don't care about whatever he's doing, but I need him to stop bringing his girlfriend over. I can foresee myself yelling a lot if he ignore me. How should I approach this issue?
I LOVE the Evil Queen.   Probably 10 years ago, at one point in the day the kids were off playing somewhere and I was just waiting around in Fantasyland.  The Evil Queen was standing there with no one around.  I sidled over to her to say hi and strike up a conversation.  Also, with no one around, I hoped to catch her out of character.  NOPE.   Me: "Hey, how's it going?" She eyes me with distain as if how dare I approach the Queen.  She looks me up and down.  I'm 6'4" and 225lbs.  She switched from disdain to sultry. Evil Queen: "You are quite the specimen. You'd make a fine subject for the Queen." I then go into full pick-up mode and flirt back addressing her as "my Queen."  We're standing next to each other, facing forward and chatting in character.  I was having a blast.  Our backs are to a fence (they were working on what used to be 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea).   Finally one of my kids (my 8yo at the time) starts walking toward me. Evil Queen:  "Is this your spawn?"  I acknowledge that it is.  "Bring her to me."  She then starts chatting with my daughter in the same haughty character.  I ask if I can take a picture of my daughter with the Queen.  "Wouldn't you rather just have my picture?  I'm the better looking one."  I took a picture of just the Queen and then my daughter with the Queen where she gave a great both-arms-out pose hovering over her. Still one of my favorite Disney pics.   She then suggested that my daughter take a picture of the Queen and her newest subject, me.  I handed the camera to my 8yo to go stand next to the queen.  I go to put my arm around her.  "You will not touch The Queen."  Dutifuly, I put my hands by my side.  She, however, reaches behind me, I thought to do the same "hovering" pose, but instead reached behind me and grabbed my ass.  My daughter took the pic.  "Now, be gone with you."  We left.  My favorite Disney memory EVER.
I've been in Cleveland for eight years now, and out of the five different cities I've lived in, it is by far my favorite. Yes, the economy is struggling and the weather this time of the year sucks, but no where else have I found people so friendly and caring, the food is fantastic if you know where to go, and the quirky little neighborhoods are some of the most interesting/unique I've ever been in.
Hey guys, I've decided to make a Fallout 4 Walkthrough series and would like to obviously commentate over the game and just make the video more entertaining and interesting to watch but currently I don't really know what to talk about or how to make it interesting but that is for another time.   For now, I would like advice on how to communicate better. If you guys take a look at my video (The specific part would be from 5.40 onwards)  do you guys notice that breathy voice that comes out when I'm finishing off a sentence or word? I tend to find it annoying but I don't actually know how to fix talking like that.   Would anyone have any tips on how to improve or fix that? I thought it was related to having a blocked nose most of the time but I have started taking some medication to unblock my nose and I still have that effect.   Thanks for your time guys and peace!   P.S. Sorry if this is breaking the rules (Linking to video/channel), but I am genuinely trying to fix my voice.   Edit:
I have an almost 8 month old Chocolate Lab. He is becoming a great dog. However, I sometimes wonder if he is showing behaviors that will make him think he is the pack leader in our home. I would rather break any of bad behavior now, as he is not full grown.   Currently he has to wait to go out side when I say ok, he doesn't go first. Same with coming inside from bathroom breaks, walks, ect. We also make him sit and wait before he gets to drink his water, when we refill his bowl and stays until we say "ok".   What causes me concern is him getting on the couches still and standing on the car console while riding. He knows both behaviors are not allowed. When he is in the living room he will sometimes jump on the couch. He knows this is not allowed. Sometimes I can just say off, other times I just have to walk in his direction and he will jump off. And other times I have to pull him off. While riding in the car he is not allowed to have any paws on the console (basically the storage between the seats, I have a 4 door car) He occasionally fights us and we have to push him into the back seat. I am not sure if he is just testing his limits still as a puppy or is thinking he has free rain over the house.   I asked the vet when he was getting his puppy shots what to do. She said try to lay him on his back. It used to be easy, but with a 70 plus pound puppy, it is more than difficult to get him on his back. He refuses to be layed on his back. (except when he is on his bed with his feet in the air)
Title sounds worse than it actually is. We're both sophomores in college and have known of each other since junior high. Never really talked, though.   My problem is that I am very hung up on this woman, dare I say love. It is, however, unrequited. I tried taking her out a few times... no dice. We stay together like we're a couple. Often mistaken for one on campus. Very often. She's such a flirt around me. I don't understand. I NEVER see her flirt with other guys. She'll pull at my sleeve for attention among other things. She loves to poke me. I've had several relationships before, and she exhibits all the signs of liking me.   She has a boyfriend. They were pretty serious for a while... then it kinda subsided. I don't really know the story as she is reluctant to explain.   I don't know what to do, and it's starting to bother me because I've never had this problem before.   Help reddit....
Even with a large player pool its still likely to get the same people in games if you play in succession.  If after a game 10 people all queue at the exact same time its quite possible that 2 of them could end up paired together for the next game.   When I played league and I would play 3-5 games in a row it was pretty common to get at least one player from the previous game in the new one.
That's not necessarily true.   Height, weight, severity of side effects, and an endless list of other factors determine how your doctor is going to treat you and your medication, that's the entire point of doctors. Otherwise you'd have someone who just takes your height and weight and age and gives you the dosage info you fall into.   72mg can have many different effects on many different factors. 5'2" 110lbs on 72mg could be a dangerous dose that ends in a hospitalization, or it could be the dose that is required to treat the issue.   I pass medication at work and the difference in dosages for my residents is VERY wide. People with blood pressure with a systolic difference of 40 points(150 and 190) both receive the same type and dose of medication and it works on bringing them into a healthy(~120) range. This also can change without any notice which is why we take these pressures daily to watch for changes.
It's kind of ridiculous when sometimes even if you flash while at a considerable distance from Leblanc you still can't escape her chain (E).   I know it's a skillshot so naturally it should be more rewarding to hit than Morgana's ulti but I feel it should be toned down just a little bit or add a range indicator similar to Morgana's ult
Throwaway.  First people to hear this sap story are you guys.   Long backstory short, mom used to be a lawyer, she'd stay up late completely wired from the job.  She started drinking who knows when to help her fall asleep.  She thought it worked, maybe it did at first, I don't know.  This all started before I was born.  She'd get basically blackout drunk every night so that she would be able to fall asleep.  Eventually she quit her job so that she could be more involved with my life, but she couldn't quit the booze.  I'm 15.  When I was around 10 or 11 things started to get serious.  Dad knew all about it but they were both trying to shield me from the reality.  Eventually he went too far, one thing lead to another and he's out of the house for a week on court order.  So I'm somehow alone with an alcoholic who's shitfaced after 6pm nightly for a week.  They end up going to court and my dad's not allowed to sleep in the same room as my mom anymore, everybody's supposed to go to counseling.  I basically said fuck that, my dad basically said fuck that, we both convinced my mom that she was causing all of this with the beer, the wine, the vodka.  We spent the next 2 years convincing the courts that my dad was only ever trying to protect me.  Sometimes she would get physical, mostly it would just be her being drunk.  Ever try to reason with somebody who's shitfaced?  Yeah.  We kept having spats for the next year or so until finally, FINALLY, we get her out of the house for a week.  Her sister came over and we talked things over with the police, one thing lead to another and my mom was put into some inpatient facility.  Ever since then she's really resented my dad, her sister.  She would talk to her sister and her mom regularly about everything, they would put up with her alcoholism (mainly because they couldn't see what was happening to her and when she got really drunk she wouldn't be able to use a phone).  Fast forward to about 3 months ago.  Her sister, my aunt, is around 5 months pregnant.  She makes the executive decision, along with her mother, that they're cutting my mom out of their lives until she gets some help.  Like that'll fucking work, whatever, so that happened.  Mom doesn't mention it for 2 months, suddenly she's crying herself to sleep every night and finally confesses to me what happened.  I told her I had no idea that was happening.  I was lying.  I email my grandma regularly to let her know the little anecdotes from my life, point is we still talked and I knew about everything.   It's been about a month since then.  One day a couple weeks ago my dad said to me, "We can't live like this," after another round of her belligerent behavior, "I'm going to talk to my lawyers again."  I shrugged, didn't think much of it.  Tonight I hear that he's pressing to get to agree to leave the house and basically give him full custody.  I would see her every other weekend and Wednesdays for dinner.  She broke down, but she's been broken since her sister and mom stopped putting up with it.   If you've ever had to be somebody's rock when they're going through a tough time I guess I would equate my situation for the past 3 months to that.  Before, she could go to her mom or sister.  Now she's coming to me, and I see it clear as day why everybody in her life is giving up on her.  She's just an asshole when she's drunk, and she's drunk from 6-7pm until she gets up the next morning.  I see her sober for about 3 hours a day.  It  sucks .  What's worse is, I'm no doctor, but it's like she fried her brains with booze.  She can't remember anything that I tell her, whether she's sober or not.  I'll have the same conversation with her 3 times in 1 day, which pisses me off to no end, and then I'm getting punished by my parent for talking back.   Anyway, tonight, like I said, I find out that dad's pressing for more action to be taken.  She's in tears, and I just said, "I don't care anymore, you two sort out your own problems."  I have usually been sympathetic to her situation because I know the stress she's under from everyone around her to get clean, but in the past month it's been impossible to support her.  Pretty much 1/3 of the time she tries to hold up a conversation with me when she's drunk I can't take it and just tell her to leave me alone.  Then I get the good old, "Get back here, don't tell me to leave you alone, that's it, no electronics, I'm emailing your teachers, I'm talking to your counselors (she doesn't even know who my teachers are half the time she's so gone from reality)."  I told her that I didn't want to hear any more about her problems until she got sober once and for all.  I've given her so many of these ultimatums... everyone has.  "That's it, we aren't going to put up with this, get some help or [fill in the blank]."  I told her that I honestly didn't care if she was out of the house or not because I would rather have her just be drunk somewhere else.  It crushed her but I doubt she'll even remember it tomorrow morning.  She rarely does.  "This breaks my heart, I won't forget this!" Next day she's trying to a conversation that we had ended 3 days before.  Vicious, disgusting, saddening cycle.   Right now all I am concerned about is getting into a college in a few years and getting the fuck out of here.  It's pretty much over for me and her right now the way I see it... If she's out of the house that might honestly be an improvement.  I feel disgusting for thinking that, but I just can't help it at this point.  She says she loves me so much and I believe it, I just can't say it back anymore after all the shit that I've been through because of her fucking liquor... I feel like an asshole of a son.  I'll keep you guys posted I guess... I'll make this my outlet maybe, because I'm not getting a damn shrink to tell me my mom has a problem and that it's OK to have emotions.  Anyway, I'm gonna hit the sack and get back on the grind tomorrow, can't let my grades be affected by the bullshit I have to put up with around here.  Sorry for cursing so much, later, reddit.
Heya! So I'm a very femme girl, and the topic's been coming up on various forums I lurk about lately so I thought I would ask a positive question about it, because I love my femme identity.   Because we're all awesome at the gender-bending, concept-flipping and stereotype-defying, let's take a look at the notion that being really femme is somehow "weak" or passive.   Femmes of AL! What about this identity makes you feel particularly powerful in your life?   Just a few:     I feel like I own my own body in a confident, dramatic way and can express so much of my personality through the way I dress   I feel like I'm very aware when I make the  choice  to let someone take care of me--it takes courage to be so vulnerable   At the same time, I've learnt to really take care of myself because of the assumptions people make about you and the target you can become when you like to dress evocatively, delicately, or dramatically, and when your personality comes across as very "feminine." It's given me a lot more sensitivity towards different identities and about not making those assumptions myself.   I love the feeling that I'm crashing through some queer stereotypes--guess what, world! You can't use my long hair and heels to tell me I can't love women. Because, god, do I love women.
No, but seriously. I'd like to talk about my drunken, hot sauce filled weekend.   So one of my closest friends is moving from Rhode Island to Southern California and we all (our mutual friends, girlfriends, and his family) all got together for the night to wish him and his girlfriend well in their new adventures.   We started off around 3:00 PM drinking about 10 double-vodka jello shots in a race to see who could finish them first. He won, and we then moved on to just hanging out for a while with a couple beers. Eventually, when more friends showed up with more drinks and drink mixers we started going crazy on the ice luge. I lost count of how many shots and I was drunk, but not wasted.   When our group of 5 best buddies were all there, we moved into the kitchen while our girlfriends were in the living room talking about Nick Cage or whatever. Our friend Sean told me to take a shot of Everclear, and lacking any form of judgment, I did and chased it with Sprite. I was mercilessly tortured for using a chaser, so I did what any red, white and blue blooded Murican would do when his manhood is challenged.   DON'T FUCKING DO THIS!   We broke out the Blair's Ultra Death. I didn't take it yet!   I did another shot of Everclear, chased it with a double shot of absolute, and then finished it off with a pizza chip absolutely slathered in Ultra Death. My organs have never been in so much pain. They worshipped me, and by that I mean his dad hit me over the head with his rolled up magazine and called me a fucking idiot.   Immediately, the combination had my entire perception of reality distorted. I remember this because for that moment I felt like I was having an out of body experience. I was Russian drunk, and my face was on fire at the same time.   I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, but the burn would not go away and I was only getting progressively more intoxicated as the alcohol sunk in. I ended up eating a napkin because "I needis illmakeme ferlbegger."   Folks, don't be an idiot. Doing that was a horrible idea because I felt like shit for the rest of the night. Thankfully my girlfriend drove me home and stayed a while to make sure I was okay. I ended up waking up with no hangover but the worst case of flaming diarrhea I've ever had in my life.
There is a difference between taking a kid to the beach where they'll be exposed to something, and directly pointlessly exposing them to something harmful for no reason other than a picture, or worse.   Also I'd imagine any parent who took a kid this young to the beach without proper protection (sunscreen, clothings, etc...) would be in trouble if they let them get seriously burned.
My girlfriend works under a guy who she is friends with. He is older, married, and has kids. He has been sort of a mentor to her, and been very good for her career. He is also a pretty charismatic guy. Not super good looking or anything, but just sort of funny. I have never truly liked the guy because I always though he was very unprofessional with her. He treated her well in terms of the job, but would play hot/cold with her in order to keep her trying to please him. Sometimes he would write critical things about her work performance that basically weren't true, and it felt like he was just trying to manipulate her. That being said, I was appreciative that he was helping her in her career.   So about 3 months ago, he started texting her about work stuff. Which was fine with me, because I saw the texts and they were all work related. But at the end of each text, he would try to talk a little about personal stuff, just a little. At that time, I felt like they were just friends. I've been friends with a boss before, so I know that it's not automatically creepy and I tried to not be the "weird controlling boyfriend" about it.   At the end of one of those exchanges, he texted her a heart emoji, and my girlfriend told him that was inappropriate and said "I know we're friends, but you're still my boss" which I was proud of. She told me about the event and I said "I trust you, but it's none of my business because I don't really understand the dynamic." I've used heart emojis with friends before, but if it weirded her out I trusted her gut instinct while still tentatively saying "He's unprofessional, but if you guys are good friends who knows". After all, I'd seen ALL the text messages they exchanged and my girlfriend was really open about them kind of weirding her out and that she preferred they not happen at all. I told her straight up, just tell him to stop texting you...it's not a big deal. So she said she would, and wrote an email and it stopped for a while   Sometime later, at a company event he got drunk and was touchy with both her and one other girl. He then apologized for it, and my girlfriend yet again said "hey, that was not cool lets try and establish some good boundaries". At that time, my gf didn't really go into specifics about what happened, just that he was being too sappy with her and some other people there. Only later did I find out he was being weird and touchy. I think she was trying to keep me from worrying while still expressing her concerns. I admit now that it was dumb of me to not ask more questions are probe deeper. I guess it was just a sign of how much I trusted her that I didn't flip out about the issue (seeing as it was the second indiscretion). Eventually she felt like I wasn't getting the seriousness so she ACTUALLY told me what happened and then I was pissed but again I was just like "Wow, this dude is so fucked up when hes drunk." Because at that time it sounded like more of a general thing like "Oh he was hitting on a BUNCH of girls when he was wasted, what a scumbag" I didn't realize my gf was being targeted.   Finally, the straw that broke the camels back went down last week. At another after-hours function he striaght up invited her to a hotel room. She said "uh, you're drunk. Goodnight" and that was that. But then the next day he started texting her apologising and finally admitted he had feelings for her AND admitted he wanted to sleep with her. My girlfriend showed me the conversation and t his is where it gets weird...she basically said she knew that he had feelings and felt complicity...like felt like she led him on sort of? And also said "who knows maybe i do have feelings for you in some subconcious way and thats why this keeps happening" or something like that. she also said "I do have feelings for you and I care about you" and she was like...laughing at jokes about him saying he was going to go beat off in the bathroom. She also said that when she had told me about previous attempts to hit on her I said it was "none of my business" which is true...I said that she was the only one who understood the dynamic and that i trusted her to deal with it...to establish boundaries.   When she got home she was crying and made me read the texts. She said "I dont know why i was saying all that because it wasn't really ture, i just felt like i had to diffuse the situation because hes my boss and I didn't know how to deal with everything that was happening. I was so grossed out and betrayed feeling that i just defaulted to jokiness and trying to be understanding and making it not a big deal" She was visibly shaking and crying, I know that she was really fucking confused about everything.   So what I'm asking is this: Do you think its possible that after months and months of a manipulative boss weaseling his way into her mind that the conversation on the plane that IMO dances along the edge of emotionally cheating on me could be totally false and just said to appease this guy? She swears she had no feelings for him, but that she felt like she deserved the attention she was getting because of something she did...which to me is like...classic victim mentality. And do you think it's possible that she was just like...in shock and not sure how to deal with her boss going from like...friend and mentor to saying "I want to fuck you" over a text message? But on the other hand I'm really scared that it's all just bullshit and that she just felt guilty and needed it off her chest. She was so visibly shaken up though...I'm just so confused Reddit. Any help would be appreciated.
Hi  Im 17 y/o male Turkish High School Stutent. I've seen some bad posts about my country and want to fix it You can ask me anything with comments about Turkey too.   Firstly Turkey is laic.I can say %99 of people are muslim but we respect and accept any other religions and dont force anyone to be muslim or terror.

Third , Mustafa Kemal Atatürk ( RIP ) is our founder and the main reason that i can write a reddit post and live free.He wasnt a dictator he was the greatest leader we ever had. Thanks If You Read
I just finished making my first webpage independent from my cs class and I am very excited about it.  Here .   What do you guys think I can improve, format-wise? Or recommend a better way for doing what I am doing, but still as easy to read for a first-year cs student.   I want to make sure I get the formatting right before I make more webpages.
There was an episode of the Golden Girls where Dorothy had CFS but it wasn't an acceptable thing yet so the doctor laughed at her. She told him off in the end.
The Norse gods wanted to build a wall around Asgard to protect themselves with. They were too lazy to do it themselves so that when a giant offered his services to build the wall for them, in exchange for Freyja's (the goddess of love and fertility) hand in marriage, they accepted. Under the condition that he had to complete the wall within a certain time limit or he wouldn't get Freyja. This the giant accepted if he could have his horse help him, which he could.   That was a mistake, as the horse was crazy strong and the giant was very fast at building the wall, having his horse carry all the stone needed. So the gods hatched a plan. They had loki shapeshift into a mare, and entice the giant's horse away from the construction. This made the giant fail in completing the wall within the given time period so he wouldn't get Freyja.   A few days later Loki returned. Having been raped by the giant's horse he shortly after that gave birth to an eight legged horse, which was named Sleipnir. Odin chose Sleipnir as his personal steed.   I know this has very little to do with "The Avengers" Loki, and even less to do with MLP, but this fanart just reminded me of that story, and I felt like writing a wall of text.
I broke up with my ex 5 years ago. It was an intense and loving relationship of about 3 years, and the break up was extremely messy with a lot of hurt on both sides (and a post-break-up pregnancy & abortion stuck in there for good measure.)   We still get on, in a fragile way, but we don't see each other very much - we live in different cities now. There's still odd feelings on both sides - from my part, I have a lot of affection for him, and also, a lot of unresolved anger. Which is fine; I can deal with it. I  think  it's about the same from his point of view. I get messages from him at 1am sometimes of photos of paintings that look like me and silly stuff like that.   He also has a girlfriend who doesn't like me too much purely because I'm 'the ex'. (I assume, anyway. I've never been anything but lovely to her.)   Anyway, so I've been in a new relationship for the past 4 years and we recently got engaged. My fiancee is amazing. His ex girlfriend previous to me is also amazing! We're all great friends - to the point of even having lived together for a few years. Their friendship is entirely platonic and very close. I'm also very close with her. Can't even tell you how cool this girl is.   So we had casual engagement drinks in our home city last weekend. I really wanted to see my ex and catch up, as well as have him there as he's an important part of me. I'd invited most people via a Facebook event (classy!) but I decided to not do that for my ex, and instead messaged him personally. I said something along the lines of;  "hey, I feel a bit weird asking this, and no pressure at all, but {my fiancee} and I are having drinks in Sydney soon, would really love to see you there! If you do come, that'd be so nice, but if you don't, it's totally okay."   He told me that was an interesting proposition, thanks for the invite, and he would "think about it".   A week before our drinks, he told me he was coming! I was super happy and told him so. My fiancee and he also get on very well (they're very similar) and I also said my fiancee was looking forward to seeing him.   However he never turned up on the night! I was looking out for him until I'd had a LOT of champagne and forgot about it. Then I woke up in the morning feeling a bit put out - a feeling which has increased over the past few days.   Why make the whole thing such a big deal, take 3 weeks to think about it before answering - why even say “Yes I am coming” and then not turn up?   I'd like to be friends! There may be still some tension there but I honestly believe you can forge through that via friendship and focusing on things you do have in common and like about each other. Its so sad to lose someone that you obviously have a connection with and like so much because there was one aspect of your relationship together that didn’t work - the reason I mention my fiancee and his ex, is because still have such a strong friendship now - is my view of how these things work skewed by these two in front of me?   Our mutual friends tell me it was probably his girlfriend having a jealous moment and refusing to let him attend. Regardless, he never messaged me to let me know he couldn't make it. Haven't heard anything.   SO after all that (sorry) question is - am I okay to feel mad? Am I being selfish in wanting some kind of friendship back? Should I mention it or just let sleeping dogs lie? CAN EXES EVER BE FRIENDS?   bleechk, so many emotions.
Hello everyone, I could use some advice. My girlfriend and I (I'm a dude) have amazing sex (long distance relationship, so when we meet up, we're both walking like horseless-cowboys for a few days afterwards), and share a lot of desires and kinks.   It took her ages (2 years) to get comfortable enough to tell me that when she was a teenager, her biggest fantasy was, essentially, to be 'forced' into sex.   She said it was 'forced' and not rape, but admitted that the line is a little hazy. She wanted a man to want her so badly he couldn't do anything but take her there and then. Several times when really steamed up and sharing a fantasy together of her screwing another guy she's mentioned how "forceful" he is.   But I'm having trouble fulfilling this one. I consider myself an extremely non-violent and non-threatening person, I avoid conflict like the devil. I also love this girl more than anything in the world, which all makes it hard for me to really get into character. It's all too easy to slip into the cutesy-couple kind of mindset, even when talking dirty we both get a little shy and revert to it. (I'm a pansy, I know).   Wanna know the punchline? I get a huge kick from this fantasy, both giving and receiving. I regularly fantasise about her being 'at-my-mercy' so to speak, and I'm driven wild by the thought of her taking control and making me pleasure her anyway she wants. I just can't seem to get the mindset going!   Another stumbling block is what I would consider forceful; I often think of things like handcuffs, scarf-ties and such, but she seems pretty uncomfortable around them (bought a set of fluffy bed restraints for Christmas). She does however like it when I hold her wrists above her head when giving me a blowjob.   So yeah, whole raft of issues there. Any advice anyone in a similar position may have would be much appreciated :)
The single most enjoyable game with friends AND the most visceral and genuinely frustrating situations in my entire life. I'm going to vent here. There are many feelings out there like this, but these ones are mine.   I'm sure many of you have researched the exotics and maybe even picked your favorite that you wish you had. I also have made the mistake of doing just this. I've developed a liking for The Last Word and Hawkmoon since I've grown so fond of Hand Cannons. I've been very vocal to my friends about my desire for them for several weeks and I'm sure many of you can guess what happens next.   Once upon a weekly nightfall strike, my friend gets The Last Word, and I'm left with a helmet I couldn't care less about. Fast forward to this week, (the very next week) and another one of my friends gets Hawkmoon. I have never been so frustrated in my entire life. I feel as though there needs to be some type of trading added to Destiny, if not just swapping rewards in the reward screen... good Lord it's too much for words.   Thanks for taking the time to read this and let me vent. Stay strong Guardians.
Prior to the date, I concocted what I conceived of at the time as a "flirtacious prank", but which in hindsight was a very poor idea.   The dinner began relatively well and things seemed to be going alright. So it was time to prank.   I paused in mid-conversation and just started into her eyes for a few seconds. "...what?" she said.   Under the table, I slammed my fist up against the bottom of the table really loudly and I made a sharp gasping sound. She was startled. Meanwhile, in my pocket, I had an open ziplock bag full of ketchup, and I stuck my right hand into it.   Before she could say anything I, in a pained voice, said something like "Oh my god, my testicles just exploded." Then I pulled out my hand and looked at it, acting as if it was blood. I repeated it again, in a panicked voice, going "My testicles just exploded..."   I thought that she'd see it was a flirtacious prank, and maybe be impressed, but to my astonishment she actually believed my testicles exploded. She started to scream! She leaped away from the table!   Everyone was staring. "Somebody call 911! She was shrieking, freaking out.   A waiter ran over, and she told him "His testicles just exploded! They literally exploded!"   "Oh SHIT," I remember the waiter saying, and then he literally fainted. Luckily two of his co-workers caught him.   I couldn't believe what was happening. I was absolutely dumbfounded. Overcome my panic, I just decided to run. I didn't say a word. I just up and bolted. Ran out the door, down the street, ran for a few blocks.   After I finally got home, I sent her a text saying "Lol sorry, testicles didn't really explode. Just a prank, sorry."   But I haven't heard back.
B-X Vapor will be closing either late sunday night (6/7/15) or sometime on monday (6/8/15), depending on the amount of orders we have to do. Shop will open back up the next monday (6/15/15) and we will start fulfilling that tuesday morning, back to normal. Why are we closing for a week? For my birthday last year, my dad got me a ticket to Bonnaroo during the presale. Now this was before I started up my business and I never even imagined having this conflict. It's been a really really tough decision, but all friends and family have basically convinced me I should do it and I agree with them. I've been working my ass off day and night for the past 6 months, it's been a tough journey filled with tons of experience, but for a while my mind/body were hating me when I was working 18-20 hour days haha. Luckily, it's not as stressful anymore since I have 2 employees, but it's still been a  ton  of work. This is the perfect opportunity for me to have a bit of time to have a nice relaxed and stress free mini vacation with lots of friends I haven't seen in ages. I really hate having to close shop for a week, but it's not at the point yet of where it can be ran without me there.   Now, to the good news! Now until tomorrow (6/4) at midnight, B-X Vapor will be having a 15% off sale on all products! If you ordered within the past hour, before the code was up, you will be getting more extras than usual :)   Code:  15off   [link to site](
I don't know if it's a nerf or not.   But what you can do, and what I do for grade 5 bioanalysis samples, is to send your companion on a mission in the level you want, board your ship, then look to see if the mission you want is there.   In Bioanalysis, there's only 2 samples, 3 compounds and an assortment of crafting supply missions. If the mission I want isn't there, I'll send my companion out on some crap mission in the level, board my ship, and if my mission is there when I check, I'll cancel the first mission and send them out on the one I want.   Sorry if that doesn't make sense.
I worked as a martial arts instructor in high school and some of the other people were downright insane. Very talented at martial arts, but BATSHIT CRAZY.   One guy was filling in for the owner, manning the front office, when his girlfriend broke up with him via text message. He locked the office door and ate strawberries and cried for an hour, while looking out the little window that connected the office and the front lobby. I would actually get parents coming to ask me if he was okay, because he just spent the rest of the day trashing the office in his sad state.   Another guy was supposed to be helping the other instructors straighten up around the dojang during our last class, so we could get out early instead of spending an hour cleaning and straightening up at the end, so he offered to take out the trash. I was leading the class of middle schoolers in stretches, and the back door was behind me. I heard him leave for the dumpster, then 10 minutes later I heard the doors banging around like crazy and saw 3 other instructors running back to the locker room area. I let the kids take a water break, and excused myself to the back to see what was wrong. Apparently the genius decided that, even though it was winter, he was going to man up and take the trash out in his uniform rather than bundling up. Since we work barefoot (martial arts) this also meant no shoes. He ran outside to the dumpster without paying attention to where his feet were stepping in the parking lot and a shard of glass went through his foot. As in penetrated the bottom of his foot, and came out the top of his foot. He stumbled back in the door and managed to get in the girls bathroom and stick his foot in the sink, but obviously had to go to the emergency room to get his foot stitched up. To make things better, he was testing for his 3rd degree black belt the next morning, where he was required to break a concrete block with his foot. That he had just put glass through. He actually pulled it off though, broke straight through the block with one kick, then bled all over the floor as his stitches ripped out.
Greetings fellows, I normally wouldn't post something like this here but I have nowhere else to turn since, I have already scoured the internet for a solution, and all doctors I've talked to don't know what's going on. I just need answers, and I figured Eldertrees would know better than Trees since we've been in the game longer.   I have been smoking for several years now and I've never had this problem before until a few months ago. I started having minor pain after I smoked in my groin region. At first, I thought I was just high and it was just a bad time for me, so I stopped for awhile. After I came back, it happened again and a bit worse. I thought maybe it was blue ball, but sexual release didn't help that much. So I took another break.   I thought I was having testicle problems, and I had a hernia surgery, so I thought that might have something to do with it. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and they said it was nothing (I might've pulled a groin muscle, because I had just started longboarding and I went HARD at it, but with exercise and stretching, it should go away). So I waited again, started exercising, eating better, stretching, all around being more active.   I figured the problem was my prostate because I was having trouble initiating urine, weaker stream, dribbling, not completely voiding bladder, and having to go very soon after. And the pain, I believe was coming from, having my bladder not fully empty.   A few days ago I tried just smoking a one-hitter's worth and it happened again, although it wasn't as bad. However, I'm not sure if that's because of the smaller amount or if it's getting better.   Basically, I'm just wondering if anyone has had this problem before and if you have, some knowledge on what it is and what I should do.
My main questions is, how is it that this planet has summers and winters that last many months, and even years in some cases?   From what we can gather from the show and the book, days last about as long as they do on our earth. They have one sun, and one moon like we do. Also, the year is basically the same too. Sansa gets her period around her 13 or 14th name day...basically when most women do. So the planet in the book/show is pretty much identical to our earth. I know that seasons have less to do the distance from the sun, and more with the angle of the earth toward the sun...the earth's vertical wobble.
I've started playing [The World Ends With You]( recently! First things first, [the soundtrack]( is very reminiscent of [the Persona series]( and anything that reminds me of Persona is ++   For those of you who've never heard of the game, TWEWY is about a group of teenagers stuck in a game where they have to complete missions or face erasure (ie. death). The missions themselves are just used as vehicles to demonstrate the characters and their relationships: the endgoals themselves are typically just to kill the boss.   I think what works best with this game is the amount of customization available but it's not your run-of-the-mill "upgrade this weapon, find new armour, change colour of hair" - it is essentially a modern world turned rpg in the most fashionable way possible (something something Persona): instead of armour, you can choose to wear chic/hip clothes (although they don't change on screen  sad face ), you eat food (depending on whether they're healthy/unhealthy, characters may like/not like it), you use pins as weapons and money (to parallel the phenomena taking place in  Shibuya  to better your performance in battles.   And the battles!! They're as crazy and hectic as possible as your control both of your characters (upper/lower screens) using both the D-Pad and the Touch Screen (looks something like this:  While it's a lot of fun, it can run dry quite quickly due to the repetition but the good part is that battles are chosen-at-will, so required battles aside, you can decide to just speed through the game's story.   To give the game some credence, TWEWY is a Square-Enix rpg with character designs by [Tetsuya Nomura]( and currently has one of the [highest Metacritic scores]( for an DS rpg. It's available on the DS, 3DS, IOS and Android. It's also really easy to emulate but if you do emulate, I'd recommend emulating it for a device with touch screen, simply because using the mouse as a stylus for this game will be a huge pain.
Well I found out because my password randomly started changing so I finally got sick of having to recover it. Hotmail and outlook email has a fancy feature you can see all the activity on your account including failed password attempts. So I checked all that and it showed me her city ( I'm out of state for work) and I put 2 and 2 together and changed all my passwords.  Later that day she text me about it and got mad I changed it and said she assumed I knew. Kicker is she has been dating my ex best friend.
In the actual state the gym fighting system is pretty broken, you just need to spam click to take out the pokemon because the AI attacks so slow. Why not make the AI attack speed and dodge rate based on how fast the attacking user interacts?   This way the pokemon with elemental advantage and higher cp will win, making it more fair for everyone and gyms will actually be conquered for a while until someone teams up and makes an attempt. What do you think?
My experience has been that this is a case-by-case situation depending on the individual.   For example:   My buddy shaved his head, and he looked a lot  older .   I then shaved my head, and the result was I looked  15 years younger .
yes but to waist money on a Non -euro player who would just be developing, when we can do that straight from someone in europe. I would only be okay with this if the player to be developed would be exceptional, i think we really have to be careful how we handle our transfers , because it will start a new era of players that will waste milan money on or take the spot of a player that can develop. sorry /rant..
Hi! This is going to be really, really hard for me to write but I absolutely have to get it off my chest as I feel I'm going crazy. I have been with my boyfriend for a little over half a year now, and everything is great! We're very open and honest with each other, I love talking to him, we do everything together and are planning to move in but I don't want to rush it. I have met most of his family and even his close friends, and he is coming with me to meet mine this June.   Now, early on in the relationship things got off to a rocky start. This is my first serious relationship and I wasn't exactly sure how things were going to play out. We spent a lot of time in cars late at night talking about everything, and of course on the subject of his exes, one in specific. I would ask and he would answer, and I was honestly just doing it because I am a naturally curious person.   Also, I'm not sure how weird this may sound, but during the early phases of the relationship he would talk sexually about his exes and sexual experiences, and I enjoyed it as well because all of the dirty talk turned me on to no end! However, that was early on. Now, I am very much in love with him and committed, but from time to time, one of these exes will pop into my head (mostly the one before me whom he was close with) and it will tear me apart to the point where I feel like I need therapy.   Now, this is partially my fault for egging him on with the dirty talk (I honest to God didn't know how badly it would affect me), but also because he compared us a few time, saying things like, "Our relationship is much better than the one I had with her," "I would never sing for her but I sing for you.", etc and it KILLS me.   I lost my virginity to this man and I don't care that he has had women before me, but I just really wish I didn't know about them in such detail. I made a really bad decision and stalked her, which helped me to better imagine their part relationship and drove me insane. Also, it bugs me that he still has little trinkets (rings, a shot glass) from her.   Now, keep in mind that this is all from his past, almost a year before he even met me and he was open enough to share it with me. I feel like my jealous is just skewing my view and making me turn into a crazy girlfriend. We have something so strong and I really want to be with him for a long time, I do love him very much. I have brought up this issue with him before and he tries to calm me down, but I'm scared that if I keep mentioning it it will drive him away. I don't know if its because he's my first, but it just bothers me that he shared something special with someone before me, and I wish I hadn't heard the details.
Whenever I go to the bathroom, my cat yowls at the door until I let him in and while I sit on the toilet, he climbs inside my pants and underwear, curls up and purrs like a motorboat; sometimes looking to me for approval.
I am having a friend from italy come to stay with me for two weeks in september and i has hoping you guys would have some suggestions on where i should taker and what i should show her.  There are the obvious tourist attractions like eureka skydeck and the city but i was wondering if there were any other places to bring her that you wouldnt see anywhere else or you would never think of seeing, im open to suggestions!
I'm introducing a bunch of new players to the hobby, and seeing as they all have strong backgrounds in video games (Skyrim, LoL, Shadows of Mordor, etc.), I was thinking of introducing them to tabletop rpgs with the idea that they were basically playing a video game or MMO, at least initially. The basic idea is that they are all beta testers for a brand new MMO that puts a lot of focus on teaming up and adventuring in a party. They would go on quests and level up fairly easy (much like in an MMO), with the "main story" taking a bit of a backseat to the fostering of good role playing and group dynamics.   I also want to give my players a bit of a lesson in RPG history, so every once in a while there will be "patches" that basically mean that their characters are transplanted into different systems. I'll be sticking to D&D, so we'd start with OD&D, then to B/X (not the full BECMI), then 1e AD&D, and so on (of course, the time spent on 3/3.5 and 4 will be short and trauma-free).   As far as actual story ideas go...well, as I said, the "main" story isn't that important, and I want it to be really sandbox-y (again, which matches the video game feel).   Thoughts?
I have the same opinion. Skyrim appealed to the lowest common denominator.   And honestly, this whole MMO business just fucking pisses me off. They've always said they won't make a multiplayer elder scrolls game. Glad they've stuck to their word? They're doing this for money, and I feel like it's going to ruin the entirety of TES. The whole point of it is existing inside a world, by yourself, doing by-yourself things. It's not fucking World of Warcraft.
This is how this works.   As a society, we no longer lock up and permanently house people in an institution who suffer from these types of conditions and therefore they are allowed to roam around the area freely.   To prevent the public from constant exposure to these antics (i.e. profanity-laced screaming), the police establishes a heavy presence in most areas.   There are a few locations that are purposely free of police presence.  These people tend to congregate in these "police-free" areas to avoid harassment.   You know the location of these areas in your city and so do they.
I think the beating up part was more of a quick deescalation/defense as this guy was literally assaulting the other driver. I think the cops should have been called in as well.
I laugh really hard when my sister tells me her stories of working there for several years at corporate.  What would be total BS at other places is/was just the tip of the iceberg there.  Though, in fairness, douchebag Charlie is not involved in the day to day operations as much anymore.   I interviewed for a job there several months ago, and brought the topic up with the team supervisor and HR critter.  The supervisor was cool with it, and went out of his way to show what he was doing to make things better.  The HR pondscum would have nothing to do with the question, and went on the hard defense.  It was really offended that I might broach the topic of possibly working for the work company in America.  Needless to say, I didn't get the job, and it took them months to fill it.
I can't decide if the deck is really as great and consistent as I think, but the dude comboed out on turn fucking 3 twice in four games in modern, and a turn 2 kill seems quite possible. If this is how its going to be I bet the card gets banned. Turn one goblin guide, turn two dark confidant and lose before turn 3 is the exact kind of shit they are trying to not have in modern.   Here is the list, just so you guys know about it. This seems to me like one of the very best decks in the format all of a sudden, I couldn't even hate it out by removing their entire yard wih Rakdos Charm in response to past in flames.   Pretty much the deck ramps up to an experiment of x=like 7 by turn 4, then plays almost the entire deck by ramping up a ton of mana again and again and casting past in flames and a huge epic experiement each several times, then with a storm count of like 40 they cast 3 grapeshots and then flash them all back just for a super-flashy overkill. The deck is just fucking sick, epic experiment seems pretty much broken in storm decks although maybe the list I saw just had great draws although it didn't seem so.   I got the list and saved it in mws for myself, but I figured I would share it all with you guys so maybe other people will help me keep this deck in check.

I was in your shoes, once. I tried two games of ranked back in the older style of the map (before the current "white" Olympus), and went 1-1. It was terrifying. Arena is where I play 95% of my games, I love it to bits, I've played it to death, resurrected it, then played it to death again.   So when Arena league came out, I obviously wanted to try it. And I did. The important thing is to take that fear of failure... and make it your weapon! >:D I honestly played super passively my first few games. Build up your confidence, bit by bit. If someone rags on you, just remember the good that you did. Rehearse it. Rehearse it again. Make it second nature.
I'm a little new to the SE line but from what I can tell it's more of a lower end enterprise-oriented model, it is designed to better handle 24/7 operation and use in RAID. It will be less likely to have problems with RAID down the line. The WD black on the other hand is a higher end consumer drive, and is among the nicer quality consumer drives out there. Its no surprise the WD blacks performed well for you. In terms of overall speed and quality, they should probably be pretty similar. If data integrity is a big concern for you (which it might be considering the redundancy) I would lean toward the SE line. It's got the enterprise features such as vibration/shock compensation, RAID/error recovery that give it an edge when it comes to data integrity.   Thoughts on other drives: There are also drives out there marketed toward NAS applications (WD Red, Seagate NAS, etc) which seem to be consumer grade drives that borrow a couple enterprise features. I have the 2TB seagate variety in my home NAS as it had good reviews. the WD Reds seem to have suffered from quality issues in the past, which I've more or less seen myself as I work in an enterprise setting. I'd avoid greens altogether, I consider WD Blue as a bare minimum even if I was building a cheapy rig for an elderly relative. On the other end of the spectrum you have the RE line - these are fantastic, reliable, speedy drives meant for heavy workload server environments, but at quite a premium. I'd run REs all day every day if they didn't cost so much.   A final thought - in the business I've seen a lot of people rely on RAID and then act completely shocked when both drives eventually fail, thinking their data was safe forever. Don't be the guy who learns the lessons the hard way: regularly monitor the health of the drives, automated weekly checks if you can, and if there's any data that's  truly  important a copy of it should exist somewhere else.
Dunmer i'd have to say, for one as Bythmark said because of Morrowind and growing up playing in that world for so long and also because of that opening line when you go to Newlands Lodge in Cheydinhal for the first time:   > "This is a Dark Elf bar. Cursing, spitting, and screaming? No problem. Fighting is fine with me, too, only the Guard objects, and they'll fine you or lock you up. Not my call."   I liked that, it made me think that if you aren't from the Vvardenfel homelands you end up being a very down to earth type of Dunmer. On a serious note though they respect their dead vigilantly and thats something I myself believe in personally so it felt right picking Dunmer.
Her and I have been dating for eight months now and it's been a very turbulent eight months. About every other week, she gets upset at something dumb and acts like she wants to end our relationship, wants nothing to do with me and basically points out every little thing she doesn't like about me. Then after this cycle, she tells me she's in love with me, and everything is great for a week, and we repeat the cycle.   When we're in a low, she'll either say something like "I don't believe we are compatible" or she will say something like "I'm not mature enough for a real relationship" or "I think I just want to be single". Then all of the sudden we have a few really good days and she loves me again. Now the things we have been having issues with have been really small things, or bad communication, but this seems to be endless, and I feel on edge like I'm about to lose her every time something goes wrong.   Now, normally I would have called it quits long ago, however we are very good together, have a lot of fun together, tons of similar interests, views and have an otherwise very healthy relationship, and I do believe we are compatible in the long term if this roller coaster doesn't result on her bailing on me. I really love this woman, but I don't know if I'd be happier giving up and moving on or keep trying, and hope that the cycles stop, because I know that I'd be really happy being with her.   What should I do? Having some input from someone would help. There is a ton of things I could add, but I've tried to keep this brief.
If you want, sure.   So I have depression.   I'm also 16. This doesn't bode well when you have basically 4 friends and the person you "love" (I use quotes because love is a strong word lel highschool relationships) might like you back but you are unsure and your parents think you are a genius. I'm not a genius. Also my mom is probably my best friend. She is my life, but she lives/works 700mi away from me. My dad doesn't do shit and I basically have no one in my life to turn to. It's lonely, but I try to stay happy. It isn't easy. Been going through school since 7th grade alone and I'm in 10th now. Probably the only reason I never killed myself was my cats and music. I won't kill myself, but that doesn't stop thoughts. ADD doesn't help either. I take meds and they just make me do school work and read. I wish I wasn't such a fucking zombie, and I am trying, but I'm not that skilled at anything. My friends say I can draw, but I don't think I can. I work all day at school and depression leaves me to sit alone in my room for 7 hours. But who knows? Maybe that girl I like does like me back. Life's full of questions and answers only lead to more.
Hello all. First I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read about some internet strangers problems and possibly offering some advice and/or help.   A little bit of backstory:   I'm in college ~3 hours away from my hometown. I have a child with a crazy ex-girlfriend. I go home about every month or so to see said child and to spend time with my family. My SO does not come with me when I visit home due to a couple of factors:          1) she works first shift 5 or 6 days of the week, and           2) my family is very judgmental and I fear too much interaction with my family will cause them to drive my current SO away, like they have done to girlfriends of the past.   Now to the issue:   My SO and I have been dating and together now for almost a year. When we met, she was a strong, independent woman who didn't let anything bother her, and I loved that about her. I could go about my business and she'd never think anything of it. However, recently, (past 2-ish months) she's become very insecure and un-trusting. She does things such as calling me a liar to my face, and constantly tells me I'm being secretive about my life and that she doesn't know who I am anymore. I've been trying to talk to her about it, and it always ends the same. She clams up and the conversation gets nowhere after she reluctantly tells me that she believes that I'm not lying.   I am honestly not lying to her about anything. I've told her about my child and my crazy ex-girlfriend. I've told her how I try and keep her any my ex separate because I don't want my crazy ex to start (explicative) and ruin what my SO and I have. I've told her about my entire past and constantly let her know what I'm doing when I go home. Yet she still insists that I'm lying to her about what I'm doing and am being secretive about what I'm really doing. Honestly, I don't know how make her see that I'm telling the truth and that I'm not lying or hiding anything from her. I've offered to let her see my phone and emails, but she insists on not looking at them because they would "make her feel worse, because she'd still feel like I'm a liar while breaking my privacy boundaries." What can I do? How can I stop making her feel like I'm being secretive? It's becoming very exhausting having to constantly say the same things over and over and to be constantly questioned about the things I do. Someone, anyone, please give me some good advice.
When I was in england, I suddenly got this impulse to give a homeless man some money, and without realizing it at first I picket up my wallet, gave him $15 and a cigarette. The smile that shined up on his depressed face was unforgettable, he thanked me and explained how few generous people there are in this town and I ended up sitting there for 15 minutes talking about philosophy and the harsh life of having no home. He spoke of how money and drugs had destroyed the lives of his friends and how he had problems with alcoholism, but he was not sad. He said that he had found his enlightenment living on the streets, realizing how money had changed people he knew and that no matter how much money he would win on the lottery, he would never go back to a normal life.   His life story was very interesting and moving in a way, if it wasn't for my friend waiting impatiently 10 feet away, I would've continued to talk to him. I told him I had to go and that he should take care and before I left, he said:   "what's your name?" "Alex" I said, "Alex, my name is Shaun" "Nice to meet you, Shaun. Take care" "you too, you are a good man"   For the rest of the evening I kept thinking "why the hell did I do that?" but I was happy I did.
My "Friend" asked if i had any bud, i said i had about a gram in my car, he asked if he could smoke with me later, i said i couldnt, but maybe another time, and then 2 hours later i got a call to the office. they wanted to search my car. the kid called silent observer on me. now i am suspended, and have to go to a hearing to beg them to not expel me. sorry this is a rant, im just really pissed and depressed and needed to vent.
Throwaway. So I've been with Dave for about 4 years now, good relationship, we communicate well and are very open with each other. Recently we talked about having a threesome with another guy/girl and I'm not sure where to go from here. There's been a lot of talk of it and I think we have some good ground rules set, but I have no idea where to go from here now that we've come this far. I really do want to try it out once and see how it goes, but I'm not sure how to find someone interested. I feel like there are a lot of sketchy websites out there that are scams, craigslist is terrifying, and you can't exactly go around the small town I live in and advertise it. SO I'm wondering if anyone has any advice ideas, how it went for them? Pros/cons to it all? Thanks guys!
That song was actually pretty dope. I loved the guy in the oversized baseball jersey and the bandana paisley shorts and golden Nike dunks. He had those John Lennon circle sunglasses. At first I thought he was wearing a teal bandana under his baseball hat with the brim flipped up. Turns out it was his hair, cut in that classics johnathan Taylor Thomas cut with the part down the middle. Classic 90's haircut. In fact home improvement was filled with classic 90's haircuts.
My boyfriend and I have been dating a little over a month. He's my first boyfriend, although I'm not his first girlfriend. I suffer from depression and a little bit of anxiety and have been seeing a therapist. I haven't told anyone other than my therapist about my depression because my dad has strong opinions against depression.   Being with my bf puts me in a much better mood. I mean, I've always had a bubbly personality, but he makes me actually feel good and fun, other than me just acting like I am (if that makes any sense). When I'm with him, I don't feel depressed, I might go as far to say I feel truly happy when I'm with him, and we always have a good time.   The other night, I found out he had a tumblr. I started nagging him about letting me stalk it. He kept refusing, and then he said if I gave him my reddit name he'd give me his tumble name. I immediately shut him down, which I guess caught him off guard. I post a lot when I'm feeling shitty, and I didn't want him to know the sad, depressed me. I'm worried he won't like me any more if he knows I struggle with suicidal thoughts and that I see a therapist.   He's asked a few times since then, asking whats on here I don't want him seeing. I told him "things" which later turned into "sad things". He sounds genuinely worried for me, but I'm so scared of what he'll think. He'd be the first person other than my therapist that I will have told if I told him.   Should I just let him read it/stalk my reddit or should I tell him about my depression first and then let him read it? Or is our relationship too new and I just shouldn't tell him at all?
I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm a tentative person by nature.  I'm careful and I think things through. I don't dive head first, I dip my toe in 10 times before I jump. Along with that came a general disbelief in the "love at first sight", "head over heels" and "whirlwind romance" ideals, I just simply thought that a good relationship took more time, needed to slowly build a solid foundation to work, you get the idea.   I've been mostly single for a little over a year after a 4.5 year relationship. I've got a busy lifestyle and I'm a single mom, so it was simply a case of "don't seek and you shall not find".  So my last dating experience was with my ex about 5 years ago. I haven't really experienced much of the adult dating world, and don't know what to expect from it.   At work there's this guy (Ill call him "S") that works in a different department from me. I've seen him around the last few years and we are Facebook friends. We both work rotating shifts and found that we were both on a 7 day stretch of midnights at the same time. Midnight sat my job are very slow, and both of us are really only here to respond in the case of an emergency so there can be a lot of downtime. S is 31, has been divorced for a year, and has a child near mine in age.   Long story short, we started talking on the first day of nights, and every day since we had spent 4+ hours of each shift hanging out and taking together, and after the first day we hung out after work as well, went to breakfast, talked more, slept together without physical intercourse, and then started sleeping together with physical intercourse after a few days. We have pretty much spent a LOT of time together in the past 8 days (I'd say the equivalent of 10-12 dates) getting to know each other emotionally and then physically as well.   I love being around this guy, spending time and talking with him. We connect very well, have a lot in common, sex is great and I have fallen for him. Hard. This is very much unlike me. I never thought I'd be the one caught up in something like this, but I feel like I just "know" with this guy, you know? But my personality is starting to kick in and I'm beginning to overthink things. Am I just infatuated? Is he just infatuated? Am I in over my head in thinking that this could develop much further into a very serious relationship? Can whirlwind relationships last? Although we do now have a physical relationship, it is much more than that too.   I'm pretty sure he is serious about me, we've decided to officially date and be exclusive.  He is making plans with me for weekends and weekdays in the future. This weekend he wants to see if we can take our children to the zoo together. Is that normal so quickly? (Though we would structure it more like a play date and limit physical interaction with each other in front of the kids). He wants to go to a dinner with coworkers together as a couple. A couple weekends from now when we will both be child free, he talked about doing a little weekend getaway. After being alone by myself for so long, I feel out of touch with the dating scene. Is all his stuff normal? Is this moving or progressing quicker than a normal adult relationship?   I know I'm typing this very practically and I sound uneasy. It's not that really, I AM crazy about this guy, so much so that it surprises me. It's something I'm not used to. But it's allowing me to overthink about silly things. Is it moving too fast? What is too fast? Meeting kids? Is he using me as a crutch for loneliness? (This is what bothers me the most to be honest - though I don't know why I even think that way).   Since I didn't know him very well before all of this, I did privately ask a trusted coworker who is in his department about him. He didn't say anything that would give me any reason to believe this guy is anything but genuine.
Hey guys,   [Here's a video]( explaining what's going on if you don't want to read. I just wanted to share how respectful Ubisoft has been as of late. Making videos for youtube is essentially my job. The videos I upload pay my bills, rent, and give me a little left over to get food for the month. Usually I live check by check and have to watch money closely, especially at the end of the month. Basically I'm your middle class dude that doesn't have a ton of money. When I saw Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon get leaked I thought to myself, "If I upload a full playthrough of this game a month before release I'll get a ton of views, gain subscribers, and that will help bring in some extra money. How ever, this is a giant risk as ubisoft could easily just put out some copyright strikes and basically close my account. This would easily fuck me over and possibly leave me jobless." I decided, fuck it, it's a large risk for reward but I'll go for it. I uploaded a full playthrough, started getting a decent amount of views. Enough to make the videos trend to the point of getting a ton of "I got a free ipad by going here!" comments. A few weeks later Ubisoft noticed this, but instead of just ruining my account, which they have full rights to do, Ubisoft simply matched third part content on every video of the playthrough except the first video. What does that mean? Basically this does not harm my account. All it does is block those videos from being public. How ever, they intentionally did nothing to the first video of the playthrough. This is a very smart business decision as that's good marketing.
an SSN on it's own cannot be used for identity theft, usually you need 2-3 pieces of PII... which in today's day and age isn't that difficult.   Combine it with sites like this:   and you're asking for trouble...   More importantly, it's those assholes who just want to fuck with someone...  they report it stolen, because they have a gripe with the person, and they're idiots and will most likely end up in jail... but not without first potentially causing grief to someone innocent.
Had a bit of a rough week. Just wanted to use this space to vent a little. I am currently living in Europe and working in a mostly female science research lab (our PIs are both male... but that's for another discussion). I am from the U.S. and went to a pretty liberal college and consider myself to be aware of/passionate about many feminist issues, etc.   But lately I've been hearing things from my female colleagues that just make me uncomfortable. Like "that is such an unmanly thing to do" (referring to men doing yoga) and "if we were going to make everything not sexist and not racist and not homophobic, then we wouldn't have any movies" (referring to my comment about a movie I thought was slightly sexist) and "only hippies don't shave their legs" (I for example currently don't but I wouldn't consider myself a stereotypical "hippie" in the slightest).   Weird thing is, most of them consider themselves to be feminists.   (As an aside, I spoke with someone who studied these things in college and she said that in some countries in Europe, the feminist movement was based on emphasizing the differences between men and women. I don't really know to what extent this helps the situation, but maybe I'm having some form of culture shock?)   I just feel so worn down by comments like that, because they are so completely against what I believe. It also is hard to be surrounded by women older than me, who I would aspire to have as mentors, but I feel that I cannot.   Maybe I am having culture shock coming out of my university, where I purposefully surrounded myself with people who shared my beliefs about these things...   Anyone else have the same experience? How do you deal with not feeling supported in gender equality at the workplace by other women? Is there a difference between feminists in Europe vs. feminists in the US?
So I'm not going to get into any details about my relationship. I can't even tell you why we broke up because the best reason I got was an "I don't know". I recently got out of a long term relationship and had to take some time to myself after so I didn't associate the friends I'd made over the last few years with the ex and use them as a easy way to gain information and have them help me get her back, etc, etc.   I'm in a healthier spot and realizing all things come with an expatriation date and ours was just up. That being said I did attempt to be friends again after a few months. Based on her past behavior with ex's I felt that maybe we could chat every now and then. Keep in touch. But there was this irrational (for her) silence to me. I noticed when trying to get back in touch with friends I had, no one seemed very interested and it was kind of random because these were good people in my book.   Then today the messages started coming in. Various people began messaging me about how they're "... glad I'm gone" and how, "the friendship was for the sake of your ex", etc.   By no means was I an amazingly shining example of a perfection in a relationship, but I did try. All these people I've spent hundreds of dollars on over the years helping out with food, or tickets to shows and events, or making sure they were included in things.  I'm gleaning from these messages that apparently there are more than a few rumors suddenly going on about me and the coldness from people makes more sense.   I guess the
Before you start flaming about classes in general, hear me out.   This thread isn't about the standard format and if it's good or bad, we have enough other threads for that.   If you dislike the idea of new classes in general, I suggest you move on since it's about how they could be put into HS instead of if it's a good idea overall (criticism is welcomed of course)   I've always wanted the remaining official classes (Death Knight, Monk & Demon Hunter) from WoW to be included in HS, but the biggest question was simply: How?   With the introduction of standard, getting a new class into HS isn't so difficult anymore. Of course you need the basic set and the classic set, which isn't the best possible solution, but otherwise, they wouldn't have any. Then they could design an adventure around the new class, giving them "missing" cards and themes from old, yet still in rotation being sets. Right now, that'd include inspire and discover cards.   Finally, release a new expansion with the same amount of class cards as the other classes and the new class is ready for standard in all it's glory. I still wish they'd then release the missing cards later to craft, but I believe the mandatory will play standard (and it's the official format for blizzard tournaments) and though will get all cards needed.
Duddeeeee I'm stuck at the 120lb range and im 17 too I totally felt your pain and I just wanna know how you did it and what mindset you had. Im currently wanting to gain weight but I'm not 100% on everything I should do, should I just manage my calorie intake and work out? Im playing soccer for highschool so I'm running around alot and any advice would be great! Thanks
We have been dating for almost a year and love each other unconditionally. I would do anything for him.   We have an amazing sex life when we are together and I have zero complaints.   We are both self-conscious about our body and have body issues. He tells me I am sexy and beautiful all the time and I believe him but sometimes it's difficult to (I've never been in a relationship before).   I found out he watches porn (such a shocker, I know) and I don't have issues with it so much as it just makes me feel bad about myself. Like when we are having sex, I almost have a subconscious feeling he is thinking about the women he watches porn of.   I inquired to him about it (I've found porn and pictures (thousands) on his laptop before and he felt bad and deleted everything) and then found more videos yesterday. He could tell I was upset so I finally told him and he said he finds me incredibly sexy and I have to realize that or else he wouldn't want to have sex with me so much.   I also discovered he's watched porn while Skyping with me and my heart sank. I just feel like it's disrespectful to watch porn while Skyping with someone. I've asked him while we have Skyped what he's doing and I thought he was looking at pictures of me but now I am not so sure anymore.   Apart of me is just not sure what to believe anymore, like how often he was watched porn while talking to me. Again, the porn doesn't completely bother me, but at the same time it does. It's  always of women or multiple women. For example, we Skyped last Wednesday and I found at least 30 videos from that same time.   Yes, I've watched porn before but not while with him or talking to him on Skype.
I remember reading a creepy post here on reddit stating that if you needed to hide a body, you could just find a pre-dug grave, dig a little bit deeper, then bury your body. The concept is that after the other person's funeral, your body will never be found because it's under someone else's grave. So do you double check the grave holes before putting the casket in?
Jesus fucking christ this sub is full of entitled little shits!   This is really, really simple: games are a business.   This is how business works: if you think you want something enough to pay the asking price for it, you buy it. If you don't then just walk away and get on with your life.   If you value the game without DLC enough to pay the asking price then buy it, otherwise don't and shut the fuck up.   Oh but mommy, I was playing this game I like and I saw someone in it has something that I don't have and now I want it waaaah! Sort yourselves out you little fucks, you have zero say in this shit other than voting with your dollars.
The link you provided gives an excellent summary.  As it says, "...police officers confronting situations that create a danger to themselves or others may ask questions designed to neutralize the threat without first providing a warning of rights."  In other words, if you think that you or the people around you are in danger of being seriously hurt, you can take action to protect yourself before worrying about reading the Miranda warning.   There are some further details that go on to elaborate on when the rule can be applied.  In one case, a man is arrested and found to have a gun holster but no gun.  A police officer arrested him and asked him where the gun was.  In another case, police and multiple suspects got into a gunfight.  One of the men reached for a bag that was later found to contain bombs.  Upon finding these bombs, police officers talked to a suspect and asked if there were other bombs and how to disarm them.   The article analyzes these examples further by explaining a few key patterns in cases where the public safety exception applies.  Basically, the information at hand must relate to an immediate threat to the safety of the cops or the general public.  The other key element is that the information must be provided voluntarily, not coercively.  In other words, you can ask the suspect a question but you can't beat him up to get him to talk.
I recently bought the total war game pack which includes empires, medieval 2, and Rome.  I played them in that order; which is in reverse chronological order of when they came out.  The gameplay on both battle and campaign modes is better Rome than Medieval 2 and both are better than Empires.  I'm completely blown away how much worse Empires is than these other two.  I'm now sure I will not buy Napoleon.  My question is how can this happen?  How can a successful game continue to get more annoying and buggy as each game is released?  Granted Empires campaign map is better looking but that's where it ends; Medieval 2s battle maps I think have more or less the same graphics but it runs way better.  Battle AI in the old games is much nicer, no more horses getting stuck navigating fences, no artillery destroying itself.  I could go on and on....
Both types exist, plus another common type. The "jet" method as you described has been used for many years. Simplified it's a cup of liquid medication with a tube running into the bottom of it from which pressurized gas (usually air or oxygen) is blown to turn the liquid into a mist.   The method /u/ZeMilkman described is a much newer technology, in which the liquid sits on a metal plate with tiny holes in it. When the plate is energized, it vibrates and the liquid is pulled through the holes creating a mist on the other side of the mesh.   There's also ultrasonic wave nebulization, which uses ultrasound waves to vibrate a small element in the liquid, thus creating the mist.
Hi elt,   I'll help you understand why this happens.  Copying, pasting, and slightly editing an explanation from another post of mine.   >Lots of fail from people who don't understand software dev cycles... it's nothing new, users have been complaining about how "slowly" software devs make software since before I ever started programming, mostly because they don't really understand all the work that goes on behind the scenes. From their perspective, at the beginning of the project the features would come in full and fast, and that momentum would gradually slow down as the project progresses. The user then assumes that the developer has lost steam, is being lazy, etc. It's like the users who watch early previews of games that they're excited for and can't figure out why the game isn't being released right away, because as far as they can tell, the game is totally ready! No, the game ISN'T ready, even if it's playable... there is usually a lot more that needs to go on behind the scenes that the user doesn't see.   >For example, corner cases. What is a corner case, you ask? Basically, any time you add a new feature to software, you have to consider how that new feature should interact with every other feature that already exists. Take water, for example. If the only existing feature of the world so far is terrain, then adding water is relatively easy. You only need to consider how the water interacts with the terrain. However, if there are 100 other features in the game (players, fences, torches, sheep, signs, cactus, etc) then you have to consider how water would interact when it comes into contact with all those already existing features. The main functionality of water might be to flow across the terrain, but each additional consequence of how water interacts with the other features of the game is called a "corner case". Basically, the more features are added to the game, the more Mojang has to deal with corner cases, and these things take TIME, people.   >And I haven't even brought up debugging, refactoring, and all the extra work poor Notch has had to go through because his little indie game unexpectedly blew up into something nearly unmanageable... things like, figuring out how to build a company on a small budget ($10 mil isn't as much as you think it is for a project like this, folks... good devs can cost well over $150K a year), figuring out how to keep internet services going despite overwhelming demand, the stress and time drain of added media attention, etc. I suspect that if those complainers were in Notch's shoes, not one of them could do half as good a job as Notch has done.   Does what I'm saying about features make sense?  Basically, each new added software feature increases the difficulty, complexity, and time of all future software features.   In addition to what I said above, most of the folks at Mojang are new and still getting acquainted with the code base and their workflow.  And having such a sudden, such a loud and demanding user base, is no easy thing to manage, either.   Hope that helps clear it up for you.
I'm not sure but i would suggest only 1-3miligrams. I asked a buddy of mine what the threshold dose was when i first tried 5-MeO. he told me 15 mg.   While it was kicking in I looked it up on erowid and realized I had taken a heavy dose. That night alone in my room was a night i'll never forget.   The after glow was cool/chill but i'm a diabetic so missing a meal kind of fucked me over that weekend. i've also heard the tolerance rate can be really high, so a small amount may only work the first time you try it
I stretched up to 6g this morning after sitting at 8g for upwards of 3 months. I've been itching to move up, but haven't been ready, and this morning felt like the day. I was wrong. It pinched a little getting the tapers through, but like a dumbass, I didn't take the warning signs. I managed to get some stainless steel plugs in, and left them for the day, but they felt really tight and irritated.   I just took them out, after a day of tight, uncomfortable ears, and lo and behold, my lobes are  super  pissed at me. They were so tight around the plugs I had to soak them in warm water for a minute just to loosen them enough to get them out, and when I did, it turned out one of them had been bleeding.   My question: what is the best course of action following this mistake? I'm leaving the plugs out, of course, but should I soak them? Massage them? (probably not..) Anything I can do to promote healing? I'm probably going to go back down to 8g, but I'm not sure how long to leave them out before I stick something back in there.   I'm very annoyed with myself about this. Please don't lecture me about proper stretching intervals, techniques or materials, because that won't help. I'd just like to help my ears get better so I can try again in a month or so.
I picked up a case of newport at my local smoke shop and blasted a run of 6 cans, after a complete vac purge for 12+ hours I tried out the product and it had a burnt rubber/plastic taste to it throughout the whole slab..   I figured I may have gotten a piece of my glove into the run and chalked it up as a loss.. I then proceeded to run another "test" batch to see if it was the glove..   I blasted 3 cans, with all new coffee filters, a totally different clamp, and made sure to wear no gloves during the packing and running of the buds and tane, and this batch still had a burnt rubber/plastic taste to it.. The only thing I hadn't changed it the fuel I ran the product with..   So I picked up a new case of butane (colibri this time) and ran some of the same product as I ran the first time (not reran but the same trim/popcorn nug) and there is no rubber/plastic taste what so ever.. Now I've ran with Newport 100's of times prior and this is the only time this has happened to any of my batches.. Not looking for any compensation on anything whatsoever just giving everyone a heads up that there might be some fake/not up to par Newport flying around out there
Good Evening All:   I'm fairly new to /r/nofap but have known about the sub reddit for a few months.  I decided last week (sat 7/28) to give nofap a shot.  Im 9 days now (I'm not sure why it says 11, but it's really 9).   I have been reading others' journies and battles; figured its about time I throw mine out there.  Reading this sub reddit really helped me understand - Hey there really is a problem here.  I have been wasting my life PMOing.   Browsing xhamster, xvideos, videobox, motherless was part of my day.  I had tons of favorites and "go-to" videos.  I knew where everything was.  I knew exact parts of scenes, which to skip over.  I would spend hours on these sites.  Passing out sometimes after a late night session was not out of the norm for me.  Waking up and fapping was a daily chore.  It got to the point where it was causing me to be late for work. I would even drive home just to fap.   When your daily schedule revolved around fapping, theres a problem.  When you choose fapping over friendships, there's a problem.  When you choose fapping over a relationship, there's a problem.   YES /r/nofap - I have a problem.   I have no idea what some of your 90+ day guys are going through,  hopefully I can get there in time.  Im setting goals and hoping /nofap can help me to attain them.     I have been trying the cold shower thing for a few days now.  The hot water valve is not completely off, but its inching closer each time.  Im dreading winter already :(     I also hope to increase confidence.  My self-confidnce was probably -5.  Fapping all the time really didnt force me to put myself out there so to speak.   Speaking to a woman; forget about it.  It was really, really pathetic.     I think I had a mental connection of some sort to fapping vs human interaction.  I haven't had a girl friend in 6 years.  I can tell over the past couple years, as my lonlieness grew, my fapping also increased.  Im hoping by not fapping anymore, it will make it easier for me to interact with the public, maybe build new friendships and even get a girlfriend.     Looking forward to the physical positives too.  Going back to the gym next week for sure.       I have become "the quiet guy" in my small little social circle.  I got a job when I turned 16 and have worked 70+ hours a week non stop for the past 16 years.  I wasted my 20's working hard.  ahh, thats for another subreddit.  Let's just say,  I feel like that whale in the article that has been circulating the net.  He's out there but no other whales can hear him.  That pic of the socially akward penguin comes to mind too.   Obvioulsly the ultimate goal of nofap is personal growth.  I completely understand and am ready to accept the challenge.  I just hope with personal growth other things start to fall into place.   Thanks for reading and good luck on your own journey.  I find the people on this reddit are VERY supportive.  You guys rock!   I apologize for any incorrect grammar or improper spellings.  I know they're in here somewhere.  It's late.
I've heard good things! ;)   Diverging from the main line of thought for a minute.. I need to drink more whisky! 2015 has been incredibly busy on a lot of fronts for me - so far this entire year I've only had one quiet evening to myself to sit down and take notes for reviews. I'd love to open that Caribou Crossing but my Collingwood 21 is about 60% full and don't want to open the CC until the C21 is done... May need y'all to help me kill some of these bottles so I can open new ones!
So last night my wife's Lumia 925 shut off tried a soft reboot, took out the sim, and hard reboot all several times to no avail. So she swapped to her 710 until we could take it to the store. Then I opened up baconit to see the wonderful April fools joke but was too flustered to see the jokes. Now I'm pissed but my phone continues to operate normally. 30 min later my wife's freaking out saying her 710 encountered a fatal error, wonderful I'm done with windows phones for now. Look online to see yeah we got pranked mostly but there goes all the hope for her 925 to start working.
Am I missing something with this argument? You chain of reasoning from Amex loses a major non price perk therefore price competition is going to suffer does not seem correct..   Consider this. Previous, a major reason to get Amex over other credit card companies was it could be used at Costco. This made it less desirable for customers to switch to other credit cards, EVEN IF the other credit cards had better rates, rewards, etc. Now that there is more direct substitution (read: competition), we can expect rates to be BETTER for users of credit cards, as consumer will substitute between them now. It's very similar conceptually to breaking up an inefficient monopoly.
One night about 3am my roommate (Female) Comes in and sits on my(Male)  bed in her panties topless. I'm thinking OK, this could get interesting. So I ask whats up? She responds with mumbles and middle-English noises. Damn she is really drunk. I ask if she needs help or anything. More nonsense words. Then I hear it. It sounds like a little bubbling brook.   Hmm. That's an interesting noise. For some reason I thought it was the air conditioner or something. Then I feel liquid on my legs. Shit. Shit. I Tell her to get up and stop pissing on my bed. She doesn't understand so I drag her out of my room while she is still pissing leaving a Trail of urine. She has a drunk pissing problem a year later I found out she pissed on her boyfriends PC as well as many other places
This subreddit's community is going to garbage so fast. Instead of building each other up and loving sneakers. It's turning into fuck you and the shit I don't have or fuck you and your fake shit.  This subreddit is about sneakers and having a passion for something. Something that makes you happy. Only thing I agree with the new community is the crusty ass Nike socks that don't match at all. Trying to wear those high ass Nike socks with a fire shoe. It's tacky, and lame. You are already white, so that is working against you. The socks neutralize all the coolness you built up for that day. Moving on. I'm sick of all the comments "fake as fk". I think there should be a rule against that. Mainly because there is nothing wrong with a fake shoe. It's a  shoe . This is something made to protect your feet. It's not that serious. If a man wants to rock his replica 11s. Let him. If he legit thinks they're real. Politely tell him they're not. Speaking of reps. Y'all legit check everything. Here is a rule. If it's not a Jordan retro. They're not going to be good replicas of it. You know how much that filtered? Anything that's not a retro Jordan, is going to be very visibly fake. And enough with the freaking canvas vans. Nobody freaking cares about canvas vans. They $30 and extremely mass produced. That's why every vans post without an Arizona can or odd future gets no upvotes. And for fucks sake, stop posting yeezys. Don't post legit checks for yeezys. Because 9/10 they're replicas or they're real and you can't afford it. If you see some yeezys for under 3k. They're replicas. Nobody would sell them for retail. Buy reps and stop being a faggot worried about wearing fake shoes. Nigga you probably got fake shoes and you don't even know it.  Okay I'm done with my rant.
