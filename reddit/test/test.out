 Hackaday measured the extraction speed from a video "about 13 centimeters [..] in five seconds" They later kept on calculating with an extrusion speed of 13cm / second. This makes their whole argumentation simply wrong.

Hackaday's calculation is off by a factor of 10. The "13 centimeters" measured, are actually about 13 millimeters. The pen can extrude filament 5 times faster, requiring 5 times more engery.

 Hackaday made a few mistakes in their calculation of the pen's extrusion speed. They are assuming the pen can extrude filament 5 times faster, requiring 5 times more engery.
A new video shows a pen extruding filament at a rate of 13cm / second. Hackaday calculated the speed by using a video of the same length. Their calculation is off by a factor of 10.
The pen extrudes filament at 13cm / second, which is 5 times faster than they say. The "13 centimeters" measured, are actually about 13 millimeters.

The idea of Neanderthal Homo sapien interbreeding started cropping up in the late 1990s. The key is that this is only along the matrilineal line.
In 2010, 60% of the nucleic DNA from a Neanderthal was extracted. When tested against humans they found they matched against non-African Homo Sapiens about 2.5% more than they matchedagainst Africans.
Neanderthal DNA was sequenced in 2010 and found to be a no match for Homo sapiens. This means that Neanderthals had a common ancestor but accumulated its own mutations independently of Homo sapien. This is basically impossible unless
A study found that Neanderthals had a common ancestor with Homo sapiens. But the key is that this is only along the matrilineal line. This proves that there is no Neanderthal mother.

Neanderthal DNA is not an exact match for Homo sapiens. This means that Neanderthals were not interbreeding with humans. The Neanderthal females and possibly their hybrid female offspring did not ultimately survive long term.

Dried Finger summoned 3 phantoms in one area. Invaded 2 Aldritch faithful and a Dark spirit. Every time a phantom died another took it's place without fail.
The dried finger summons three phantoms at once. The host dies in the battle. The event ends. The player is now out of the game. The post was written to encourage more people to participate in this.
