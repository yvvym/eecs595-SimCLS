I imagine a half-man on my bed ripping off his skin and eating it, four skeletal hands ripping through my skin and breaking my bones off, and a tiny sharp-toothed clown chewing on my hair.   I'm sure (I hope) I can't be the only one! Many of you will have even more terrifying ones, and for some odd reason, I'm curious to read about 'em!
OP is chill and, although he doesn't want others to sin, knows he can't force his opinions, and would hate to do so.   PS: Although I disagree with you, I am SINCERELY glad to have had this discussion. It's done a lot to show me what I believe, and I hope I could show you that not every Christian Conservative White Male is out to get you! You seem like a reasonable fellow, and I hope I've come off as one as well!

Got a big fan that moves lots of air. Many choices of where to put it.

There are two for CPU fans (one in use), and also a point for a Power Fan - I don't know what that's intended to be for. I also don't know why some are four-pin and some are three-pin connectors.

Please fill out a medical power of attorney, and appoint a trusted family member or friend to act on your behalf, in case of a medical emergency where you are unable to communicate. Keep one for yourself, and give one to your agent and one to your doctor. If you don't want your N-relatives involved with making decisions about your life and your body, or even if you don't want them present during visitation, then write it down in the document. It will be honored, and your voice will be heard. It only takes a few minutes, it's extremely low-cost, and does not require lawyers or knowledge of legal jargon. You never know when you might need this form, and it could really save you a lot of drama later on down the road.   EDIT: Thanks for the gold, I really appreciate it! And I'm so glad to see interest in this, it is an important topic to think about. Before I start replying to all the comments, [I wanted to link to another comment in this thread]( that has some additional important information that I did not remember to include in my post. You can revoke your document at any time, if you ever change your mind about anything. And it only goes into effect if a medical professional declares you mentally incapacitated, according to generally accepted healthcare practices. Please read that comment that /u/InbredNoBanjo posted with more information about that.
Tapping and bursting are more accurate for the AK-47, M4A1-S, and M4A4.  Spraying is less accurate for those 3.  Both M4s had their base crouching accuracy worsened, though it only really impacts the first bullet and slow tapping.  Recoil resets faster on all guns for the first few bullets allowing for faster tapping.  Jumping accuracy was accidentally improved for the AK47, M4A1-S, and M4A4.     Feedback   Recoil   I feel like rapid tapping is really effective with these changes, but there's no punishment in place for spamming rapid taps.  In 1.6 rapidly tapping resulted in little recoil but after tapping quickly, the recoil would ramp up harshly if the player abused it too much.  If there is a way to keep the recoil buff it currently has for the first 5 or so bullets, but have it dissipate after that, i feel like this problem would be solved.   Reloading also needs to count as towards decaying recoil time, as firing directly after reloading can result in strange recoil patterns.   Jumping Accuracy   [ See Ideal Solution section](   If this isn't possible, just increase InaccuracyJump for all the guns affected.

Stannis is alive in the show. He sent his sellswords and horses ahead to take the Dreadfort, which is where Melisandre sees Bolton Banners burning. Brienne and Pod will retrieve Theon and Sansa, and along with Stannis go to the Dreadfort. Wrought with rage Ramsay will follow to retrieve his bride and his Reek. Roose's words will come true. With the fortified position of the Dreadfort, Stannis will have the advantage and will be able to beat back a siege from the Bolton forces, just like how he held Storm's End 17 years ago.   Granted, the two biggest weaknesses of this theory are:     Pod did not magically show up and Stannis is actually dead.     The Boltons know the Dreadfort better than Stannis and might have the upper hand in a siege.

went to the pub, smoked a little weed at friend's house and chilled on the sofa having a chat until we sleep.  next thing I know I was 15 minutes away from friends house having no idea how or why I was there.   I personally believe it's related to the substances I took and the fact that I had only had eaten a packet of crisps and a small pasta pot from Tesco the whole day.  I also only slept two hours the night before so I was pretty tired the whole day.   Just need a second opinion on this because I have no idea who to talk to or what to Google.   I appreciate all input.

Circular discussions, involving repeatedly asking "Am I Being Detained/Free to go" are pointless. As soon as the cop fails to positively identify that you ARE being detained (and gives a RAS as opposed to a BS answer), the citizen should just say "Well, if you aren't going to identify a suspicion that is reasonable and based on facts, then I'm not talking to you... good day to you"

Make a new plane, treat the map as you would any texture, and texturize that plane. Put plane slightly above terrain.   Edit: you may be looking for a different approach, which is having that map directly on the terrain. That's simple too: Go to the terrain paint menu, add a new texture (your map) and that's it. If it's the first texture added, it will be applied to the whole terrain. May or may not want to lower the tiling from the default 15 to 1.
Slightly annoyed that a girl interested in me (or at least, my thoughts, not necessarily sexual attraction) asked me a question excitedly via PM exchange, I responded about 24 hours later when I was free and asked one back, and she hasn't got back to me yet. Could be numerous reasons, in a mount of bitterness and anxiety/neediness/frustration I off-handedly said something stupid.  Dad interprets this as I am a full-blown misogynist and never say nice things about women. Argument over it last night. Still unsure whether I am actually a misogynist. I am a bit gutted about this but not as badly as my dad thinks. Of course I love them all to bits.  I have a niece, dammit.   On the plus side, The girl recently up voted/Liked one of my other answers on the forum so I'm guessing she hasn't lost interest entirely, at least as a friend/acquaintance of interest with thoughts and opinions she likes. That's cool with me although I do feel like this is a weird 'limbo' of hot/cold signals.   If he thinks that THIS is a misogynistic response, then I can't imagine what he'll be like if I ever get cheated on.
Forcing myself to speak in my natural voice with strangers really, really helped me, and I think it might help others too

Got back recently with ex. We broke up because she kissed another guy and left me for him. It didn't last. 8 months after that, we get back together. Now she is going on a trip and the guy is gonna be there. In two minds about it.   EDIT: Perhaps I should say that the trip isn't mandatory, but she is very active in her student organization. She hopes to become head of the national organization, as she is currently the head of the local branch. There is gonna be an election on this trip, so if she wants to advance to what she dreams of, she has to go. Which is why her offering not to go is a pretty big sacrifice. And also why I am hesitant with keeping her home.   EDIT 2: Maybe I should also mention that the guy wasn't supposed to be there this year. She told me she was thinking about going on this trip, and I asked her whether or not he would be there. She said no, as he and his girlfriend were going on vacation that week. He had written that in the invitation on Facebook. Thus, I initially said that I had no problem with her going.   However, a week later she told me that he saw he had written on the Facebook-event that he was looking to buy a ticket. I don't know what happened to the vacation, but it was obvious he was going. She showed me all of this on her Facebook, so I know it's true.   EDIT 3 (update, sort of): A lot of people have been discussing whether or not I should stay in this relationship at all. As I've explained in the comments I have a very clear impression that she learned a lesson or two and she knows what's at stake if she fucks it up again.   Anyway, I sat down and talked to her. I told her of my insecurities about her going and my feelings towards her seeing this guy again. I also said I wouldn't force her to stay at home, but I would be having a really hard time if she went. She asked what she could do to make me feel better about the situation, and I told her that I didn't know.   I understand the trip is important to her and that it'd be rough if she didn't get to go. But then she offered me a compromise of sorts. During the trip, they are gonna need three people from outside the organization to help in the bar at the final party, cooking for the meals and helping out in general. I'd even be paid for it. One of them have fallen sick and she said that I could come and help out if I'd be more comfortable being there myself. She had already discussed it with some of the others.   I declined, as I'd feel like I was watching her but I told her I appreciated her doing so much to make me feel at ease. We reached the agreement that I will drive her to the place where they will be staying for the week. I will then visit a friend who lives close by that place (within three kilometers) and spend the week with him. Me and my friend will then join the party at the end of the week, as it is open to friends. On the final day, I will pick her up and we'll drive home together.   I know this doesn't prevent her from doing it again, but it makes me feel a lot more at ease.

Anyone know a confirmed way to unbug the Kraal??
is that it should be in the Carbine class due to barrel length, ammunition type and wide use amongst the Russian armed forces. There is NO reason for it to be in PDW class and it's a wasted opportunity to not let Recons use a weapon specifically designed for them.     Why does the AS have the American optics unlock tree? It's a Russian weapon after all. That seems like the weirdest thing to get wrong with this weapon.     AS used to be a special, nuanced, all purpose weapon in Bf3 that took work to master. The random player would be put off by the tiny mag or any number of odd idiosyncrasies the weapon had, but it was devastating in the hands of a great, sneaky Recon player who knew what they were doing and could burst correctly. Now, in Bf4 it's been reduced to a CQB hip-firing spray gun. Please, fellow Redditors, don't confuse me with a Luddite who's afraid of change; I realise Bf4 is it's own game, but the AS is an odd, specialist assault rifle that should be treated as such, not reduced to the level of just another bullet hose with a high RoF.       /rant   EDIT: Spelling mistake

The history of American football is riddled with teams being sold & relocated.   Source: My ass. Seriously, I just wrote that all from my old knoggin'. If any info is wrong, feel free to correct me.

I am enjoying Quake a lot.   Now onto the question, I noticed that the game features a sound I recognize from Duke Nukem 3D (a game I actually played when young). It's the sound the grenade throwing chainsaw guys do in Quake (or I believe it's them). I don't really remember which ones did it in Duke Nukem 3D.   My question is, how are these games affiliated? I'm pretty sure 3D Realms made Duke Nukem 3D, and Id Software made Quake.
My mother ignored me while she was pregnant with my sister and a little while after. It ruined our relationship, and now I don't want anything to do with her. How can I make her see this?   EDIT : I appreciate the replies, even if some were critical of my decisions. Even though my mind was made up, it was still nice to hear a different side. In any event, I decided to go no contact with my mom while viewing your comments. I sent her this short message as an email and text:   "Mom, I know that the last few years have been difficult for us both as we have tried to adjust to our changing relationship. While I can appreciate the efforts you have made to reconcile with me, I remain unmoved by your calls, texts, emails, gifts, etc. and believe that continuing our relationship is not in either of our best interests, due to reasons I have already explained previously. Accordingly, I have decided that ceasing all communication is the best solution to this problem. I will no longer respond if you contact me, and I will nolonger have any other dealings with you, Sarah (my sister), or Tim. I wish you all the best, but I warn you not to contact me again. If you do, I will explore legal remedies to enforce my wishes. I would also like to ask that you discourage Sarah from trying to contact me when she is older. She is too young to remember me, so I think it would be best if you never mentioned me to her again.   J."

Disliked step-uncle dies; still sad; I don't want to drive 16 total hours/spend more than I can afford on plane tickets to go to his funeral, but wife wants me to support her.   I just want to hear what some of you guys would do if you were in my shoes. Also, any similar experiences would be a great reference.   Update: They decided the have the wake and funeral this Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Both my wife and her family understand that we can not make it due to the mid week scheduling. The reason Wednesday was picked is because of the eldest son who can come home from basic training during that time. We scheduled a later date where we can come visit over a weekend to be with them instead. Thanks for your input guys. I needed someone to tell me I was being a selfish person.

Japan is of absolutely no military threat to China. Anyone that would have you believe otherwise is a brainwashed nationalist. The Japanese military is exceedingly good at defense, specifically anti-submarine and anti-mine. The Chinese military is built for anti-access against the US, primarily to make intervention in Taiwan (or other,  newer  regional conflicts) prohibitively expensive. China continues to build up their military to match the US, but its primary strengths are anti-access. They cannot match the US Navy, but the idea is that they don't have to so long as they can make it expensive--that was, after all, a successful strategy in North Korea and Vietnam.

It's to messy and not in sync, too many colors from too many pictures with non matching backgrounds, either change the theme completely or lower the amount of pictures, get more matching ones, get more appropriate ones (mix new and old and get cool short people like bruce lee as well as historical people) and maybe black and white or some kind of drawn sketch would match even more!   Otherwise you could keep it simple and use some kind of Greek statue, like the thinking man, pondering our dilemma as well as merged in the same banner on the other end you see maybe napoleon or Tom Cruise, that alone will say alot, but either way my main point of this post was what's mentionend above, not thsi pic and I don't have photoshop to show what I mean unfortunatly.   You wan't it clean and a metaphor that's understandable but not overly in your face, for instance if you would write an article about a break in at some company, the wrong image to use would be a picture of a robber, it's to obvious and cheesy but a better image would instead be a broken door, or a clipped fence as it represents a breech of security.

No, it's not how equality is seen by most. It's how a lot of people see the "MRA" idea. They in particular don't associate the "MRA" idea as being for equality. Just the same as how many who would identify as MRAs would say equally uncharitable things about Feminism when in an online environment with like minded MRAs because they don't think Feminists want equality. When people aren't willing to give each other the benefit of the doubt, you get straw men like this on both sides that are then used to further justify these superficial understandings of the other group.

I think most of us can see the appeal, but when we're truly comfortable with who we are, we understand that just as being queer isn't all flowers and rainbows (lol), being straight probably isn't all it's cracked up to be either.
I am forced to "cooperate" with $20/week for some stupid weekly office breakfast or lunch and not sure how to get out of it without pissing the entire office off.   -- Edit/update: I appreciate everyone's replies. After reading all of them, I decided to go up to Ms. Event Planner, give her the cash, and I told her (in the most polite/diplomatic way possible) that I would appreciate it if she could ask me first next time as me and my family live off a budget.   I also went to HR and told her (along the lines of what STARIEN suggested) that as much as I would like to participate in all of the activities, my finances unfortunately do not allow me to spend this much cash every month and that I would appreciate it if she could talk to Ms. Event Planner about first seeing who wants to participate. I also mentioned that others could feel this way too.   Thank you guys so much.

Most men will hold you to a different standard because they're interested in a deeper type of relationship with you than they would be with another man.  This often gets misconstrued as sexism when it's really not.

I would like to have a quicker way of accessing the Power Controls. My suggestion is to implement a way to use a keyboard shortcut to bring up a Power Controls window/box/charm, similar to my quick mock-up:   P.S. I am not set on having the Power Controls charm float in the center of the display. I think it might even be nicer if it was attached to the side of the screen just like all the other charms are. That would definitely make this a lot more cohesive with the rest of the design of Windows 8.   P.P.S. I made a quick reference to the possibility of customizing keyboard shortcuts for Windows. Is this something that is already available? If not, then that will be a secondary feature suggestion that I would like to see.

I gave a guy my number, but after looking him up on Facebook I don't want to go out with him anymore. Should I still give it one date?   Update: I texted him some bs excuse about having personal stuff come up and being too busy with work to meet with new people. He responded well but then said he had a "business opportunity" that he'd like to tell me about sometime. I swear to god this motherfucker was trying to get me into Amway. I really dodged a bullet.

is that Troy doesn't belong in this thread.   I'll give you an example of what does, though: the Hittites. Up until the late 19th century, the "Hittites" or "sons of Heth" mentioned a couple of times in the Hebrew bible were considered to be purely mythical, until textual evidence was found in Anatolia showing that the Bronze Age name of the region was Hatti.   This is probably fairly typical of the kind of thing that the OP is looking for. Isolated references to otherwise unattested peoples, places, and so on are pretty much par for the course in the Bronze Age. Occasionally a new piece of evidence pops up, and when that happens, something that was previously very poorly attested suddenly turns into a pretty trustworthy historical fact.

Our convoluted 1990s outdoor game could have been not completely crap if we had access to smartphones. Would kids today ever use smartphones for something like this though?
if you view the game simply on a mechanical level, I can agree 100%. However I think humans have the ability at least, to buy in more, and become invested in the experience, where genuine emotion, and a certain blurring of the lines can enter into it.   (Just to further the point a little more: there are people who get genuinely scared in video games, and people who laugh at the first type of people as they can't imagine how a game can be scary.  One really can't deny that the other group exists though)

Crit mods are wasted on weapons that don’t already have decent crit stats, Critical hits get ridiculous on headshots, Rifles get the best deals on crits stats both on the base end and the mod end. Getting over 100% Crit Chance does nothing, spend your time/energy/credits on something else.   Followup:     Took some time to see if I couldn’t figure out the breakpoint on critical builds. So, I’m comparing 3 variants, with 6 core mods being Serration, Bane, and the four 90% elemental mods. All mods are assumed maxed. The Variants are:   > Variant A: Point Strike and Vital Sense   > Variant B: Heavy Caliber and one of the 60% nightmare elemental mods.   > Variant C: Both of the 60% nightmare elemental mods   Assuming the weapon has a base physical damage of 1, the damage of each build before crits is as follows:   > Variant A = (1.3)(2.65+(2.65x3.6))=    15.847   > Variant B = (1.3)(4.3+(4.3x4.2))=    29.068   > Variant C= (1.3)(2.65+2.65x4.8)=    19.98   Assuming the weapon has base Crit Chance a and base Crit Damage b, a weapon’s average damage per bullet including crits would be:   > (1-a)(Dmg)+(a x Dmg x b)=Avg Dmg   In Variant A’s Case, the formula is instead   > (1-(2.5 x a))(Dmg)+(2.5 x a x Dmg x 2.2 x b)=Avg Dmg (A)   To compare Build A with Build B and Build C,   > Avg Dmg(A) - Avg Dmg (B) =0   and   > Avg Dmg(A) - Avg Dmg (C) =0.   Thanks to the magic of Wolfram Alpha because I’m lazy, we get the following formulas:   > A vs. B: (58.1085 x a x b)-(10.5575 x a)-13.213 = 0   > A vs. C: (67.1785 x a x b)-(19.6375 x a)-4.133 = 0   But wait! that’s just body shots! What if I want to compare headshotting? The formula gets modified slightly:   > (1-a)(2 x Dmg)+(a x Dmg x b x b x 2)=Avg Dmg   and:   > (1-(2.5 x a))(2 x Dmg)+(2.5 x a x Dmg x 2.2 x b x 2.2 x b x 2)=Avg Dmg (A)   After plugging into Wolfram Alpha:   > A vs. B: (325.377 x a x (b^2)) -(21.115 x a) -26.426 = 0   > A vs. C: (343.537 x a x (b^2))-(39.275 x a)-8.266 = 0   In summary:   With a being base crit chance, and b being base crit multiplier, if the following expressions are positive, it may be worth it to consider a crit build.   > Crit vs Heavy Caliber (Body) : (58.1085 x a x b)-(10.5575 x a)-13.213   > Crit vs Elemental (Body): (67.1785 x a x b)-(19.6375 x a)-4.133   > Crit vs Heavy Caliber (Head):  (325.377 x a x (b^2)) -(21.115 x a) -26.426   > Crit vs Elemental (Head): (343.537 x a x (b^2))-(39.275 x a)-8.266   By these formulas, the Crit Build catches up to the elemental build at 2x|5%, and catches up to the Heavy Caliber Build by 2x|15%.  Disclaimers:  I ignored armor and elemental resistances here cause I'm a lazy SOB. The head formulas ended up useless and only illustrate how ridiculous critical headshot damage is, as it beat the elemental build at 1.5x|2.5% and the Heavy Caliber Build at 1.5x|5%.

Basically what I'm asking is how the hell can I make the fights faster when I get invaded? That one took quite a while to win, and could have easily gone on for an hour if he hadn't screwed up. We were pretty evenly matched, save for his better armour, so it was just a waiting game until someone screwed up badly.   Edit: Oh, and while I'm here I might as well add: How do I tell if a shield blocks magic damage? I've been using the Purple Flame Shield for ages, and it's great (especially with the massive guard break reduction when I upgraded it to +7), but something that blocks magic damage as well would be preferable at this stage. I just got the Rune Shield which claims to do that, but it doesn't seem to be listed on the stats page.

Sometimes it just takes a few extra hours in the library to understand something.  Some classes are easy, some are hard.
Friendship is about quality, not quantity.
Let's have a quick update on everything good that's come out in the last year or two.
Bungie should make their game how they want it. This community gets to much power
The Devils have to win 7 of the next 11 games between now and Christmas. Otherwise they'll likely be too far out of a position to have a reasonable shot at a playoff spot. The critical games are against Toronto, Ottawa, Carolina (2x), Philadelphia, and Washington (2x). If they can't string together at least 5 wins between now and Christmas I think DeBoer will be gone or players will get traded or both.
Having gone from 30mb down/5mb up and 60 ping to 800down/800up 40 ping doesn't fix corner peeking problems. (still get red light as well)
jätä tuo huomiotta, imen kukkoja.
Sexual merriment is not the be-all, end-all, regardless of how we may all love those who try.
Don't panic, play deffensive towards the lategame while using 2x warp prism to harass. get as much tech and gas as u can.   EDIT1 Made text a bit easyer to read and fixed some spelling misstakes, bad english is bad.
Threesome cockblocked by girl on period, good ole' two person sex cockblocked by "Coke dick".   My advice on Cocaine:  It makes girls horny, but if you indulge, don't do to much, or else you won't be able to perform
Have these flasks: Staunching, Seething, Warding, and Grounding. (in order of importance, seething/staunching is debatable, having instant health helps in any situation, but corrupting blood is nearly unkillable without staunching)
you can be on hormones for an eternity and you'll never be to a point where you just  can't  pass as male if you want   EDIT to add: I didn't start HRT when I was 16 or 17 because I was worried that I would start to look too female and my family would say something/stop me (they know the Tea, they just don't like it). That was silly because now 2 years after starting, I have tits for Christ's sake and passing as male still isn't a problem. Should have started way earlier because you can  always  pass as male simply due to the reality of bone structure, etc.
Been there, it sucks. Divorces suck.
I ran a police officer off the road, I was fined $250 from a ticket mailed to me.
I'm an idiot, was caught and had an extremely embarrassing and awful 420. I would like to hear some similar stories from you guys to make me feel a bit less like a piece of shit.   Edit:  I feel like I'm saying this in response to everybody but thank you so much, my fellow ents. Please keep your wonderful responses up, because hearing and speaking to all of you has already helped me immeasurably. You are truly an amazing bunch of people.   Yet another edit: I have just finished e-mailing norml. I've spoken with both my parents and my older sister. They are furious that I was treated like this just for smoking a joint. They're going shell out as much money as needed to get me a good lawyer. My sister and my mother will be flying out to Iowa for my hearing. My sister and my dad want me to reconsider going to college in Iowa, so I may transfer to a different college back home in Massachusetts five weeks from now at the end of this academic year.
Ran into 3 players on experimental 50 player servers. No one at NWAF though
gap armour and hence triforcing is intuitive.
got a tiny bead stuck up my nose, snorked it in, went down my throat, scarred me for life
people refusing to read articles and choosing to believe hearsay. Same people also constantly giving me grief about my new habit.
My exboyfriend of three years and my best friend of five years' exgirlfriend of a year and a half are whores with no morals. And alcohol ruins lives.
My soulmate broke up with me, I wish him the best, I want him to be happy, with or without me. But I feel like I can't breathe.
Philly sport fans are fucking retarded.
We are going to host a tournament for CS 1.6 and also CS:S like the good old days. We are doing an interest check, please answer:
PAYBACK IS A BITCH
my cousin tried to start the second cold war.
Each auto reduces ward duration by 1 minute if it is not killed before it goes invisible.
Shut up and read it all, it's useful :)   I hope you find this all useful! This is the most fun role in league, but also the most difficult. Don't be hard on yourself, cause you're gonna make some  really  bad calls. Have your team keep it cool, and discuss it after. Good luck!
I got cheated on by my first love "by accident" when I was 15, which was devastating and confusing, since he really truly is a sincere and good guy that cared about me, if not loved me, a lot. He broke it off for my sake, but we eventually gave it a second chance. One day I woke up and just knew it had to be over - it was driving me crazy.
Everything you believe is mostly wrong and will likely get you arrested.
His OP but really unreliable.
Based" means that you don't need anyone's help and you can take care of yourself, basically.
Met a girl at a wedding, she lives 800 miles away, always seems like she enjoys talking to me, but I’m always the one who initiates the texts and calls.
Should I buy a sealed box of Commander 2013 for $116.64?
Is there an official rule for Medicine checks out of combat, or do you just handle it from a story perspective?
Man up and read it, it ain't that long!
Opera is totally a drug. But It's one you should want to be hooked on.
My best friend was diagnosed with HIV and I'm looking for ways to help.
My thoughts on Oreimo. Feel free to post what you thought about the series and its ending.
i've been with my omni boyfriend for almost 6 months now. respect is a huge thing, and his willingness to try out the lifestyle later on when we get our own place is a major bonus. :)
My mom came home when I was smoking with friends. Gave a shit at first, but then ended up not at all.
Boyfriend drunkenly said he still loved me and thought our break up was a mistake. I'm confused on how to move forward?
How do I kill specific dropped item entities?
I watched Saw on acid with an 8 year old kid
DO NOT USE THESE, piles of shit.
My question is basically: How do I design the best NFC PCB antenna with 30x18mm space?
Love the hobby; hate the tinkering.  Who can do it for me?
OP is whining about not living all by his lonesome because his finances are fucked.   I'm 30 in Ohio.
I played the nightly beta after two montsh of no starbound and I'm greeted with nice new additions and just a couple small beta-excused annoyances.
of it is that we think we can work with this kind of player.
Check all doors before stripping down to your tighty whiteys.
avoid being set on fire.   Edit: At number 6: Pulled three muscles in my back, since the muscles wrap around the side to the front, it put a bunch of pressure on my lung, I suddenly couldn't breath, and almost blacked out (was doing groundfighting in a martial arts class, fortunately my opponent noticed me go completely limp.)
Don't give your shady friend/roommate permission to drive your car, ever.
Invisible knife stabs my cervix and drags down.. Why?!
bitchy girl's dad cheats with mentally challenged girl's mom so bitchy girl lashes out by writing death threats to that girl.
boo fucking hoo the cops didn't give a shit about a drunk guy throwing bottles at your house - it's a nothing crime. Burglary is serious.
Tried to be less afraid of sex and sharing sexual intimacy with my partners.  Got a horrible infection with two  permanent STDs.  No more sex for me.
You didn't hurt them
Never assume an alarm can be a false alarm.   Authorities should never blame a false alarm treated as real.   In this society we are encouraged (through laws and other ways) to take the lazy and easy choice of not taking action, of waiting for someone with higher authority.   This can lead in the long run to a mentality that brings to a totalitarian state (I just follow orders/I am not responsible of my actions or lack of)
Hit goal weight, stopped doing keto, ate crappy foods, still losing weight and feeling full. Why?
Should I meet my Ex for a walk and talk / drink?
I’m upset about how much time we spent shooting each other down in this subreddit, could we please try harder to assume goodwill on the part of others?
Meet friend's cousin   Would like to talk to her/hang out with her   Friend says he has no problem, but this contradicts conversations that were had regarding other close friend's cousins in the past.   Also hesitant because I'm pretty close with his immediate family.     Any thoughts?
Guinea pigs are pure evil.
Tipping the $3.50 and mind-fucking the waiter is much more satisfying than saving a couple bucks.  Stiffing will come around to get you in the end.  Having the manager deal with them is best for you and the restaurant.
Stop calling science the truth, because it's not, it's only the most rational explanation at the current time. Also check the youtube link for an interesting explanation on how science works.

New version of old song by band I just joined up with, check it out, tell me what you think.   [BOTTOM (reborn) - 2012](
WetVapes has great customer service. Shop there.
People starve because of institutions, or the lack of it. And call them low-income countries. We only have one world, you know.
got carpal tunnel and can't play for awhile, let me know if you want the instructions to my rehab exercises.   EDIT: Exercises are here,   Page 1   Page 2   Also, if someone could tell me how to make links on here, that'd be awesome.
Mulayam is the true problem here, a bastard who is making the worst issues a ballot-boat. We as Indians need to see what sections of our society are becoming, where less punishment for rape strikes a chord as a vote-driving issue.
Neighbor erected a poorly built fence and massively damaged mine by anchoring it to it.  He attempted to call the 8 inches of my property his fence covered as his and it took going to court, police suggestion, to rectify the situation.
Broke my friends skullcandy headphones almost 2 years ago, let her borrow my pair of skullcandies until I bought her a new pair, have yet to do so even though I've had enough money to do so on multiple occasions. Am I Scumbag Steve?   edit accidentally a word.
Take a minute to think about supporting your club and how it affects how you watch and enjoy the sport.
NMom disrespects my identity, I (metaphorically) slap her in the face with truths she can't handle. Over 9000 lols ensue.   I'm not looking for support or answers here. Just sharing this gem of a story. Hopefully it makes you laugh or inspires you to quit silently taking your Nparent(s') shit.
My boyfriend's younger sister hates me and has decided to stop pretending that she doesn't. I believe she will do everything she can think of to try and break us up.   Edit: So she has his phone still and has just posted photos of him passed out on the ground at the party with duvets and other people's vomit (I found out from a mutual friend at the party who I contacted that the vomit isn't his) around him.  He has told her numerous times to not post on/ use his Facebook as he has important people on there, including people who will be his bosses in the medical industry (he is studying medicine), who he wants to maintain a professional image around.
If you wanna learn a champion's kit, that's about the extent of ARAM's benefit. Otherwise you're going to end up with an ARAM (read: yolo) mindset in a more strategy focused game type. Stick to normals and spam a champion if you want to practice mechanics without losing ELO!
Me crying and whining to you guys while being desperate and having no idea why this occurs and what to do.
card got stolen and money was taken out on it afterwards, any way to claim it back?   Edit: Thanks to everyone who helped, I've talked to the bank and I'm getting the money back into my account! I'm gonna be a lot more careful from now on with my card, and I'm not going to bring it out when I'm drinking anymore
Cereal flavored milk. For kids who don't like the taste of milk.
I don't like bullshit feminism as much as the next guy (and ecofeminism can be that...at times) but get off your high horse, man.
Ex-girlfriend and I go through a rocky post-breakup period that ultimately seemed to be heading back upwards. But despite all our efforts, she comes forward with questioning her sexuality and wants to try dating girls again. I'm in shambles, she wants nothing to do with me, and I genuinely don't know which emotion I am supposed to feel right now. The breakup sadness has been gone for a while, so I'm left in awe.
Fuck graphic design on fivver. At least as far as the authors go, they are holier than thou ass hats.
I have been working out nine weeks and no one is helping/encouraging me, what do you think?   Also, if I am to keep this up, any idea on how long before my abs start showing/my belly is gone?
Stop complaining about a RANDOM game mode and trying to bring "order" to it.
Lots of things go on for us to see stuff.   Oh, as a sidenote, [there is a possibility that some humans can see ultraviolet]( which is kind of crazy. As another sidenote, feel free to downvote/delete this if it doesn't belong in Askscience.   Also, the edit was to remove a sentence that was out of place.
Boyfriend doesn't want sex more than 1 time a week, says I restrict him from playing Magic when I don't think that I do. How should I proceed from here?
Valve cannot ruin this game anymore than the community has. Any changes to game mechanics are annoyances everyone can play around. The shitty community makes it a place I and others do not want to be a part of.
Crazy drunk and drugged women tried to have sex with myself and a coworker while we were trying to fix her cable
juices are good, don't hesitate to spend your hard hard earned money with the vape kitchen.
there was no "misfire"
I would let your folks stay a while as long as the house is maintained and kept properly. All the money they are saving is just giving them a better retirement and whats left is probably your inheritance anyways. Keeping your folks comfortable is a solid mans work. 250k in the bank won't feel as good as that. Trust Me.
if you aren't scared of learning multiple stroke Kanji for early/basic vocab, and you want to make sure you've got the pronunciation down pat, it's a good investment when combined with other resources.  Otherwise, if you want to start with simple Kanji, you want to do Kanji later, or you believe your accent is good, don't bother.
I think Grady is a well below average CF, Vic is slightly below average, and JBJ is slightly above average.
Using PT sometimes is a bit like when the phone company informs you that "you need to dial a one and then the number." Everything is hardcore manual mode and there's nothing you can do about it.   That being said. It's very worth it to know the its and outs of pro tools. Once you get pro tools everything else comes with ease.
I secretly smoke pot and my significant other is oblivious.
grades matter to some people and less to others - the further you go into physics IMO they start to matter less and less. I find very few of my colleagues really caring about their grades in grad school as long as you don't fail. Keep applying for co-ops, internships, REUs, ask to work for professors, etc... That is the kind of work that matters in the end. Also the relationships with professors and research coworkers that you develop will go a long way in terms of letters of reference and what not.
supporting the low class by force prevents interpersonal kindness and replaces it with obedience.
Heavy smoker, have been clean for three weeks w/ moderate exercise and lots of fluids, is a piss-test passable?
Got robbed at gunpoint, bought guns, shot self, almost fatally
It seems a bug crashes the game if you fight Craig with Cartman near the end. Since I could reproduce the issue with him but not other characters, I assume it's no fluke. If you run into issues, don't use Cartman.
Can't go past loading screen.
Drama is GOOD! It allows fans to see players personalities and team rivalries to form which only makes our eSports scene more interesting to watch   A pretty good example as to what drama can do for an eSports scene:
Yeah, I meant "woah other dimensions dude"
Please read the whole thing but if you absolutely cannot) I am doing a once or more a week stream to try and raise money for a young girl living with Cerebral Palsy, Deafness, Epilepsy, and slight Mental Retardation to have her wish granted through the New Hope for Kids organization.  I will be giving out indie game keys, and even a Borderlands 2 key eventually, all redeemable through steam throughout the next couple weeks as I do this. Please come check me out (fair warning, I am not fantastic at the games I will be playing) and chat. If you can, feel free to donate, if you cannot, please share my stream to others.  I will be starting today around 5-6 so come on by. :)   edit:added link to donation and quick little instructions to this main post from my twitch.tv.  Edit2: I am now live!  edit 3: Edit3: Finished for today about an hour and a half ago. Met a cool guy who helped me with a banner, think i got most of the kinks out of my stream, and i had fun. Did not raise any money besides Awesome_David's generous 10 dollar donation but ill be back every wendsday so please feel free to subscribe. Never hit a number of viewers over 7 so never gave anything away, still have plenty of game codes to give. :)
Getting low fps in a RL when my PC shouldn't be having performance issues..

Weird kid starts cross dressing after his dad died; thought he just snapped and would cause a school shooting but rickrolled everyone instead
pissed my girlfriend off because I got stupid drunk and made a fool of myself and brought up/said dumb shit. Now girlfriend doesn't want to talk to me.
Riot can go fuck themself in the ass with a fucking wrench until they have fixed this shit, fuck dick fuck, die, FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU RIOT.   Jesus christ this makes me look like I'm 12, I should visit a shrink, cya.
Unemployment in Greece doesn't make the locals think its a great idea to sleep in the streets when they got family and friends who can, grudgingly, shelter them.  The social/family ties save the day for now...
You are talking absolute shit.
I've lost thousands in gambling, haven't told my future wife.
future sister in law is part of the wedding processional and family wedding photos for our beach wedding, but wants to wear a hot pink, jewel encrusted prom dress that is fancier than my bridal gown. Not sure if I can/should say something to her without sounding like a bitch.   Edit 2: thanks for all of your feedback. It helped me realize that I just need to take a deep breath and let it go. Hopefully when she is trying on dresses she will realize that what she wants to wear is a little ridiculous for this setting. And if not, I'm sure that everybody else will realize it when the wedding comes.
Fat, spoiled, entitled western women ruined sex.  It's just not sexy anymore.  But they want to keep us jumping through hoops hoping it will get better.
Faith had her act together because she had time to get it together; buffy had no time to deal with her personal issues with the weight of the world on her shoulders.
Just don't bother. Or else, know when to run. OP was in a public, presumably well-lit place, and dealing with dumbass kids. Me? Well, it's just too bad my learning experience required a visit to the ER.
Fucked up my life (alcoholism, debt, set myself back in school). Wondering if I can still maintain attraction with my GF while I piece my life back together.
LeBron's game is based more on his strength and ability to exploit any mismatch (due to his high basketball IQ) which I think he'll still be able to do even towards the end of his career, especially with a more reliable mid-range jumper, as long as the league doesn't become filled with more LeBron-esque players.
don't go on Reddit on your work computer. NOT OK!
Bridges are awesome, fuck this fat bitch.
Drone strikes kill way more civilians than suicide bombings do, and they're done with less care for what happens to civilians.
A kid lied and told the principal that I hit him and called him a nigger.
Problem solving ability is great, but small children are neurologically incapable of the type of executive functioning that is required for meaningful consent.
Split with GF of almost 8 years, we pledged to remain friends, she lives out of town, haven't seen her in 6 months, spoke to her about 4 months ago about skyping/catching up, which she said would be great. She visited my city and left without any contact, knowing that this is the only opportunity she would have to see me. Feel like shit.
just read the damn thing.   EDIT: thanks for reading! cleaned up some punctuation and missing words. I wrote this originally as class was ending (on my iPod which doesn't have the best spell czech) so I was slightly rushed.   EDIT 2: "he hid in the backyard while we were on the backyard" what the fuck is wrong with me. Meant balcony sorry.
