If I take Sisters of Battle in my Black Templars chapter, will they cost more than their standard points value?
younger sister became mentally unwell, was fired, I told our parents who were supportive and helpful.  Hadn't spoken to me for nearly a year- recount acts inaccurately, tells me to go fuck myself, I have no reason to feel hurt, the family would be better if I wasn't around. Help.

I have mild OSA with severe hypoxemia and I'm scared and pissed about it. I'm also an indecisive newlywed who is a few months out from undergoing bariatric surgery.

I'm grateful for any input; I've never known anyone who has been diagnosed or used a machine before.

I'm an experienced Dota 2 player who had a W/L ratio above 50%. Decided to play with a friend who's new to the game. He fed and ruined games, leading to loss streaks. Decided to play alone in a pub game without him, and am now matchmaked with morons, and am constantly losing. My W/L dipped below 50% today. All of my great stats are being ruined. How do I get out of this misery?
I have high sex drive n my gf has close to none. I love her and I don't want to break up. Is there any way to lower my libido?   EDIT: Wow.. thanks everyone for the kind replies and sharing your opinions. I really appreciate it. I'll consider what are my options. For now, I guess I'll talk her into consulting a specialist and see what happens from there. Thanks again guys!

I'm a virgin, she isn't. Thinking about her past makes me feel ill. What are you're thoughts?   EDIT: Added her age.   So I think that I need to drop my idea of what is ideal and not allow the past to affect me so profoundly. Time to adopt the 'Fuck it' mentality society at large seems to hold.

Abandoned gas stations are bad for Oakland's: economy, environment and visual aesthetic. Our tax dollars should fund the retrofitting of these parcels to meet EPA standards to make it feasible for businesses to raise buildings ultimately helping progress many of Oakland's districts [especially East Oakland]. I need help finding the lots, and that is where you can help!   Edit:   "These gas stations closed as a result of the ever fluctuating price of gas" is factually inaccurate.   In fact, there is a [confluence of factors]( affecting demand for corner store gasoline.
cheaters of reddit, it is possible to cheat, to make mistakes, to regret, to grow up, to learn and to have successful beautiful committed relationships either with the ex you cheated on, or with future relationships. I used to believe cheating was wretched and thd end-all to any relationship. I can definitely say that I no longer believe the old adage, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." I also no longer believe that forgiveness is out of the question.

Found a ship, swapped into it (which lead to an autosave right there), then swapped back to old ship.  Flew to space, lost ship, reloaded autosave, and accidentally erased the crashed ship, replacing it with my own while taking its inventory.  I do believe it occurred because within that autosave I was in ownership of the abandoned ship, but I swapped back after, changing ownership to my old ship.  After reloading, it replaced my old "owned" ship with my new "owned" ship.   Here's a two image album comparing the abandoned ship with my now newer-ish starting ship:   EDIT : It seems to only work in a single session of playing, because I reopened the game just now and it replaced my starter ship with the crashed ship.  Do take care with using this if you want to improve your starter ship like this, because it will just replace your ship with the one you did the glitch with after relaunching the game.

So to conclude, "If I were to take a DNA swab of a transgender woman, what sex would the DNA results tell me she was? " It wouldn't. It tells you absolutely nothing. Edit: Phenotype is what is used in the determination of sex in human beings, and that includes everything from genitalia to endocrine system -- and even neurology. We're all real.   Here is more information for those that like to learn:   Genitalia is not the single factor used to determine sex either:   Total number of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female one in 100 births   There are all sorts of variations in humanity.

I was offered a porn deal to make a commercial, I should be set for years after this if I accept. And even more if I impress them and it gets popular. Only I'm not a sexual person, I only have sex occasionally and that's out of love or a friend with benefits. I also have to lie to everyone and basically lose all my dignity.   So I'm stumped, the money would be good but is it worth it? Should I take the job or not? Sell out or keep my dignity.

The magical evolution of elves has been taking place since before the Sundering, this has allowed for the divergence of an entirely new race of elves (the High Elves) from Night Elves, with the Highborne somewhere in between.  On the other hand, the green orcs (which are as you point out, still orcs (I flipped the example because Mag'har is the more ancestral species)) have only been divergent from Mag'har orcs for about 40 years and as such, the two are completely and totally incomparable.   Note:  The difference between the Mag'har and Greens is much more like the difference between the Highborne and  Night  Elves.  This divergence has also been around since before the Sundering, but I suppose magical evolution requires something besides time.  Whatever that something is, the High Elves  did  diverge into a seperate species (in the Azerothian sense) from Highborne.

At the moment I have conflicting viewpoints within myself. One that, Islam is the true religion and Allah is who I must thank and worship. The other that I can only rely on myself and there is no such thing as "God's Religion." This conflict is causing inner turmoil and taking up the bulk of my thoughts. I'm constantly thinking about this, "which opinion is right?"   I guess the purpose of this post is to ask for your advice on my situation, and anecdotes of your own similar experiences.

Visited family and they had a one year old who is clearly under developed and not healthy- refuses to go to a doctor because someone (no medical training at all) at their cult-like church says the baby is fine. Also she wants to have about four more kids because she likes the biblical names they picked out.   EDIT: Just to clarify- the child is not neglected, she still BF with solids in her diet. CPS is a drastic course to take when all the information is not present, these are very distant relatives to me so I think I need to talk to everyone a little more. Everyone is entitled to raise their kid how they want- they aren't vaccinated which; to me shows so much stupidity on the parents part but the kids are not neglected, and are being fed. The fact that they trust a person at their church vs. a trained doctor is just baffling to me especially when their are some obvious signs that something is wrong. I am contacting her and trying to get more information and also talking to direct relatives. I will update if people are interested.

It's not like Wheeler did particularly good against the run this year as well). Provided he can be acceptable in run defense, there's no reason not to pencil him in as the OLB starter.

Hindsight bias makes you think what you did worked because you already know the outcome. There needs to be more done to mitigate hindsight bias in proving cause and effect.   EDIT:  I just want to point out that just because there is a bias it does  NOT  mean the effect isn't true. For example, I might have a strange therapy that I pioneer where I make the person spin around 3 times before the start of each session. I do this with a lot of people throughout the years and they tend to improve. In fact, I can distinctly remember the times when people got better, and I can even remember the times when I  didn't  do the spinning therapy and people didn't improve or even got worse! I can't really think of any times where I did the spinning therapy and people didn't improve (those cases are boring, why would I remember them anyways where nothing special happened in relation to my theory?) So I write my theory on Spinning Therapy and I go and give presentations about how my therapy is so effective because of the improvements I noticed in my clients. I totally committed the hindsight bias where I assume what I did had an effect. Yet then Spinning Therapy goes through rigorous trials and research and lo-and-behold, it actually is very efficacious! Just because I committed the hind sight bias does  not  mean I still didn't happen to find an effect. So the advice that millionaires or very successful people might give, even though it might be due to the hindsight bias, can still be valid.

Based on the presence of round towers, gargoyles, and internal warmth, I think that some or all of Winterfell was built by people from Valyria   EDIT: Thanks for all the great comments! I completely agree that the dates don't add up very well. What I should've implied (kindly suggested by u/Bayasabhad) is that Winterfell and Dragonstone were potentially built by the ancestors (or founders?) of what would later be the Valyrian civilisation. Also, I didn't mean to say that they were built at the same time...there could have been centuries or even millennia between the building of the two. I just thought it was interesting that there were several similarities between the two and what are later called 'Valyrian Technologies'.   It's also worth clarifying that although the warmth of the castles might be down to their location, the point  I'm making is that the natural world was manipulated in order to intentionally create that effect, which in itself is pretty advanced. Additionally I think it would be an oversight to put the gargoyles down to being a coincidence. When they are mentioned (which isn't very often), they are mentioned repeatedly and that seems to be the way that GRRM stresses the importance of something. Just my thoughts on the matter!

I discovered I was poly very early on, husband was open to non-monogamy but does not want me to be with other people without him (though neither of us like casual sex). I've fallen for a close friend, husband shuts down when discussing things. I'm willing to move slow; I'm not willing to be monogamous. I'm also battling codependent habits in our marriage, though my husband does not want counselling. Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated.
Boyfriend can't tell me why he doesn't want to have sex, leaves me very confused and questioning what he could be hiding from me.   I guess I just need some advice, maybe seen from a different perspective. I can't tell if I'm overreacting or being selfish or what... :/

Things are looking better - I have his phone number.   Update 2/3/15 7pm   Owner texted me this : Guys looked at the fence and your exposed wall and said it would cost $1400 to fix. Approximately $600 of that cost involves tyvek insulation paper and siding on the exterior of your wall, which I can cover. The additional work involves:   -Framing new bargeboard at the top of your shed & capping it with aluminum.   -Installing necessary wood studs to exterior of shed.(our back room that has a bathroom and pantry)   -Installing R13 batt insulation between all studs.   -Installing 1/2" osb plywood to studs   -Installing new 4x4" pressure treated wooden post embedded into earth with concrete footing to secure fence. If you contribute $900 I will oversee that all this work is completed.   [This is the zillow link for what the house looked like before they did the work, ours is blue next door.]( That means that they razed their room and left our stuff bare... shouldn't they legally be required to fix that?

both the dual resource and stam only build will work fine solo/small group content/trials   both of the specs translate good enough that u can use whichever you want for whichever scenario.  so if u want to have the double resource pool build (during this patch) to make ur soloing and vet dungeons better – u can easily make a bar with vampire’s bane, biting jabs, and spell symmetry for an easy 600+ dps spam – weaving in light attacks to clip biting jabs   this post is in relation to min/maxing ONLY, ie:     min/max build for solo/small group = dual resouce (so far with 1.2.3 as current patch)     min/max build for trials = Stamina build (so far with 1.2.3 as current patch)

It may be a doable to import water to planets in the future, but current technology is definitely not up to the task yet.   Also, given a planet with the right conditions, we may be able to introduce bacteria to do the hard work for us... after all, it was cyanobacteria that gave us an oxygen-rich atmosphere on Earth. The downside is that this would take millions of years to make a meaningful change to a CO2 rich atmosphere that planets like Venus or Mars or young Earth have/had.

For a lay audience: Call it a hybrid sandbox-themepark (even then many people don't know those terms) and for mmorpg dedicated audience I'd call it Truly as per what you see with EVE being all about 1) massive-multiplayer 2) player actions and interactions = RPG.   Of course, it's just a label at the end of the day to spur discussion and you can equally call it either I'd suggest? Comparatively it's a good way to distinguish above all looking at how variable the others are eg quasi-mmos that are closer to multiplayer of a few dozen (max?) in SotA all the way up to what PFO is aiming in the order of thousands in a settlement, which I think is much much bigger than any of the others are intending even ESO with it's RvRvR?

The parrot fish does eat coral and shit sand.  However, he's not the sole one nor is he the biggest contributor of sediments responsible for the creation of most beaches or islands in the Caribbean as the tittle may imply. Odds are, if you are walking on the beach you are stepping mostly on corals and the skeletal remains of dead stuff.  Or quartz.   Nonetheless the parrot fish is an incredibly important species for the shallow marine ecosystem.  So the parrot fish is still awesome.

I didn't acknowledge this, but rather continued correcting their strategy (don't you love pugging into a guild raid and showing them up) and they never mentioned it again.

But most of the time it just makes me cringe. The problem is, a lot of the humor is just "they're nerds" or "they're awkward" or "haha they're awkward nerds." At its worst it's [very close to this](   But if you try to dissect it too much and look at why "this joke is wrong!" or "they're scientists, they wouldn't do it like that!" and ignore that  it's a mainstream sitcom with a huge audience of geeks and non geeks alike , you reveal yourself as one of those awkward nerds, and the butt of the joke.

Despite the fact that this isn't something most people see in every day life, this feels plain because of the nearly monochromatic colors and poor lighting.   I will add that amazing monuments like this are sometimes the hardest things to capture well because they are so amazing in person. Often times our photography of these monuments don't reflect our emotions because we don't give enough sense of scale (for instance these elephants could be 30ft tall or 1ft tall and I would have no idea), or a sense of detail and ornateness. We don't have all of the things that you as the photographer had when you took the photo, so try and help us.

Due to anxiety and stress (and me being an idiot) I really screwed up bad with how I chose to break up with my girlfriend and I want to make things right.   It's summer break at the moment and I'm still friends with her on Facebook (despite removing her on every other social media we were connected on). My goal isn't to get back together with her or get her attention or anything like that. I just want to, at the most, become friends again. At the least I want her to remember me as less of a jerk and more of an alright person. What I've been planning to do is sometime mid July send her a message something like this "Hey Anna! We haven't talked in a while and I was just wondering, how have you been? Are you enjoying your summer?" In my head this seems like a good idea and it'll make me seem like less of a distant figure and more like a friendly person again. What I want to know is, is this a good idea? Am I making a mistake or should I go for it? Also it's been a little over 6 months since the breakup. Any info you can give me is much appreciated!

This build is incredibly flexible and is able to produce hard-hitting phantasms from any weapon while keeping all the utility from mesmer reflects.     You can try to make a build that can do phantasms and shatter but you have to choose between focus reflects and the extra shatter effect + might.   [Base](   [Shatter Traited Base]( - There are other options for Illusions master trait.   [Phantasm Traited Base]( - Yeah, I'd like Phantasmal Haste to be there but it doesn't apply to gs, sword, and focus so meh. Maybe if you loooved sword/pistol + staff. If you're using null field and feedback, those blinds are pretty handy.   Anyway, from these you can put 10 into Inspi for focus trait or 10 into Illusions for might + extra shatter effect.   You can do phantasms if you feel like it, you can do shatter if you feel like it. However, without the 25 trait from Inspi, your phantasms will deal less than 10/20/0/25/15.

Yes, learn JavaScript first, but as soon as you've got the hang of it, gain an understanding of one or more of the following (Python, PHP, Ruby, C#, C, C++, Java, SQL) then learn to understand the difference between imperative, object oriented, event driven, functional, declarative programming styles.

deleting score cards and starting over immediately after 2 losses will cap your vendor reward packages at whatever wins you had when deleting the first scorecard.   (I can't 100% confirm this but only my 3rd character didn't receive final gold tier loot and it was the only character I deleted my score card on)   Also: if you don't go flawless on your first score card you can either finish and buy a new one or discard and get a new one with a new chance at flawless again. This is confirmed. You can also rebuy all 3 buffs with each new scorecard purchase.

newly found anger management problems resurface after one day I decide to stand my ground. I don't want to be wasting time or energy thinking about shit that doesn't matter, but I have grown very angry and hateful for the past 6 months.   I guess my question is how do I balance standing my ground and letting go of stuff that is not worth it getting hung up on. How do I stand my ground without hating my friends for breaking their promises, insulting me in public or feeling anger towards everything remotely unfair?

The script could of been much more compelling if they stopped trying to force the relationship they didn't quite get to work for much of the audience in the first film and instead tapped into the fertile ground of what makes Thor different from the rest of the MCU, the non-Earth Realms and the intricate dynamics already established with this family of warrior gods and how they affect all they rule/protect, IMHO.   This is the one reddit comment [I've agreed with most so far in regards to Thor the Dark World, and probably does a much better, more balanced, and more concise, job critiquing the movie and explaining how the editing failed this film.](   ^edit: ^I ^should ^pre-proofread ^the ^long ^ones   ^edit: ^when ^reddit ^doesn’t ^properly ^save ^multiple ^extensive ^correction ^edits...

me and my girlfriend are taking a break (long distance) and I accidentally read this facebook chat that she had with some guy that she has been friends with for three months at college. (He really liked her at one point and tried to bait her into going out with him and probably still likes her now.):     Her: Hi sexy, sorry to bother you, what are you doing for the rest of the night? BD: homework -------- sarcastic conversation about evil music instructor ---------  Her: I’ll let you go then, sorry to be a distraction.  BD: I’m the distraction BD: cya.   EDIT: The concern is whether or not I should worry about my girlfriend saying "Hi sexy, sorry to bother you, what are you doing for the rest of the night?" to a guy that most likely still likes her.   EDIT: Keep in mind. This is really hard on me, I love her very much and there is no definitive proof of any sort of  real  treachery. She has always been very honest with me, and I feel really bad about assuming the worst.   UPDATE: Thank you all for your advice! I think I have a good grasp of the situation, and I will talk to her about it during thanksgiving to clear up any confusion and see where that will take me. Again, thank you all.

There are people for whom a more independent and at-times dismissive style works well. That's great. Not everyone will be compatible with it though. That should be okay too.

The current champion select method is a random factor that this game could do without. The meta is meant to be enforced to a certain level so do us the greater good and allow players to queue for specific roles. Keep all else the same in champ select but at least offer us this so there is a better chance to have a favorable champion select.

Rename account, keep alias. You won't lose anything.   Edit: backend update in the past allows you to sign in with an alias, but use the account info from the main email without breaking any linking to devices, that was why there was a warning about renaming your account before it.
I think most of the problem concerning vehicles come from the lack of a marked choice. -If all vehicles are supposed to be just force multiplier then they are too accessible and require too much investment ( learning, certing ). -If some vehicles are supposed to act as class they lack incentives to fight each other and they are not accessible enough ( nanite cost , skill floor).   &nbsp;   I understand that those kind of thing are hard to balance but I was curious to know what the devs position on vehicles role was.

You can blend between many keyed animations to achieve really complex movements, but some of your animations can be procedural, and driven by a physics engine instead.

Sellers AND buyers alike will try to fuck you over and pull a fast one on you.  I've made over 130 hot wheels purchases on ePay in the last 2-3 years and I'd say about 1 in 10 of them involve a seller either refusing to send the cars (meaning they didn't like the selling price- hey dumbass, ever heard of a  reserve ?) or they send me a duplicate car that's in obviously worse condition like it's no big deal (one had the nerve to get mad at me for leaving him "neutral" feedback for this, because, since he gave me a full refund (after tying up my money for 2 weeks) I'm supposed to leave positive feedback after he tried to dupe me with a damaged item... Asshole. Oh and that was a guy with over 3000 positive feedback with ZERO negative! 100%! Yes, even the "good guys" will try to screw with you when given the chance!).  Yes, 1 in 10 is VERY high considering I only buy from sellers with very good feedback.  That's fucked up.  But it shows that Ebay is full of scumbags who WILL take advantage of opportunities to make a buck off you.  Buyer or seller.  I have more stories to add to this wall of text but unless you're a toy collector you probably couldn't relate.     If you read all that, THANK-YOU I just needed to vent a bit. I always hear about how "it's always the buyer trying to screw over the seller" on ebay but HELL NO!  It goes both ways my friends!

Anyways, I was just curious, according to whenever you were born, any pop culture phenomenons or just things it seems like everyone else took part in you just completely missed? I'm honestly really curious about people who were born 5+ years on either side of me, what you feel left out of due to the sheltering children from the world obsession I'm assuming a lot of us went though. I'm also curious about people around my age, if the rules were different, or the same, or more harsh, etc. We should all get together have some cocktails and watch Goonies and Ferris Bueller's day off, I swear.   (Some strange random oversights they must have had? To this day I love Star Trek: TNG and watched it during its late 80s/mid 90s run...that show is  really  progressive leaning if you get into the subtext, sometimes to a slapping you in the face level. Yet I was allowed to watch that? Also I was allowed to watch the  Dark Crystal   ETA  OMG, I just had another random memory, they seriously had BET (Black Entertainment Channel)  BLOCKED  with a code on the cable (in addition to MTV, VH1, etc). hahahaha holy shit, RACIST! Oh Mormons.

ing all the time, you're basically wasting your life on confirmation bias highs. I set aside 1-2 hours per day (around bed time) for reading news.   I know what you're thinking - most of my sources are Western, or Anglophone heavy... I would love to find alternatives, but generally speaking this is where I find the gems that I spend time on.   Some regions have no reliable press 'outlet' - for example, due to lack of internet publishing, or censorship, or language barriers, or a combination of all. I've only found interesting Iran commentators in the Iranian diaspora for example, so on some issues you have to look for specific people likely to know what they're talking about, instead of something as vague as 'a news site.'   I also follow a number of think tanks and policy centers, but more for figuring out what the power structures they represent want to believe about how the world works.

with some math terms is a bad joke that only you don't get.   Actually, its called calling you out for being a bullshitter.   > The guy arguing to stop paying taxes makes more sense than your "I'm an MS in Math so listen to me argument" because money doesn't equal education. Money does not equal education.   Just because you can't find a reasonable way to respond, and don't understand enough statistics to do the analysis yourself doesn't mean he makes more sense.   > I am not rich.   Then you're speaking way above your paygrade most likely.   > Guess what, you have no statistical evidence to prove them wrong.   Except for the things I already posted?   > All data analysis, wait, let me type slower and use that universal statement again for all the MS's in Math students, ALL statistical evidence supports the fact that children receiving an education at home perform better than those in public education.   Hi, you are fucking retarded. All data does not support your point. That is absurd. You can't just claim this and expect me to not call you out for bullshitting. What about the evidence I've posted? That would kind of defeat the word "all".   >  The National education program is the most costly per capita education in the world and it fails the students. Did I make too many linear extrapolations there?   Yes, because per capita doesn't measure the discontinuities. Do you even understand what a reductive fallacy is?   > Homeschooling kids is on the rise, and exponentially, because parents know intuitively what you do not: They are the best hope their child has.   Let me tell you this again  homeschool kids do not do better than their counterparts always, and this is in no way true. This is called bullshit conjecture .   > I was poor when I had my kid, and I'm less poor now, but they are my responsibility and I didn't whine to the government to teach them for me.   Where did you go to school when you were a poor kid?   >  PARENTS HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO MAKE TIME FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN THE BEST EDUCATION/CHANCE. IN AMERICA, THE RESOURCES ARE ALREADY FREE.   No, you're making this too simple.   > Your argument can be reduced to, 'poor people should expect the government to do for their children what they have been unable to do with their own life.'   No, it can't. That is called absurd reductionism and is not fit for public policy discussions. My argument is that educating poor children usually leads to less overall crime (when we're not doing drug laws and shit). This means less incarceration costs, and ultimately a more educated populus. You are pretending the world is so simple, yet you can't even see the nuance here.   > American government supports monopolistic control of resources, job outsourcing, and an increase in taxation without representation and when the poor end up without the time to educate their children you believe you can throw some math terms at it and understand why our educational system is failing the students. More money will not produce more education if spent as it has historically spent by our government.   Hahahahahahahahahaha. Want to check with the 40s-70s? They disagree. The GI bill does as well. You don't just get to come out and make blanket claims and expect me to accept them on faith do you?   > You are, in fact a perfect example of the myopic product of the American School system, I agree   I think you mean someone calling you out on your bullshit reductionism.   > and as a public policy advisor, a perfect example of the American Governmental Bureaucracy.   Why, because I want you to  prove what you're saying and not throw poor children under the bus?  I'm sorry if reality has too many problems for your fantasy political system to agree with. But that's life.   >  I see you holding a big sign over your head saying "Stay Calm, and pay more taxes." It'll work this time, trust us, we have an MS in math.   Or me volunteering my time and trying to make a difference instead of sitting on my ass, pretending I'm a statistician and then making large sweeping generalization to fit my fantasy world? Yeah, sorry but I think I need your analysis still. I'm still waiting.   >  is incorrect because it presumes parents actually have time for their kids demonstrates a deep level of disconnect and a psychosis that shouldn't be seriously considered.   I'm sorry, the kids already exist. What do you suggest we do about them? I'm not showing a disconnect, you are. You can't just say "well they shouldn't have had kids!" because that doesn't solve problems.

Hydrogen and helium are placed on opposite ends of the periodic table for two different reasons. In the end, it doesn't really matter.
The APA does not consider IQ tests approximations of intelligence. Leading academics consider them proven irrelevant to other cultures. IQ tests’ purpose is simply to identify extremes within comparable cultural groups.   Knowing this, do you really think there is no history and continued institutional racism against black people that causes them to have higher than normal crime rates?   You're only "Right" in a technical sense. Blacks DO commit more crimes. However they don't do it because they're lesser beings or because the white man is superior, and there is no evidence of that. But if you don't understand statistics and don't understand WHY things happen or look at history (I dunno if you know about this but there was this whole "slavery" thing that happened that kinda tends to set two peoples apart a fair bit), then no, you can't claim to "know damn well that you're right."   Do blacks committ more crime? Sure. EVery single other thing you've said about them has been false. You're just a racist looking for information to back up your racist views.

It's possible to work through cheating with honesty and good communication, but if a relationship wasn't great to begin with, it might not be worth saving. Getting cheated on can make it extremely difficult to trust future partners; be aware of the difference between healthy suspicion and paranoia. And if you have a hard time telling truth from lies... DON'T DATE ACTORS.

is that, if I was in your shoes, out of love for my friend and her family, I'd consider the abortion. Kristi was "lucky". She was one of the best-case-scenarios medically speaking because she lived so long, something like top 95% when you look at lifespan. My friend did have some good times to go along with the dark times, and she lived long enough to touch a lot of people's lives, but . . . she had to pay an awfully high price for those rare times when she could act like a normal kid, and I'm not sure if it was worth the suffering she had to go through . . . it's a very difficult issue.

GF[25F] and I[26M] planned for a LDR in October 2013-March 2014 for my Job in the USA. I got another job offer in the UK (at the same place we work together now). If I accept the offer the LDR will get pushed back until May 2014-October 2014. GF is 'sick with worry' about the LDR and upset about the postponement and is emotionally withdrawing. Rationally we both agree that the pro's of my taking both Job's outweigh the negatives but she claims that its not the best thing for her/us emotionally. I need advice on how to proceed with alleviating her worries/pain about the LDR. Rock and a hard place.
I have lurked on reddit for about a year and lucked into SRS today. The racism and sexism of reddit have long bothered me, but after seeing it all in one place, I think I'm ready to bail. Are there good reasons to stay? Thank you, SRS. I think you do something really important.

is it "normal" to pull out hair? Not really, but it isn't rare especially when minor. Is it an "issue"? It depends on how you feel, but if you are uncomfortable with this or really anything in your life, it is worth taking the time to address it. The fact that you've found this sub probably means you're willing to do just that.

1 - Don't let the negative comments get you down. 2 - Be yourself, don't change for anybody. 3 - Talk with your fiance, if she gives no apology then show her the front door. 4 - Speak with your family. If they still don't understand, thats their problem and shouldn't have to be your own.

lysozyme has a great bacterial lysis ability, but the amount in your tears isn't enough to really kill off bacteria in a wound. We use 25 microliters of a 10mg/mL concentration to lyse cells in the lab and we have to add it to a lysing solution to aid the enzyme. A wound would require a much higher level to actually protect against harmful microbes. Use warm soap and water.

answer is: If you want to get some one off screen printing done, go to a screen printing house. If you want to start a clothing business, become the biggest obsessive nerd you can, not about fashion, but about supply chains and clothing manufacturing and marketing. Then, a year later, you will give it up, understanding why so many people do it, and why so many fail... or do the scariest thing in your life, and go for it. You become someone who does. Does everything.   Try reading a bit at the Fashion Incubator website. It has some good info.

there be a crazy bitch on the loose   EDIT: formatting YES I FINALLY GOT IT TO WORK sorry about that EDIT 2: I forgot to add a few very specific things:     After she gave me a synopsis of how hard she worked my bf all day, how close they were when they were swimming, etc, I told him he needed to watch out for her and that she's overstepping her bounds. Later in the night, when we were talking about what we did all day, he said that all he did was sit in front of the computer and make deliveries, with a few glances at her. Idk, this could be me just being paranoid.   He told me that when they hang out, she tries to get him to convince me to have sex with her. When he told her he wasn't sure I was in to girls, she asked him if they could share me (ok not gonna lie that sounds so fucking hot but this chick is crazy and obsessive and I would not let her into my pants).   He makes it a point to tell me when she has had sex...which..I don't know...good for her, I guess? I really don't give a damn if/who she's fucking unless it directly affects me.   She asked to go with him on a delivery, and I sent him a text that he was not to be in the car alone with her that night. So he convinced one of the other workers to do the delivery for him, and then later on in the night offered her a ride home. Again, I said no to that and they ended up carpooling with someone else.     Sorry this is so long guys, I've been just really weirded out by the whole situation. I don't want to be that jealous girlfriend who tells him he can't hang out with her, and he has said that the only reason he does hang out with her is to use her pool. But that doesn't explain why she's at the house all day, unless he's just bad at saying No, which isn't exactly a good thing.

Also, long needed Karma sink is great.   5) Temple icons spread throughout map really adds flavor.   6) It's great to see regular people out in the open world again.   7) I no longer hate Risen as much as Teemo, but Karka are still a pain... good thing I never have to go there again  coughnomoreorinodecough   Not to mention the other amazing features this patch added. Making fractals a better experience, shorter/long term rewards with laurels, and the removal of rez-rushing really make the game feel polished. I can't imagine what the much larger patches in the coming months will bring!

Be wary of response curve when doing combinations. Lesson learned: titrate up slowly.  Especially too if other research chemicals half-lives may still be active in your system.

My dad is trying to force me into letting my brother stay with me and my girlfriend, rent free, even though she's not comfortable with it.

How do I know if I'm a sociopath? Would I know? Is it possible that I, like, am lying to myself about my own emotions or something? That I don't actually desire friendship and relationships but I lie to myself about it all?   ALSO: On the internet I read a lot of "IF YOU'RE ASKING, THEN YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT A SOCIOPATH LOLOLOL" Is this true, that caring about whether or not there's something wrong with you precludes you from being sociopathic?

If you have broader shoulders and don't want a plunging V, give the men's shirts a try!   UPDATE:     Everlane men's small V-neck: Very long, oddly boxy in shoulders, V fairly shallow. Liked the color and comfort, so kept it, but I don't see myself wearing it that often.     Everlane women's medium U-neck: Nice drape, not too long. My new favorite of the Everlane t-shirts, which I wouldn't have thought from their photos. Thanks for the tip /u/lgbtqbbq!     Uniqlo women's medium modal linen t-shirt: Fantastic fit, drapes well, and feels nice. Comes in a variety of good neutrals, however, every color is see-through. Yes, even the darker ones.     Uniqlo women's medium supima cotton round neck short sleeve t-shirt: As far as I can tell, pretty much identical to the Everlane U-neck. Material seems a little thinner and shinier (a lot of Uniqlo cotton is shiny, why?). Comes in a nice grey and a whole bunch of more difficult pastels.

I need Ideas to help me raise 1000 euros, by selling 1000 things, artwork, poetry..I'm a foriegner who has problems managing my finance and life... This is not gonna be easy.   EDIT**I'm looking for work, my last job was too stressful and caused me to have a breakdown where I went into a major depressive episode for about 5 months, and spent the majority of the time in bed, Other times, I am manic and seem to  have no problems, but just throw my money away. It's rediculous and very difficult. I cannot find a counsellor or therapist that is free in this country, who will speak english... I'm scared to give much info away because I'm very shy and paranoid. In short, I need to find a less stressful job, which probably will not pay as much as I am used to. But I'm more looking for a way just to pay for me teeth - it's one thing I think will help me in life a lot - so I'm looking for simple ideas which could work without having to humiliate myself even more. Saving money is possible, once I find a job - but I'm almost positive that when I get a new job, I will become manic and forget totally about my teeth - which Is why I need to make a unique and separate plan...I am already starting to think this is hopeless.

The support gets less gold WILLINGLY in order to secure objectives and fend off junglers with proper warding. Your issue is that you don't like supporting, and you likely don't like the current meta because you can't 2v2 effectively without one of you being forced into support role  (but this is only in high level competitive play, because skill and teamwork varies greatly in casual games and lower leagues).

On/Off relationship with boyfriend, good at first, now losing feeling. Not sure if I should stay with him. It would be better for me to go in my opinion but I can't seem to.   EDIT: Can't seem to get my months right.   UPDATE: We broke up. He kind of took it bad and said he will probably end up going back to his old ways, and basically pulled the guilt trip, telling me it probably means nothing to me though. I let him know I will still be here if he ever wants a friend. Thank you all for you support. I really appreciate all your comments. <3

Overall I think you are in really strong shape especially considering that you are working fulltime and at school fulltime (hat tip to you). There may be opportunities to optimize your investments and you should definitely start using a TFSA. Your spending in utilities is the main expense that jumps out.

I've considered 100s of nightmare AI scenarios, and most of them are unrealistic or not as bad even if it did happen. I didn't write them all here, but no matter what you provide, the idea that a super-intelligent super-logical AI would have human goals and negative intentions is crazy and an irrational anti-technology fear. It would embrace mutual benefit, because it would understand evolution and biology, and co-exist with humanity for positive intentions. Note that even the most evil men in humanity, Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Mao, these guys all had irrational belief systems that wouldn't exist in an AI. Even if it did have terrible intentions, it would not be that much superior than a few national leaders with powerful armies. And no ones going to give armies to a machine. If the AI is super smart, national-leaders / generals will use the AI as an advisor, not a "general".   edit: thanks for gold. Added genetic scenario. Feel free to PM me a nightmare scenario you think is worse or unpredictable etc. I'll be sure to tell my AI not to do it :). Don't worry I won't be one of the scientists in the movies that tries to make "a human" AI that has no hard-coding. AI developers are not looking for imperfection (humans), we're looking for perfection so that we can make money.

Ask her straight up if you can learn truth through faith.   Ask yourself how you would feel if she tried to force her beliefs onto you.   Now ask yourself how you would feel is she forced them on your children.   Now consider how she is already reacting to the possibly of even raising them without religion (asserting that she wants to raise them christian) before a kid even exists.   The writing is already on the wall.
Ate brownies, had blue lips and white/yellow face. Unsure if I should be concerned.   Has anyone had similar experiences with such symptoms, and if so, can you offer any advice? Should I be concerned about this; is it worth mentioning to a doctor, or can it be simply explained as a side effect of marijuana?   Thanks.

107 days (yesterday). Never had sex without ED med assistance, used 50mg of Viagra instead of typical 100mg. First time going into sex without an erection, managed to get one through foreplay and was 100% hard. Didn't fantasise at all, just focused on the lady and orgasmed, although I felt a slight amount of DE. Plan to continue to reduce the dose of Viagra with each attempt and continue not using P, not M'ing and only O'ing when having sex.

Rocky Horror Picture Show lips are wrinkly and old looking, not sexy and shiny.
TPP has been negotiated completely in secret from the start.  The most anyone in the public knows about the various drafts have come from Wikileaks of all places, because all of the parties involved have been silent on the content of the agreement.   Many of those who actually know some of the details that are being hammered out in TPP are saying that it will hurt the middle class and mainly serves to benefit corporate interests.  The President is fighting his own party in trying to force this treaty through congress.   The bill being discussed in this article will allow the treaty to be passed quickly, and without Congress having any say in as far as the treaty's content.   I don't know about the rest of you, but this sounds a little to me like  subverting the democratic process in the name of corporate interest.

I know there was probably a good reason for getting rid of it but I just don't understand why the community that unified us is no longer.   I know there is an r/misc now but it doesn't feel the same. People are saying it is basically a replacement for r/reddit and are steering people there for things that are submitted in the wrong places. Instead of having to re-build, I wish we could just have our reddit back. I'd hate to miss out on great content that is being posted to super specific unknown subbreddits.

Its sounds cool and helps the give the myth detail but doesn't really mean anything   Edit: it also has a better cadence than earlier translations of genesis; which simply state the order. Also it is hinted that a small pantheon of gods are called in to help out but disappear after a short council. I think that might have been the Yahwist text, but I don't feel like looking it up.

stuffofepics loses his most prized possession but gains so much more while compensating for it.
Met girl at work, hit it off, she found it worth it to keep talking to me.. we became good friends and quickly slipped into a romance.  She claims to have never felt this way before and really like me.. but her actions and continuing distance seem to prove otherwise.  She has been quite distant and often "hermits" or is "soul searching", during which time I can see her interacting with people--myself not included.   We haven't hung out a month and a week or some change.. and most conversations during that time have been based around work (which she is no longer apart of).   I believe that she just needs time alone.. but it  feels  like she just lost the crush overnight one night and is now pushing me away.

Because of the networking backends, you can't compare hacking in CS to hacking in LoL/Dota 2/SC/WoW.   EDIT: By the way, I've developed games in the past and I regularly work with networked systems; I'm not pulling this out of my ass. I've never coded a hack or an anti-cheat system, though, so some of this is (educated) guesswork based on my knowledge of these systems' backends.

His tribesmen, seeing the defeat of their chieftain, knew they could not defeat you on the field of battle so they retreated into the shadows and wrote "Lutusp is a poopyhead" on the walls.

Later, she told me she was having sex with a guy who had a girlfriend and I told her that was not ok and was not supportive, as I think that cheating is awful and one of the worst things. She bashed me and is saying that I'm just jealous of her to my friends and said that I'm always judging people, so now everyone thinks I'm a bad friend and a bitch.

Apparently the dorm is much dustier than I realized; the dust filter over the PSU intake was almost blocked, and the heatsink looked like a crematorium. I cleaned the filter, but any possible electrical problems did not resolve themselves, and heat hasn't been an issue yet despite the state of the heatsink (I will literally hit 'enter' to run prime95 and instantly crash, so I don't think throtting is the issue). I'll buy an air duster, clean the case out, and see how that goes.

Graphics aren't as good as other racing games out for PS4, but considering the openness of the map and the sheer size of it, I'm content with the graphics. The map is fucking huge, but the gameplay is pretty boring. It drives like Watch Dogs, which isn't a good thing. The story is a super predictable Fast & Furious-esque plot. Then again, who really cares about the story in a racing game. Finally, I don't think it's worth $60.   Edit: Honestly, take all of this with a grain of salt because everyone has different experiences playing a game. I suggest watching live streams or YouTube videos of people playing to see if it's something you would enjoy.

Reload perks are one of most crucial armor perks and it's just sad to see certain items with great potential go to waste because a single bad reload perk can make-or-break that gauntlet piece. Maybe not so much for PvE, but for PvP, the advantage is too significant to be ignored. I think we need better options regarding these reload perks to help improve QoL and diversify our options of what to use/wear with regarding armor pieces.

If you don't eat enough fiber in your diet to keep things moving through your intestines on a daily basis...hard substances like nuts or seeds that don't fully digest will sit in your gut and slowly rub a sore (diverticuli) into the wall of the intestine which can get infected (diverticulitis) [which can burst and then you die from internal bleeding](   Which is exactly what happened next!!!   There...I saved you from having to read the sordid details. So if you have no jimmies left to spare today, please for the love of god close this fps and go stare at some kittens, fly a kite, or simply do anything,  ANYTHING  other than read what I am about to describe next.**   .   Every sentence and picture from here out should be considered NSFL and probably NSFW.   You have been warned!!!   >Ham Fountain’s diverticulitis...was from decades of shitty eating and neglect.  He had just had his 40th birthday colonoscopy, and the GI lab found his intestines riddled with diverticula and a few really bad diverticulitis on the verge of bursting and lots of impacted fossilized shit. The doctor was freaked out and ordered immediate surgery. Instead of a drastic colon resection, the surgery he went in for was to essentially put a rubber band around the infected pouch.and seal it off from the intestines so that he wouldn’t damage it.   >Then he had to follow a strict diet for the rest of his life and take extra care for his digestive health.   Being an FPS do you guys think [he followed it?](   >Immediately after his surgery he ordered a massive haul of fast food to be sent to the room instead of eating his prescribed liquid diet. No one knew how he got it in there or who even brought it to him. Buckets of chicken and bags of burgers. He ate all of it as quickly as he could so the nurse couldn’t see it and hid the garbage behind a room chair (they found it later). This being a fresh surgery to his colon he started having severe abdominal pressure and pain. Instead of calling the nurse (like a 5 year old afraid of getting in trouble) he gets up to try to use the bathroom. The amount of straining he had to do in order to push that massive boulder of greasy protein fast food shit past the narrowed section of colon caused the band to burst and his colon to rupture and then he started to bleed internally.   From my understanding, when you have a lower GI bleed in your intestines you don’t really feel it happening. The blood in rest of your body starts draining into about 20-30 ft of your intestines and eventually you pass out from the low blood pressure  because all of your blood is backing up from your ass to your stomach.   >When the nurse came in to do a vital signs check, he was passed out on the floor with a cheeseburger in hand with no pulse.   >She screamed down the hallway for help and slammed the Code Blue button on the wall....

Play something you are good at.  7) Objective oriented again... Early game I see so many players overcommit. You get a tower, and people don't go back. Early game respawn timers are very short, so what was a good fight and a tower, ends up being a team wipe suddenly. Can you get their tower or is a fast roshan better? 2 dead on their team? Do Roshan then. It may sound boring, but objectives and farm is what will get you to higher MMR. At least if you are not god of mechanical skills like some 8k MMR players. I know I am not, so I try to play smart.  8) Know if you can win the lane or not. Sometimes you are not supposed to get kills, just survive and get xp. IF you are the offlaner don't panick if it's hard. Just get xp and wait. The worst you can do is feed their carry many kills in the first 15 mins.   Hope I get to 4k!

2 years in, is our love evolving or stagnating? When does lust turn to love? I want to separate real love from my perception of 'Hollywood' love..   PS - More contextual info..     We come from different backgrounds - he immigrated to my country as a teen, and so we have some varying cultural views that require constant communication and understanding from both sides. I (f) am also 2 inches taller and 40 lbs heavier - and sometimes am self conscious about the stares we get in public. Mostly my problem, not his. He is kind and understanding about my insecurities, however, and is always proud to walk hand-in-hand.       We have spoken about marriage and the future - and agree to take it step by step, though he is fully committed and in it for the long run. I have expressed my doubt of a long term commitment and we have talked this 'part' of our relationship out many times.       The one major thing we fight about is how much he plays video games. I didn't grow up with TV - so I have no concept of why anyone watches TV or plays with a computer instead of reading, going outside, volunteer, etc. He plays a lot, usually with friends online. The thing is - when I am not studying, he is never playing and always up for fun, errands, adventures. He mostly plays when he has free time, and when I don't, and never lets it get in the way of his responsibilities. It is just such an uninspiring activity to me, and that is something we can't really come to terms with. I am working on my aversion to them, and trying to learn more so I can understand his love some more. I think it is mostly my problem.

Please do not continue along this path, it is an engineering travesty.  Look at e-bike and go-kart builds for examples.  E-Bike parts may be particularly well suited to your application.  They are also provided as hub motors which greatly simplifies mechanical design, and are pretty much plug and play.   If you require the positional accuracy of stepper motors you can count pulses on the hub motor commutation hall sensors.  They use mechanical reduction so resolution is sufficient at the wheel.
Red - The rider is equal or faster at that point than the overall fastest completed lap.   Orange - The rider is equal or faster at that point than their own fastest completed lap.   Grey - Neither of the first two (no improvement).
Ward is clearly not a good guy, but not exactly a bad guy either. He's got an agenda and a plan, and it's not aligned with any party. Which makes him way more interesting than a mere villain :D

My mother is extremely anxious and takes it out on the rest of the family constantly. I think the options are for her to see a therapist or make everyone unhappy for the rest of our lives, but she doesn't think she needs help.
If you want to post YouTube videos so badly, make a subreddit for videos.  Or make it more general such as /r/LoLFunny.  It'll be just like /r/Funny except pertain to League content (this is actually a REALLY good idea).   The main subreddit is mainly for official information.  You cannot blame the moderators for filtering out this content (especially since it broke some of the rules placed).   Why fight the moderators when you can just go make your own subreddit with the rules that you want.  If other people agreed with you, they'd follow.  I'm curious as to just how many would (hint: not many).

Due to the stubborn force buys, C9's economy is too fucked up for them to have any cushion to play normally. This will undermine their playstyles, block them from buying necessary grenades, and fuck them up in the head mentally.   Personally, I feel that their line up is already great. I love watching Shroud play, Hikos insane, N0thing been doing very well lately and semphis/sgares are good igls. It's just these force buys limiting their full potential. It isn't even a trouble for me to find these videos lol.

New CO says I have to dump 5 year full ride and can't take classes outside of my Tier 1 Major if I want to keep my NROTC scholarship/guaranteed commission.Advice? P.S. Just to clarify, I intended to use 4 years of the 5 year scholarship before commissioning.

Looks like I dodged a bullet.

Amy is a one of the only companions who is aware of his/her sexuality, and isn't afraid to act on that when she wants, especially after she had just almost died and tries to bone down on what was probably her first sexual fantasy.  She's not the best companion, but I like her firecracker personality more than I like Rose's pining over loving the Doctor so much, but never actually doing anything.  I like the fact that Amy does what she wants, even if that doesn't make her my favorite.  That said, yeah, I like her.  She's fun.  Also, that BBCA intro needs to die. Thank you, internet.

My brother-in-law stole over ten 20 mg tablets of Adderall and possibly about $40 cash from me, and my husband thinks I shouldn't say anything to the family about it because he's "just a kid who did something he shouldn't have done," it could drive their mother to a psychological breakdown, and he doesn't want it blamed on him, as he's a recovered addict. I feel like I should do/say something because I don't feel right just letting it go and pretending it didn't happen. Also, my daughter's birthday is coming up, and, while I don't feel comfortable having him in our home again, my husband wants him there. Can't very well deny him an invite without telling the family what happened.

Catdaddy is a shady company   Update as of Sept 9th--Guys, guys, guys. I was all wrong. I was just informed by CD's FB page that it was indeed a "visual glitch."

Wife and I follow a cycle where things are really good and then she falls hard, but feels that she "deserves" to mess up as a reward for all the time that she is on her best behavior.  My problem is that messing up with her involves things like DUI's and possible killing herself or other people.

I'm confused about my feelings for my girlfriend, but know realistically that nothing will come of it as we are both in high school and she will be moving away in a year or so. She's been a bitch the past week or so, and I don't want it to always be like this, which I'm afraid it will be. Especially because I can't imagine her just forgetting this should we get past it. I don't know want to hurt her by breaking up with her because she's been with so many guys who have hurt her, but I honestly don't know if I want to stay in the relationship. Help?

I probably need some serious help, life sucks. You carry on and try to live with it. Abusive father, disdain towards my mother for things she couldn't control. Slowly getting over it.
your opinion is totes fine. But I really don't think it's that big of a deal. Anal sex isn't inherently bad. Him getting sex for saving her isn't specifically bad. And it was BY FAR not even CLOSE to the worst thing in the movie. That was NOTHING compared to the church scene.

For a while I wanted to set up a little story revolving around the succubus, demon, occult, hell elements. This is a starter that could evolve depending on how we decide to proceed with it. The setting could stay in the real world for most part or proceed into our version of hell, perhaps a balance of both. Let me know what you think would be more fun for you and we will try and make it happen.   I would love for this to be a somewhat detailed story that has some build up and tension between our characters but involves plenty of smut action that isn't just left for sex scenes. Build up and progression always helps the actual sex scenes be more juicy in the end in my opinion.   Roles: Mother (Royal Grand Succubus)/Son (Halfbreed)   Kinks included but not limited to: oral, vaginal, anal, romance, flirting/teasing, abuse, humiliation, con/non-con/faux-rape, breaking, excessive bodily fluids, lactation, watersports, cumplay, breeding, edging and many others.   I love the selection process for reference for the mother, suggesting various pics and discussing the women. We could choose from celebs, models or fictional women to use as visual reference for us both. Let me know if you want me to give you a small list to chose from or perhaps you'd like to suggest some yourself.   Preferred playing platform: Instant messaging (i.e. chatzy, google hangouts, YiM, etc.)   Discussion about specific details is welcome and encouraged!  Looking forward to your lovely orange envelopes :)

You refused to face criticism posed to you, you refused to answer questions, you refused to provide arguments when being asked, and refused to justify your position. You are an unreasonable bigot. You are what's wrong with society. Your comment is proof that democracy is a bad idea and can never work. You make the world a worse place. You should be ashamed of yourself.

The Cthaeh is not the Laplace Demon. The LD can predict THE absolute future. It knows what will happen and will only give one answer (watch tv). Whereas the Cthaeh's ability is to see all  possible  futures. So he would give you two answers. He would say that you would either watch tv or listen to radio. Whichever you do, he'll be right. And he can try to influence whether you watch tv or not. But he cannot do it with certainty.

getting put on anti depressants and just wanting to know more about how they affect us teens
Republicans spent the last few years saying this: Fuck the poor, fuck voters, fuck the poor again, fuck gays, fuck the disabled, fuck women.
of what happened is we thought we found a used car that was perfect for me, but before we paid and signed for it we asked for the service record. On there we found a transmission issue that they had "forgotten" to mention and after test driving the car again we left without it. This was maybe a 2 weeks after I started my medication. Up until that point I was doing really good. I felt better and more motivated. That morning destroyed everything. I ended up going home, went to bed about 2pm and didn't wake up until the next morning on sunday. Sunday I couldn't even do anything I just sat around feeling like crap and I went back to work monday.   Monday I decided I had gotten the sadness and irritation out of my system and wanted to move on and so I tried to and did fine for about another week. It was around that time I broke down again. Not because of the car, but because of how I felt about the situation in general. I realized I was actually really scared by what happened that weekend. The medication had been helping and I was feeling better, but that setback I realized made turn back into the old me. It wasn't even a choice it just happened without any real thought. I realized then just home much I hated being depressed and how much I didn't want to go back to that, but what scared me wasn't that it happened, it was how easy it happened and how little control I had. The difference the medication made was that I was able to use my fear as a motivation, rather then something to depress me further. I knew I didn't want to go back, and while I was really scared by it, looking back on it, I'm glad it happened. I think it was something I needed to have happen. To force myself to admit how I felt about myself. While I've definitely diminished that fear I don't think it's something that will ever truly go away, but maybe that's a good thing.   I had to do a lot of difficult thinking in terms of accepting my problems. I had to finally admit to myself that I wasn't as big a failure as I thought for not being able to handle my depression all these years. The medication made me realize just how big of an anchor depression issue how easily I used to dismiss it as the cause of my problems. I can finally admit to myself that my inablity to deal with it, pretty much since grade school, wasn't because I was a weak person, but because depression is fucking bullshit and does every little little thing it can to sabotage every effort I tried to make. Some people might say that I'm using it as an easy way out. But I'm not. As the months have gone by, and my medication has taken care of things, and my sleep has improved and my general health is better from working out I've had to face some difficult truths about who I am and what faults of mine were being caused by depression and which were active choices I was making. I've had to learn that because the medication helps eliminate my depression that the flaws that remain are mine. When I eat a crappy lunch, I know I don't feel depressed, rather I'm still adjusting to my new eating habits and had a moment of weakness. That's not something I can just say "Oh, well I'm still recovering from depression" and shrug my shoulders. I know it's choice I made and something I have to improve. When I have a day I feel lazy, it's because I'm actually being lazy, not just because I'm dealing with my depression. Ultimately these past months have taught me a lot about who I actually am. It's still a weird feeling, I've spent so long being depressed I didn't really know who I was, I was a stranger in my own body. I've learned a lot about what poor choices i make are actually mine, and what ones were because of my depression and where I need to improve. I think ultimately that's the most important thing I've learned. Depression, whether you feel suicidal or unmotivated or unloved or something else ultimately comes down to the same problem. It steals the ability for you to actually make choices. You think you're making a choice to stay depressed but you're not, that's what depression is and for so many years that's what I didn't realize. I minimized the effect it had on me, telling myself that I was weak and that I was choosing to live like this. It wasn't until I looked back and saw how much the medication changed me that I realized just how bad it fucked me over.   I've made a lot of progress so far, that's true, but I still have a long way to go. Like I said, I don't really have a moral or want this to be some cliche "I did it, you can do it too" bullshit story. It's just something I feel like I have to do. I realize the above was way too long and probably a huge rambling mess. If there's something you want me to talk about, or a question you want to ask me, no matter how personal, go for it. You don't have to ask here, you can PM if you want. I'm not asking for help, I already know what I need to do and am working on it. I guess that's really all I have to say for now unless someone has questions.
if you're trying to push for the 400 or so trophies you need, and you're an early TH9 who can't or won't run 2 hour boost sessions, you can get halfway there for cheap off the back of failed attacks and trophy-droppers.  From there, the name of the game is 3 steps forward, 1 step back, all the way to the top.  Look for those opportunities to win 15 (or more) trophies, make sure you win them, and then bank on only losing 5 between attacks.

If it were about the best interest of the child, then why not let a poor father pay a reduced payment IF the mother can afford the entire cost of raising the child?  The child would not suffer.   If it were about the "principle of thing", if child support is also a type of penalty, tax, or fee then it shouldn't vary  at all .  Can you imagine two people paying different amounts for the same speeding ticket?  A rich man pays $1,000 for speeding 10 mph over and a poor man pays $75 for the same infraction.   The question of if child support is "fair" really requires answering the question "what is the  purpose  of child support".   Then you answer that, the reason behind my arguments should be clear.

you need to do the right thing. and I think deep down you know what that is despite all the excuses you seem to be making to not act.
Weight ratio of a person/bike doesn't mean anything at all really; having a lighter bike helps, along with lighter wheels, but you can't make somebody faster by giving them a lighter bike.   They have to work on strengthening muscle, building muscle, or working on metabolism. Having your metabolism in check allows people to do things like put out 400+ watts for extended periods of time.   Being light helps, but it's the POWER/WEIGHT ratio you should be thinking about, not weight rider/bike.   Here's an article with some more information.

When I do right, no one remembers. When I do wrong, no one forgets." Most "nice" guys are actually nice and want the girls they like to be happy. Continued repeated rejection based off a false operating premise of how relationships work and an inability to distinguish the anecdotal "evidence" for rules like "the friend-zone" or "nice guys" as exceptions to way the actual relationships work forms a reality for people that is hard to break through. Especially when "tough love" is used to do it.

Good. I limit myself to three games to be played at a time. I'm down to one game right now (since PS+ is canceled), so I can add two more. I'll probably add Unit 13 tomorrow night.   Playing: Shinobido 2, (?) Unit 13; waiting for Tales of Hearts R   My Vita is not that bad in backlog because most of the games I can get on it I can already get on PC or PS3. I'm just waiting for some good, new RPGs that aren't hunters games. P4g was eh, and Ys was amazing. Looking forward to Oreshika and skeptical about Hearts R.   Edit: People tend to 'steam-library' themselves on the Vita amazingly. Just because you got a game incredibly cheap or for free, don't obligate yourself or treat it as "I must play and finish this game". Put the games you really wanted to play above a game 'everyone hails amazing' or 'well I have it, so it counts now'. Then play those games you got real cheap or for free later on during your down time. Just some advice though. Take it for what you will.

Struggling to get over an ex, doing the right things and nothing seems to be working.   EDIT: typos
Bf acts like a dick and childish when in argument.  Don't know how to try to change him anymore despite a year of asking him to change this.  He thinks I need to chill out and not get mad.  I think this is unreasonable cos I should be able to tell him something is wrong, as long as I do it properly, even if that takes me awhile.  I accept that he can call me names, but only as long as he eventually stops when I tell him its not right.  But he doesn't.  WTF do I do here?

There is no point in having 7 accidentals in practice.  They exist simply because they do.... because you CAN sharp or flat another note, but there's no legitimate reason since the advent of equal temperament to write in a 7 accidental key.

It touches on some of these issues.

is basically: “I keep asking you to delete all the nipple pics, but there are still nipple pics. Nipple pics: why are they still on internet?”What do you think? I’m a dummy who barely knows what an ethernet cable is (I think it has to do with a download?) and even I know that you can’t really sue Google for the hacked nipple pics. Right? Google doesn’t own the internet, so it’s not like they can wipe the internet clean of A-list nipples. Not to mention the fact that I highly doubt Google is making that much ad revenue off the pictures. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t remember ever clicking on a YouTube video and having to sit through a 30-second commercial for Kate Upton’s naked chichis first.What do you think? But I do appreciate his crazy effort. Marty Singer is threatening to sue Google for ONE HUNDRED MEELLION DOLLARS because horny dudes keep sharing topless cellphone pictures of Katniss Everdeen. You know what? If he does go through with that lawsuit, he’s going to need some help with all that crazy! Marty needs crazy Lawyer-To-The-Pictures-Of-STAHS Svitlana Sangary!

Police function to catch criminals. This does not protect you on a personal level. The legal system as a whole is a deterrent. Social stigma from a peer group is a far more effective deterrent. Everyone needs to be responsible for our socioeconomic policy as a nation as the only real path towards reducing crime. Also, if you depend on police to save you from crime you are foolish.

of all this is that  even if  women unquestionably had it better in every way, there would still be a place for feminism informing the discussion, just as (in my opinion) men have it better in  most  ways, but there is still an important role for the MRM. If you check my post history you'll see I make fun of the MRM here on reddit because I think they are a bad advertisement for the movement (they seem, to me, to be overtly anti-women rather than pro-equality), but in general I am very sympathetic towards anyone who wants to engage with questions about gender and identity, male or female.   NB. You might notice this is a slight departure from my position above - that's not an oversight; I genuinely had no idea this was the case until I went looking for new evidence. So this argument cuts both ways; sometimes us crusty feminists need to reexamine our beliefs too!

Make sure you always know who is where on your lane. Use the high base damage on your abilities early, but once they have double Dorans or BF, stop that or you lose too much hp. From that point on, your one and only job is to grant vision and save anyone you can. If you need to suicide so your carry lives, do it, you're mostly not worth money anyway (like even in good matches you might end 0/2 or 0/3) whilst your carry might even be on a spree.
Theory: Wins/Loss Ration or Total Wins isn't how they measure MM.   And OP, have you considered there are new players who are experience and are getting matched with 'noobs' as well so they have a hard time getting off the ground?  My first 6 matches were with Portuguese speaking people who would all pick melee carries(faceless,spectre,ursa,lifestealer) and yell at me to go mid my first game as icy apparition(never saw him in original dota and wanted something new).  I feel the pain... its just disheartening to think that the feeling won't go away.  Maybe it just means we should make more friends and play with those we deem reliable.

My 14 year old friend hooked me up with another rich 14 year old who wants to start a minecraft hosting company. Said friend has extremely powerful servers. I am 14, have no web development skills, but this would potentially pay off.   So my actual questions:   Do I go ahead and do this?   How would I go about web developing? (if you're not a programmer, a subreddit would be nice)   If you were in my shoes, would you think the company has a chance of making a decent profit?
If you want to learn C++: great! But make sure that you use the right book for it.   If this sounds very off-putting to you, I'd still recommend you to learn a statically and strongly typed language (which implies that I won't recommend any of the usual web-languages). For instance Haskell has countless very vocal fan-boys, so this might be worth a try.

I'm sorry for those of you who thought that I was trying to find an excuse to cheat. . .that was not my intention, the choices of one or the either was always clear.

It's like Liza Lampinelli giving money to charities that benifit gay people when the WBC protest her shows. Maybe that's why everyone is donating.

It is in no way your fault. It may be frustrating but a truly loving partner will definitely overlook this and you two can be happy together. You'll find the right guy with time.
I hope the movement to stop this works because the idea of a flash suppressor for example, which is without a doubt an essential to some(like myself) as this kind of DLC is atrocious.   It honestly would take the game from a very early purchase because honestly I rarely ever buy Day 1 to never purchasing it. Heck if it was a green beret DLC hat to cover up the bright red one I would be fine with it(I also don't care about the Map DLC) but weapons? ammo? suppressors? I'll pass.

My nephew is being taken care of by his god parents while the courts decide if my brother should have custody. They want full custody and they have a lot of wealth and status to play the system. My nephew is likely being physically abused by the foster father. We have no money! What do we do? We need to find a Chicago area bro-bono lawyer or an organization that specializes in these kinds of things...   UPDATE  My brother wasn't initially given custody because the mother didn't tell DCFS about him (She was paranoid he would get custody we think), and he wasn't informed about the situation until a few days before the first court hearing (he was already in their care for a couple of weeks by then).   UPDATE  We are looking at the possibility of a pro-bono attorney via The Chicago Bar Association.

This girl is stalking me and threatens to spread dangerous lies about me that could have legal consequences and come find me if I do not talk to her. I really do not want to talk to her. This has been going on for almost 2 years.   Update: Hey guys, after a period of time (and basically just trying to live my life) I got another passive aggressive text from her basically calling me a horrible, selfish person for not answering her texts, etc. I sent her one last, very long, text back explaining to her that her behavior is extremely unattractive, needy and obsessive. I told her that I no longer am standing for it and I had hoped (for far too long) that simply being nice or passive would give her the hint to fade away. She of course has tried to guilt me and call me several more names but I blocked her call. She IMMEDIATELY wrote a 15-year-old-esque post about being let down by shitty people, blah blah, and tagged me in it. I removed myself from the tag, posted a status on my FB about being obsessively stalked by a girl for two years, deleted her and blocked her. Whether or not she contacts some of my friends, I don't know if she will. It could go both ways. But I'm not sure I really care anymore. If she comes to my house, I'll call the police and call my boyfriend. She's a bully and extremely immature so that's that.  wipes hands  thanks reddit for the extra push!

Not many want to say they're the big life of the party, its more common to hear people describe themselves as the wallflower, as the clam thats waiting to be opened up to a select few, so I think declaring oneself as "Introverted" is not as bold as many think it may be.

Calculus will probably be the most helpful alongside AP Lit. other than that, you're going to be pretty locked into a set schedule as a BME major.   On a side note: Your test scores are plenty good. I got a 2210 on the SAT and a 33 on the ACT, and my subject test scores were only a 730 in US History and a 720 in Math II. As long as you have a good GPA and course load and are active in some extracurriculars you'll be fine. Applying early decision will also help if you decide to do that.
Game recognizes when you're in combat > When in combat, if you switch weapons/items/whatever you have to wait a short cooldown before using the newly selected item. > This means that you can't spam a lava bucket or flint&steel without being punished a bit > your enemy (PVP) has a small window in which they can see what you're about to do and react (example .5 seconds of them seeing you holding that lava bucket and jumping away before you can place it on their feet) > Combat is more fair and strategic because using different items has a downside. Your enemies are given a chance to telegraph what you're going to do before it happens. > The current state of combat (clickclick) makes this system a little clunky but if that was made into proper combat then it would work much better over-all.    That might not have made any sense, so yeah that's my wall of text

had an internship for 1 month then offered full time position, was let go after 4 months. Now currently at a job I am struggling immensely with and not enjoying after 5 months and was mislead about the position. Want to move on.   My question is: Do I now look like a job hopper? Right now on my resume I have my first job with no job title listed, just the company. For my current job, the title and company are listed. Would it be dishonest to list the internship title under the first job and omit the full-time job title I had? Or should I omit the first job/company entirely? Or should I keep it the way it is with no title listed at all then answer any questions they have?   Thanks. Really appreciate any help you guys can provide!
The Story So Far and Counterparts

Had a girl who was my best friend in college.  Went to her wedding & realized I was in love with her.  Many years (and one marriage) later, we are happily married.   (EDIT:  A lot of people are saying I'm shallow for falling in love with her because she was suddenly "hot".  Please understand this isn't the case.  For the sake of keeping our story as short as possible, I oversimplified & left out details.  For example:  I spent all of college pining over my high school girlfriend.  That blinded me to all potential partners, including my future wife.  In addition, we never seemed to be single at the same time.  She was dating somebody, or I was (however halfheartedly).  If she had kissed me in college, we would have gotten together then, instead of 8 years later.)   PROOF AT LAST   Here's the proof you all requested.

Edit: A number of you have pointed out that I wasn't clear about the current state of my injuries. I have an ongoing back problem that is possibly worse than the original diagnosis (according to the orthopedist), am in constant pain, and have limited mobility. To proceed with treatment (with the back as well as my brain) I need MRI scans, which I am not covered for. They are VERY expensive and I cannot afford them out of pocket, but as of now they are essential to my rehabilitation, diagnosis, and determination of work ability. Sorry for being vague. If you need any more specific information to help me, just ask or PM me.   Also, I value the input as to my legal options, thoroughly, and many of your perspectives have really helped me, but I am primarily looking to see what other options could be available to me in an effort to educate my own internal deliberation. Thank you to everyone who has already responded.

The hard part of the relationship is the communication, not making dinner and affection.  He needs to start by giving you more than impersonal single word responses and you need to start by not chewing him out over what you perceive as a slight.  He probably wants to do all that "girlfriend" stuff you listed, but it needs to be appreciated and not expected of him or else he'll just burn out again.
Ever since I updated to Windows 10, my headset would drop randomly for about two to three seconds before coming back online. It would sometimes leave me without sound or a mic, or both/neither. It will ONLY drop when on an online program that has voice chat enabled. The mic does not have to be in use, it can even be muted, and it will still drop, just as long as the program has a voice chat. These programs include Skype and video games. The headset will NOT drop anywhere else, at all, even if I speak into the mic. Again, this only started after I updated to Windows 10

I believe the recon should get a CQC buff, the 1HK is a step in the right direction, but I think there are better options.  First, C4 gives recon more versatility and a much more vital role in the battlefield.  Unlike Support, you don't have infinite ammo.  Second, if there were no 1HK, I think the pistol swap time should be decreased.  Right now, it is actually faster for me to wait the 1.1 second ROF for bolt actions than to swap to pistol (unlike BC2).

Who starts as the 4th line center? Chris Kelly (53-69-122 in 334 Games since 2010/11) or Joonas Kemppainen (46-60-106 in 290 Games since 2010/11)? Both are great at faceoffs and are defensively minded. I would prefer Kemppainen over Kelly since, in my mind, he can infuse skill and speed on that line better than Kelly. Any thoughts?

Your experience will vary depending on your DM, and the players, but if all things are equal, optimized fighters, rogues, dervish, whatever, will not compare to optimized wizards, clerics, and druids (likewise with unoptimized). Even the craziest melee builds, with splat books, PRCs, feats from 5 books, templates, LA buyback -- even those will still have to be tailor-made to challenge/compare to casters.   Edit:  I went and checked because I wasn't immediately familiar with Stonechild. It's an LA+4 race, which is considered unplayable by most players because of how far behind it puts you. Assuming you're not playing with houserules to ignore some LA, you're already behind the curve. If you're using LA buyback, you still can't start dropping that LA til level 18, I think, which means at level 17, you have 11 class levels, 2 racial HD, and 4 LA, meaning you're more susceptible to HD-relevent effects than your party members. As an example, when your party was 12th level, you had 8 class levels. Your evocationalist should've had 12 (unless the player was also using LA for fun). A 12th level Sorcerer thrown at you all as an enemy could use Circle of Death, a 6th level spell. You and the half-drow may both die (there's not an official half-drow race, to my knowledge, so it's probably house-ruled or from a dragon mag or something. Should still have an LA+1 unless seriously nerfed.). The caster isn't even affected because they have more than 9 HD. That's just one of the drawbacks of templates being used to boost fighting classes.   Again, I use templates and melee classes all the time. But I've seen this kind of thing happen far too often. Had a gnoll charger (with another template) in a party that died in exactly that situation - Circle of Death. Almost everyone else was immune. His LA meant his HD was lower despite having the same ECL (meaning it was an appropriate encounter). Then there's the weaknesses that come with a lot of templates, which your caster probably doesn't have. Your stonechild can be banished and is vulnerable to protection against/circle spells (and can't be resurrected). Your half-drow may have the light sensitivity. You're also delaying your class features an extra 2 levels because you have to take two levels of racial hit dice. Fighter offers fewer features, but it means 2 fewer levels in a PRC. All the statboosts and Nat Armor and immunities are fun, but the LA system still doesn't work. The higher your levels go, the weaker your boosts are compared to your party members' class features (like high level spells). LA buyback helps some, but not til high levels when you have as much as you do.   Again, you'll have plenty of fun as a player, but the discussion wasn't whether TOB is fun. It was whether it is a sensible and worthwhile response to the core casting classes since the core melee classes are not balanced.

I feel like I shouldn't withhold sex even when I feel betrayed, but If we break up he might kill himself & I'll hate myself. What do?   EDIT: spelling.
Guy I've been talking to a lot lately does not ask me out
Certain people in the "black" community need to stop perpetuating stigmas and get the hell along.
I broke up with my ex. Whenever my friends hang out with me they invite her along even though they know I don't want to be around her.
these sort of tells don't work all the time. They are, like almost everything in hearthstone, situational

one year relationship going reasonably ok between 32m and 27f, had a little hickup 2 months ago, girlfriend asks to break up after I told her I miss her while being drunk a couple of weeks ago after I hadn't seen her for a week, but says shes confused and doesnt know what to do.   Update:   I couldn't breathe yesterday, I was really stressed and called her, she asked me to meet because she wanted to see me .   One thing led to the other, she said that we can't be together anymore because we can't communicate, that she tried really hard but she can't try anymore because  she's too stressed for all this , she said that she is still confused but she doesn't want to hurt me anymore, she gave me my keys back.   This is too hard for me to type or even think reddit, sorry I let you down

For the times during the semester where my classes overlapped for a few weeks, bringing my hours briefly to a total of 3/4 time or so, will I get paid for those days or not? (MHA) Will I get backpaid books and tuition?   Will the school pay themselves from my loan/grant or the VA?   Would you think I may receive some benefits starting in June for the semester that begins in a couple days? I have not received CoE yet, but have relinquished and my school has submitted my classes/hours, etc.

I work in webdesign because I can focus on the consumer, not only on the enterprise (and because I like it). Possibly making me an hypocrit, but I feel better.
friend basically stopped talking to our friend group, what's left is small talk and huge elephant in the room, there are a few probable causes but it doesn't add up imo, have tried to confront her but she dodges every question, looks like she doesn't want to tell me anything. Don't know what to do.

yes Paul has a couple of funky Christian views, but he doesn't want the federal government imposing them on anyone and would rather people be able to choose for themselves what they'd like as much as possible democratically at a local or state level.

Once horny wife of 4 years does not want to have sex with me any more. Breaks my heart.
I was the Andy Kaufman of my elementary school.
I fell in love with a man who is confused about his sexuality. We tell each other that we love each other. We have sex. Now we aren't living together anymore, not by choice but because he is still in a rehab program. He won't talk to me right now, hasn't called or anything. I am scared that I am losing him. Need advice.   EDIT: I really don't want age to become a factor here. 7 years is really no big deal. If I were 37 and Jimmy was 30, no one would see that as a problem. And just to clarify, Jimmy initiated the romantic relationship, I respected the fact that he was "straight."

Guy fieri is disappointing enough.... But, reading through all these comments, I am truly shocked by how many people defend his gluttonous and extremely uninformative shows. It is truly a sad day for America when the majority seems to be dumb enough to defend one of the biggest assholes in the nation because, well, DID YOU SEE HOW MUCH BACON WAS ON THAT SANDWICH? SWEET BRO! It all boils down to one basic concept (and since we've been mentioning bourdain, we will use him too):   If Anthony bourdain uses his programs to showcase the artistry, passion and culture of local cuisine,  Guy Fieri makes a living off of FOOD PORN.  it's food porn yall, damn

Somehow got into a good school, realized my anxiety, ADHD, and depression were too big of an obstacle to overcome while also trying to tackle coursework, took a year off, tried multiple medications, none of which work consistently, but so far Vyvanse has been the best. Vyvanse helps me focus pretty consistently, but is on and off for mental clarity. I really to have a clear mind while at school and especially with my anxiety and depression which is worsening as school approaches, I need to have this all figured out by August. I am thinking of adding intuniv to the vyvanse to help with mental clarity and anxiety, but my doctor isn’t really all for adding medications for symptoms that aren’t super intense yet. I also have an internship coming up (far far from home) but have no idea if I should go or stay home and figure out the medication stuff. Everything seems to be a struggle for me and I am almost at wit’s end. Pls advise.

The law is simply just choosing words carefully to make it 100% clear what it's saying. You might be an innocent person, or you might be a complete shitbag, but that's not their concern, they're just saying you're  probably  not guilty of the crime you were accused of.

Hitchens makes no sense. When people have control they're tolerant of the opposition because they're secure and feel no threat. When people are vying for control, as they perpetually are in modern Western democratic governments or even when a dictator feels their rule is under threat from domestic or foreign influence, they can never feel secure and always feel threatened and thus have far less tolerance for different ways of life. This applies to all, religious or otherwise.

good dealerships protect YOUR new car by not letting anyone drive it, especially highly anticipated sports cars.   As for the height requirement, don't write it off yet.  The US Consumer Reports video presenter stated that he was just over 6' tall and still had room to wear a track helmet very comfortably.  Based on my experience helmets add 2-3" easily to the tip of your dome.  I've sat in one myself, and at exactly 6' 0" it felt VERY roomy. One of the many video reviews is [Here.](   EDIT:  Forgot to mention the knee issues.  Not sure what country you're from or what model you're considering, but here in the US, the Subaru BRZ comes standard with knee padding on the center console area to prevent such issues.  The Scion FR-S does not.  Beyond the US, the GT 86 offers it as an option, IIRC.

There is no such thing as an essential carbohydrate.
Eggs should be found in the wild and you should be able to choose if you want to "catch"(take) it. Limit the egg carton to 3 of a kind so you can't just horde nine 10km eggs and hatch them all in one 10km walk. Players are no longer burdened by 5km eggs, Niantic still makes money of those who want to hatch eggs faster than others. Everyone wins.

Reply to this thread for a chance to win one out of five keys for Test Your Mind, available on the Wii U eShop.   Winners will be announced some time tomorrow night.   Edit: OK so we have a lot of great submissions!  I want to say thank you to all participants. I am giving this giveaway a solid cutoff time of 8 PM Pacific. After that, I will run everyone through a randomizer and choose five winners.  Any submissions after 8 PM Pacific will not be eligible to win.   Edit:  WINNERS  Congratulations to:     /u/smartojus   /u/UncoChen   /u/CerealDorkVest   /u/SamTheTechGamer   /u/lukec12321     You've all been selected at random and your profiles check out.  You should be expecting PM's from me soon.  I hope you find enjoyment in what I helped to create.   Thanks again to everyone who participated.  I'm sorry I couldn't give out free keys to everyone but there has to be a limit.  I really enjoyed all of your submissions.  We all have so much in common as gamers.  Nothing beats the excitement of getting to play your favorite game, or being introduced to the game that will end up being your favorite game.  I hope you enjoyed participating, and continue to game-on.  Getting to see other people play a game I helped create is what drives me in game development.   Edit:  Texts sent.  Thanks again everyone!

Some people are just straight up stubborn to remember that this is a GAME. Games are made for entertainment, for fun. Some people get so caught up in the mindset of winning that they forget to actually enjoy themselves (I'm guilty af). Go ahead and pick something outside of the meta that might seem a little weird. Have fun! I will say this though, at least make sure you state what it is that'll you'll be doing so no one mistakes you for a troll.

I am a nerd and I came up with my own rating method for quarterbacks, which, as it turns out, weights TD passes most, followed by completion percentage, YPA, and INT/attempt. I still think that completion percentage is the stat on which any meaningful QB rating system ultimately depends, but I concede that it needn't be the most heavily weighted stat for QBs.

fallout 4 character creation is really awesome and pretty, but the SPECIAL and Perk system, as well as leveling, are designed around elements like grinding and repetition, things I try to stray away from when possible.  How different would this game be if we have 40 starting points for SPECIAL and perk ranks aren't locked by level requirements?  Would it arbitrarily be a more "enjoyable" experience?  if so, then why has Bethesda made decisions to the contrary?   I like replaying fallout games, but don't make me grind a character to level 30 who would usually be a level 12 character in fallout 3 or new vegas.   /endrant  /sorry  /walloftext

being diamond isnt an excuse for being toxic
I feel like my girlfriend is controlling and bossy, and that the relationship is one-sided. We’ve had multiple “almost break-ups” and she asked when we were getting married earlier tonight.   What do I do, what can I do? Should I call it off if I have this many concerns or wait until she gets mad enough to want to break up again and just let it happen?   I want to clarify that I love her and care deeply about her, but we have very frequent relationship hiccups that often get blown out of proportion, by her mostly, it seems.   EDIT: I'd like to include that she also frequently talks to her ex (the one from earlier in the post), and once told me that they'll be friends no matter what and that I don't have anything to worry about and that I shouldn't be concerned. I'm not a super jealous person but this gets at me. Again I feel like it's okay for her to do things, but that under the same or similar circumstances that she'd NOT be okay with me doing the same thing she is.

it is too long): don't put too much hope in finding The Truth (but, you might find a better 'truth' that is more satisfying). It would be good if you could be honest with your mum so your relationship could regain some of its former closeness but, it may not be possible (it mostly depends on her). Finally, the metric system isn't so great.   I think it is worth noting that you can be a Christian and not believe everything the bible says is literally true. You can believe in a God that is, in many ways similar to the one your mum believes in and, in some of the bible even but, not belief all of it is literally true (some could be an e/planation of something in a story that isn't true itself but, has something meaningful to say) or, that all of it is the word of God.

Not enough innovation to force publisher to make their game "Unique" as apposed to the same game with different mappings (XB1/PS4/PC)   -Lack of potential customers (due to lack of advertisement and online play)   -Not a traditional "Media Center"     Personal Note:   Don't get me wrong, I love my Wii U, and bought it on launch.

the flaw with your argument so far is that you believe the state has an actual interest in improving the quality of prisons.  They don't.  The state is run by politicians, and their interests are looking tough on crime by voting for ridiculous laws (leading to the high incarceration rates), and cutting actual expenditures on inmates so they don't look bad for raising taxes.

If you really want to be competitive in darts and really want to play as good as you can, your set of darts and the rest of equipment is usually one of the smaller obstacles you'll face. There is no set of darts which is suitable for everyone neither has the price of a dart has anything to do with what it can offer for your game (most of the time...). You should first assess what is hindering your play and then work towards it.   Edit: I've noticed that I haven't answered the question directly at all; so here is some brand recommendations from yours truly:   Harrows:  Fairly experienced company with a very broad range of products. They are really good if you are still trying to figure out what you prefer for barrels etc. since they have so many products to choose from and their prices are reasonable also. Not many pro's use them but that could have something to do with their brand management and marketing, but also with their lack of really superior products that reach to the pros in terms of engineering.   Winmau:  Similarly placed in the darts market like Harrows, they tend to somewhat push their pro players they sponsor more than Harrows. They have some really quality dartboards like Blade series. I personally find their darts selection somewhat limited.   Red Dragon Darts:  Sister company of Winmau, not many people know of them, they only sell online from what I know, have similar quality, maybe a bit lower on some products to Winmau, prices reasonable. Could offer good price/performance.   Bottlesen:  No. I've had couple of friends who bought their darts in hope that they'd justify their prices by quality. Just no, nothing special. Ridiculous prices.   Unicorn:  Large selection of products, very high professional endorsement, people swear by their darts, I have both played (borrowed from friends) with some of their higher and lower end darts, and all seemed like they'd justify their prices.   Target:  I guess similar to Unicorn only with narrower product availability, I've recently bought the Target Carrera C3 21g, maybe I'll do a review when I have the mood. I just checked their website while writing this and there is a countdown saying "Target Carrera". Either their website is outdated and the countdown clock is not working or there are some new Carrera products on their way, which would piss me off seriously, lol. Oh and btw, I've seen some very, very shitty dartboards bearing the name Target, but I don't know maybe it was a knock off, maybe it was some of their less professional/cheaper items, but they were shitty...   thats it for now

Chief is incredibly lucky by being in the right places at the right time, and having Cortana save his ass multiple times. Also, the Didact is insane and all of his actions should be questioned.
yes, it is fear mongering.  And it is that fearfulness that makes women targets. But it isn't simple enough to be fixed with an attitude adjustment. It's the media, it's our parents, it's our culture that needs to change. And I don't even know where to begin with how to fix it.

Yes, but don't take my opinion exclusively.
If the Stormcloaks win, it would likely trigger a cascade effect eventually leading to the total collapse of the Empire. The Dominion wouldn't even have to reignite the Great War, just sit back and watch the empire of men crumble before gobbling up the broken pieces of Tamriel one by one.
you can do it, just figure out your motivations and know you're in control.

Toxicity in ranked games leads people to get mad and be toxic towards futher people. Many try to execute self-administered justice but this doesnt help either.

Boyfriend may or may not have broken up with me due to wishy-washy and conflicting texts/actions, has yet to tell me "what's going on with us" in person as promised three days ago, hasn't told me what I exactly did wrong, did his normal goodnight/love you routine (with the love note and t-shirt to smell) the night before alluding to a break up via text, and has not talked to me in person yet.
long distance boyfriend is not inviting me to do things, and is always doing them by himself or with other friends. I feel neglected and I don't know if I should talk to him about it. I don't want to start our first argument over me being a needy girlfriend. Do you guys think I am being too needy and I should calm down? Should I talk to him about it?

YouTube has such little oversight that someone who stole from an artist can not only get away with it, but that thief can then steal from me. It's things like these that make me question whether or not I should even bother with YouTube. Why should I try and make it on YouTube when I keep getting shot down on every turn.

All the MTX are aimed mainly at cosmetics and allow runescape to generate income that doesn't directly affect gameplay. It could be 100000% worse like it is on other games making it PAY-TO-WIN with weapons/items/instant skill levels.It helps prevent RS from having to get profit from other means such as Advertising, increasing membership, downsizing staff (reduces the updates/patches).  Overall it's a win-win for everyone. You get AWESOME, WONDERFUL, and AMAZING game to play at low price with the expense of others paying the cost to have it by buying a cool outfit to wear that doesn't hurt your gameplay by any means.
Should i try and be nice or mind my own business?

Stop caring about others, if you wish to actually rely on your teammates, start playing Ranked 5s or Normals with friends. Cause i think this is more of a mental problem than your skill stopping you.
Want to break up because he think he's wasting my time, and he's not worth it.
Sorry man, but your points kind of fall flat, except where Sony's outages were concerned. That was pretty messed up. And, okay, some people will make great use of Kinect, and what have you. It just seems like the One is trying to take over the entire living room whilst the features in PS4 largely focus on what's really important... You know, the games. Sure, it has netflix too, and you don't even need a plus subscription to use it. But it's more of a happy side-note than something that should be hyped. That's I think why most people aren't too excited, or are even being negative about the One. Who wants to pay more money for stuff you'll never use?

Met a person at the beginning of the year, and became friends. When we first met, I was super nice (and seemed shyer and more innocent than I am). Since then, we've got to know each other better and I've been a little less nice and more real. While drunk, she said that I wasn't a nice guy (essentially), and I don't know what to read into that. Want to know if I've been too mean, and opinions on what is going on.

Had a good relationship with ex but brokeup due to long distance. Can't move on due to a plethora of fears. I'm scared I'll never find anyone I can connect with so deeply again, scared I'll never find someone who will be as sweet and attentive towards me again, scared that I won't ever be able to move on, also scared I made a huge mistake by breaking up with him. Please tell me I'm just being irrational and that everything will be okay? :(
Imagine you have a hole where your nose should be, and that hole is filled with a fleshy glove, with the fingers of the glove reaching into your head. Imagine blowing the glove outwards (turning it inside out in the process). Now, imagine that there are smaller gloves on the tips of the first glove's fingers, and so on, and so on.     E: "Nose" is taking some liberties. It's more of a sucking tube (think like an elephant's trunk).

Eva Hess was an 'emotional' artist in a period when men would look down on her for being 'frail' for doing so, and she didn't care what assumptions people would make about her based on how she talked about her art. And that's awesome :D
which Brass has seemed to rephrase a bit, but the idea is the same; what's more important to you, the community, or your individual OC/s?   For me it's the community. If that means that I'm reinstalling skype and writing missions for people in LN or tWOL then I am, yay! If that means that I lose Mal to the fates and have to make a new OC, then so be it. I'm willing to put in the work alongside everyone else that wants to see this place thrive, but 7 or 8 of us out of a community of 100 (guessing) isn't enough.

actual question:   If PokeVision is calling the game API to tell it there's a player where I am scanning, on top of myself actually going there.. could this lend any substance to theory that Pokemon appear where API calls occur? Or: Can you stimulate spawns using PokeVision?   Also: this is a purely anecdotal, but I will say that I have been obsessively refreshing PokeVision on this same spot for several days, and the amount of spawns has NEVER been more then 7-8 at one time.. I just refreshed as typing, and there's 20 Pokemon there.   edit: found typo.

Infinity Edge is a core item while the Bloodthirster is situational. The latter costs less but the former does more damage. If you are constantly dealing damage then IE is better. If you can't survive early/mid game long enough to do damage then rush life steal. You will probably get IE either way permitting the game is a long one. This is my full opinion.

Asked a girl I'm friends with about her friend, turns out her friend is single but shes into certain guys and thats not me so I just pretty much said nvm because of that reason. Never talked to her friend and only have seen her like twice and I told her that. I was just asking, didn't make it seem like I was crushing over her friend because I wasn't.   Now I want to ask the first girl out since I've always wanted to see of anything could happen with her since I met her a year ago. We arent 100% compatible but I want to take a chance cause why not? If I get rejected then I would be able to find out what I could improve since she is the honest type.   If I haven't competely screwed it up by asking about her friend, what can I do? I have her number and MIGHT see her Tuesday.

Guy expressed interest in me under circumstances that made me uncomfortable. He has been trying to establish/maintain a relationship/friendship over the course of 5 years and doesn't seem to get the hint that I'm not into him.

But it is an insight into how Gumi may be influencing our perception of whether this event was a success or not.

is that I think it's generally a pretty neat idea but I'm not sure if the "scores" community will be particularly interested in it. It is definitely fun for casual/offline play, however. One thing that particularly impressed me with this feature is that the music engine was actually very good at determining a "fitting" musical note for every time a user strums. This means that you can almost literally play whatever and it will sound fitting. Of course, you will lose points if you deviate against their guidelines. However, one concern/criticism that I have is actually the transition after the solo has ended. In some songs (I have noted Boston's "More Than a Feeling" and "Tribute" by Tenacious D), many players have elected to effectively "play whatever" and afterwards, the transition back to normal notes is very sudden, and that seemed very weird to me. In general, I did have a feeling that the Freestyle Guitar Solo feature is more effective in "fast solos" than stuff that is slower. >  > Overall, I had a great time in PAX. It was a pleasure meeting with Eric Pope and the rest of the Harmonix crew, and there is a group photo of us. Do check out our interview with much of the Harmonix team, as we (@Seattle RockBand Group) have interviewed several of their members. From what I have seen, I am very optimistic that this will be at least a good game. It does feel a lot like we are going back to Rock Band 2 and starting from there. >  > If you guys have any other questions, please feel free to ask away. >  > With much love, > Alexander >  > Oh, I also tried Guitar Hero: Live. There wasn't as much to see there. >  > Some other quick points: >  > - I can confirm that "The One I Love" was on the PAX Prime setlist. I cannot confirm or deny if it is going to be on-disc or will be an eventual DLC. I did not see a "Sort by Game" option > - The most overplayed songs from experience were "Tribute" by Tenacious D and "Uptown Funk" by Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars. > - I was told that Individual Track Speed had a bug and needed to be fixed. > - I did not see Band Tour Mode. This is the main reason why I'm not completely sold on the game, but from what I have seen, I am still very optimistic that this will still be a good game. > - There is no Freestyle Bass or Drum Solos. However, I did note that there exists a bass solo in "Metropolis - Part 1 'The Miracle And The Sleeper'" by Dream Theater.
grade rushing QB's on dropbacks not passer rating. if your game is 99% passing (and 1% kneel downs) like PM passer rating is fine because he doesnt run anyways. if your game includes lots of rushing, grade on dropbacks.

mom has always been leery of my relationship, today tells me that I'm selfish and only care about myself for spending time with my girlfriend and not at home.

you are stretching the truth, to egt media on your device you either have to use iTunes, to only app allowed to sync stuff to an iDevice, or pay apple either to buy your music or t use iTunes match/iCloud   edit: oh, and your argument about playlists and the syncing feeling slow is just laughable.   First of all: you know what's slow? syncing with iTunes. [Even major iPhans admit that](   Second: playlist syncing is supported by most players that manage playslists and do Android syncing: DoubleTwist, Songbird, Winamp, ... Before you mention this makes Android just as bad because you need an installed app on your PC to sync playlists: if you want playlists synced, you need a music app in which you have those playlists to have a playlist to sync. With Android, even with playlists you have a shitton of options to chose from. So again, imo Android wins at syncing by a very wide margin.

If you play a decent looking game with a flashlight and think, "This isn't scary," you only know the half of it.     UPDATE:  A great case in point of why I hardly ever bother to submit anything.  What possible motivation could anyone have to down vote this, thus making it less likely that anyone would see it?  Well, they're making it less likely that anyone would see it.  More than likely, this happens to anyone who is not some favored submitter rather than because the content that they submit is without value.  This content certainly has value.  The only other alternatives are worse: The down-voters don't want others to see this because they simply don't want others to have fun, they can't stand that somebody else may have a different opinion from them, or they bury this so that they can say the same thing and take credit for pointing it out.   Participating in Reddit as anything more than a commenter is discouraging unto pointless.  It really sucks that the community has degraded so badly, and I suspect that with submission discouraged so heavily, there's a lot of great content that the community misses out on.  I wish that somehow I could return to the days when redditors weren't assholes.  I can't wait until the great reddit replacement comes along, which will undoubtedly be an awesome community until once again the drooling, egotistical masses swarm in and ruin it as they have done with so many other things.   I hope the people who bury stuff like this catch anal herpes.  I could bet real life money that in the next few days I will see this same thing in meme form upvoted to the front page of /r/gaming, and I am 100% certain I would profit.  Assholes.  You're ruining this site.  Please go back to Digg, or better yet, die in a fire.  All I wanted was to help people have fun, so FUCK ME, RIGHT?  No, my jimmies are not rustled.  I'm not mad.  I just honestly think those people are disgusting human beings.

Sorry, even with max damage and optimization for the level, the galvanizer took more shots and required more stasis than the chain lightning gun did.   p.s. my first hunch was that you underestimated the firing speed of the chain lightning gun. try maxing out its damage and rate of fire and trying it out again, you might like it.

Due to the slight change in the show as to when the dragon glass was buried: Show- Bloodraven buried it years ago Books- Coldhands buried it This slight change may also confirm that there will be no Coldhands in the show (and yes, I have seen the interview with the actor who plays Sam who already confirms that he won't feature).

Kog's increased range and decreased mana costs make him a better harasser.   Also, while we're discussing Kog'Maw, I'd like to add that whenever I look at his kit I always see him as a sort of anti-tank adc. With the new changes, he can use his debuff from a distance, which means he harasses with %health damage as well as reducing resistances, so he can shred a dangerous frontline easily and fairly safely if he stays at a decent distance.

Dad molested and made me things i want uncomfortable with, he is very controlling and gets very angry. Ran away from home, told school counsellor, police/social services get involved. He went to jail. Been about 3 months since. I am very happy and so is family without him, but mom is extremely manipulated by him. Don't know if she is going to leave him. She is scared to. I really don't want him back in my life. I just want to live with mom and brother in our home.   Advice?   Edit :  I guess I should have explained better. I reported what my dad did to me. About half a month later he was brought in to be questioned, and then he was brought to jail. He has been charged with 3 things, all of them being sexually related. He is still in jail, his next court date is in march. But social services called recently and said that he COULD be released with no conditions or with. This is all stuff I have heard from family. Basically, none of us know what is going to be happening with him, yet.

is talk to someone they respect about the situation, see if you can get some help from them. If that's not an option, tell your parents that you want to see a counselor. If they don't take you, then you have no choice, you either have to suck it up or move out.   Best of luck, update us!

The long and the short of it is, 50/50 or bust.  Draw up a rotating chore schedule, with daily, weekly, monthly expectations, and split it up fairly, with each person truly examining themselves to see that they aren't being spiteful or just plain lazy.  Be accountable and be giving.  If you guys can't run a household together, and be solicitous of your partner in an equitable and loving way, you're certainly not ready to be married.

Woke up to several missed calls/messages from the only girl I've been interested in since I knew they existed, while she was likely drunk, horny and/or lonely from Valentines' Day.   Update:  Well...   I messaged her on Facebook last night "Sorry i didn't answer. Had a busy weekend and barely had time to charge my phone. How was Saturday? xx"   Then just boring as shit, generic conversation; "good thanks, you?" etc... It was at about this point that I realized why I've been single all these years, I'm not very good at talking to girls, especially when sober. At the end, I foolishly answered a question and closed the conversation, so I don't think she felt any real need to reply back.   Now, a few weeks ago I had got drunk and messaged her on Facebook. Then I got her number and she invited me out for her birthday with some friends. Then today she just suddenly says that her mum's booked a surprise holiday to Spain, so that's not happening either.   The thing is... this happens all the time. Whenever I've asked her out/to a party etc... it's always "my mum's making me do my homework" or "I need to see my grandparents", or "we're staying at a caravan"... always an excuse.   Fuck this, I'm done. I haven't even bothered to reply yet.

Go back and read it, or you'll be missing out on money. Why trust me? That's up to you! these are just the tips I use. I've been making around 10-20 dollars a day and have not been on mturk for more than 3 hours a day in over a month.  Hits totals  (sorry, not giving the requester's name!)   EDIT: A lot of people commenting are seeming to only read a few of the bullets and missing the points.     Nowhere in this post did I tell people who are new to Mturk to do 0 hits their first few days. I told them to do low paying batches their first few days because the ONLY way of making decent money on Mturk is by being qualified to do HITs that meet the fair pay $0.10/minute. The ONLY way to find many of these HITs per day is by having at a minimum 100 HITs approved.       I got this in the comments "Honestly I think OP is a bit off...The BEST way to find them? Use /r/hitsworthturkingfor" Which is in bullet 8. Please read the post before commenting.       The end of the article "Why trust me? That's up to you! these are just the tips I use. I've been making around 10-20 dollars a day and have not been on mturk for more than 3 hours a day in over a month." Nobody is making you use these tips. My first few days on Mturk I did maybe 4 or 5 hits that paid a dollar but took nearly an hour to complete. Now I'm making anywhere from 10-20 dollars on average and even up to 30 dollars a day with under 3 hours of work.       Qualifications (again) when searching for HITs without that box checked I found the "Label 3D orientation of Heads" After learning the keyboard shortcuts I was doing them in under 3 minutes with fairly high accuracy, I made a mistake here or there but they all got accepted. I made 16 dollars that hour until they soft blocked me. HubPages was an easy batch of 15 which required qualifications. The best was the qualification test for a batch of 20 two dollar hits that took less than 2 minutes. You can make decent money with the box checked, yes I'm not disputing that. But you also lose a lot of opportunities without it.     EDIT: I see a few of the comments regarding times to Turk. Don't be discouraged if you can't work during these times. I spend a few minutes at all hours of the day on all days of the week and have never encountered a time I did not find HITs. For reference I am in CST. The last couple HITs I posted to HWTF have been from the hours of 12AM to 3AM, 1.50/3 min, 3.00/8-20 minutes (depending on length of video to watch) don't stop Turking because the so called "best times" aren't available to you. It's all about finding the right HITs.  Side note: A lot of the HITs I post to HWTF are >500 or >100 with 95% or above approval. So it is important to get your numbers up!   Sorry about reposting this, I posted it around a year ago (user mustybriches) but someone I pissed off in the comments section on a different sub kept spamming my account and trying to get onto it, so I deleted it.

an "account" is not a real thing until you start using it.   [EDIT] Furthermore, there has never been such a thing as a "gmail" account. Gmail is a service, and you don't have an account with a service - you have an account with a company. Google is the company. And I'm very puzzled as to why these complaints have only started popping up recently.   Consider maps, for example. As far as accounts go, maps is very similar to youtube. Just like youtube, you can use it without an account (looking at maps/watching videos), but it has features that you can only use with an account (saving places and custom maps/uploading videos).   And just like with youtube, if you only had a gmail account, you were always able to use the account-only features of google maps. No one ever had to sign up for a "google maps" account, and no one ever complained about it.

If you have an interest in setting a NYR, make sure it’s a theme that will be beneficial to your values with concrete and well-defined goals. Identify your success and failure criteria, what remedial punishments can be applied to get you back on track effectively, and make sure to hold yourself accountable by writing down your progress! Last but not least make sure to actively contemplate your experience and the value it’s bringing to your life!   -e-vaughn

I still care a lot for her, but with the disagreements and arguments we have been having, I don't want to be leading her on and I think the smartest thing to do is break up. But I am scared and nervous and need advice.

Respectfully request you can attempt the Shodan grading in the near future and spend some time at 1st kyu prior to that. Skipping ranks should not be based solely on skill and prior experience but commitment to your training and your dojo. People who turn up every week and work hard deserve prompt promotion in the kyu grades.   But good luck, by the sounds of it you will do well, and don't worry about what other people will think. It sounds like they are all proud of you and you should turn your mindset around to think I will be the best possible karateka I can for my otegai.

Found out the guy I was seeing for 2 months was married and had an infant son. He doesn't know I know even though we've broken up because I found out he was married. How do I respond? Should the wife know her husband cheated?    Update: I've assembled a letter that is basically verbatim of what I wrote below. I added some specific dates and things for reference and included excerpts that should provide incontrovertible proof that it was indeed her husband. The plan is to send it tomorrow. Since I don't know their new address, I'm sending it to their old one, which I found on her FB which is public, and hopefully, it will be forwarded. Naturally, I'm nervous but I can't wait to be done with this once and for all. The shock is still there and overall, I'd say I'm handling everything quite well. Thanks for all of your help. If I hear anything further, I will write a separate update post.

I'm at a point of being too previously casual to have a solid spot in a Mythic guild, yet very bored of multiple casual/semicasual guilds that don't have a solid team or fall apart weeks later. I just want to enjoy raiding again!
is this: I felt uncomfortable and unsafe flying at the airstrip vs. the regional airport, I felt like my CFI was not preparing me adequately and I felt there huge gaps in my training and knowledge, my CFI seemed to be trying to milk extra money off of me by refusing to set any progress goals or even a time frame for the checkride, and it was all causing my flying experience to suffer.   >I chose to switch to the flight school here in town which, while more expensive, addressed all of those concerns. It was the best decision I could have made, I feel so much safer flying at the regional airport, I am MUCH more prepared now as a pilot, my skills have seen rapid improvement since switching, and my CFI is very student-focused and goal-oriented.   >However, it was a steep cost increase, both in there's an initial investment of $900 to become a member of the flying club, and that the planes rent at $115/dry + fuel, and the instructor is $50/hour.   >I had $1800 in savings that I had planned to use flying places after I finished my license, so I did the math and figured that, scraping pennies, I would be able to make it so long as I was as close to 40 hours as possible (42 being the cut-off point).   >Life took that as a challenge. In early July, a medical issue unexpectedly cropped up that needed to get taken care of, and cost me $650 to do so. Nothing that would impact my medical or my flying, but could potentially impact both down the line if left unchecked. I then had 2 very unexpected bills come up that I had to pay, all-in-all taking me down to $250 left at 38.7 hours, which is at least $500 short of what I need, and I have no other options at this point.

lesson learned: If you are truly DT, you can have a good chance of getting her to abort even if she's originally completely against it. But you have to play the long game and be willing to sink to any low. You must truly assume formlessness and modify your strategy based on what you see getting results and what doesn't. One can spend their whole life analyzing DT behavior in a sandbox, but when you go through a process like this, it will actually kill or severely cripple certain parts of you. You have to accept that as the price, and this is why you'll only get through this process if you are really, really compelled and motivated to not lose this war at all costs.   After all, this other than biology is a big part of why women win these alimony / CS / baby / etc battles. They are willing to go nuclear and burn your whole life if it suits them, but you are not willing to do the same. She is not a DT, but she is impelled by biology, hormones, media, friends, and her hamster to be effectively DT at least in terms of how she sees you. If you do not match that, you will be submitted to her agenda. It's that simple, there has to be a victor, and it's not going to be you unless you are willing to go to depths that she cannot imagine you would go to.*

Demo is too good to get funding because it looks like a finished game, got it.   We took a look at various kickstarters over the last few months, and came up an average number of what similar games were asking for, and we made a budget of what money we needed to FINISH the project.  That is what kickstarter is for, you ask for money you feel is needed to complete the project or to pay for things you need.  We looked at kickstarter projects geared towards the mobile platform, as well as games geared towards the PC platform and the average asking price was between $8k and 12K.  Our values were generated from a budget of mostly software license and hardware and a sound guy.   I'll just leave these here, various projects that got funded that you as a research analyst would say had no chance to earn their goal yet they did.   So just numbers aside, your project, if you were to launch it tomorrow, what is your budget breakdown?

Student needing advice on the best way to contact people for internship opportunities.
No matter how you calculate the water rates, if the connection fee includes all of the overhead costs, so that the water company doesn't have to raise rates if people use less water, then people who use less water pay relatively more.   What's the solution? To charge people in the higher tiers more than the overhead rate for the overall system, say, bill Richie 75% instead of 66% overhead on his water over 50 units. The problem with this method is that it is clearly [ILLEGAL]( It may even be illegal to have tiered pricing schemes at all.

Hi, this is me, Optidox.   -Equalization of shotguns and snipers is neutral at best.   -Shotguns have a lower skill barrier to entry, but plateau and have a lower skill-performance ratio than snipers for awhile.   -A multitude of factors have contributed to snipers currently having dominance, especially at high level play (alternatively, defensive shotgunning is the only other viable secondary play in sweats)   -A hostile environment is no larger a factor than an unchanging playstyle in snipers getting good   -A few small changes could rebalance snipers with the rest of the weapons in the meta   Edit: I totally agree with Pwad about AA. It's working perfectly, but other changes must be made to reflect what perfect is for this game.   See you in the crucible friends,   Opti

Here, Ashara could have been the plan to hide Jon if needed, but once the plan was no longer needed, Ashara disappears.

Now that it's repaired, they decided I don't deserve the car, anyway, until I've fully payed them back for the repairs.

Learn to read body language. Pay attention to your own and others.  Be compassionate to other people.  Try to make sure your conversational partner is enjoying themselves.  Find common interests, and share similar emotions to develop a sense of connection. Story telling is about sharing a feeling with another person.  Emotional impact comes first, content is secondary.   (1) As a rule of thumb: Hold eye contact for as long as you feel friendly, and it isn't distracting you.  Too much eye contact is intimidating, too little is subversive.

Okay, so statistically, it came out to be a range of 62-70 points, which is pretty good. It averages at around 35 goals, 31 assists for a total of 66 points. In my opinion, I don't think he will get that many points and that he will be around 60, maybe something like 30 goals, 30 assists. Although I wouldn't complain with more than that.

Firmly tell them to stop making the comments. Whether they do or not, work on finding the happiness and satisfaction  in yourself . You said yourself that you've made great improvement and that your confidence is coming back. That is abso-freakin'-lutely amazing. Do not give them the power to make you feel bad about yourself. Once you hold your head up high and let your confidence shine, people will take note and have nothing ill to say.   And people who judge others' appearances are most likely insecure about their own appearance and are projecting their own insecurities onto you. It's a personal thing that they need to deal with, not you.

If it were an actual problem, you would present conclusive research and not the disconnected facts of "cigarettes in high concentration kill aquatic life" and "cigarettes are carried into run-off."  Neither of those statements mean anything until you link them.  Until you can conclusively make the statement, "cigarettes are carried into run-off at a concentration that resembles the toxic concentrations studied in the laboratory."

that's a good point. Maybe we are born with empathy, or at least an early capacity for it, and maybe children would develop certain universal morals. I always kind of thought we developed morals based on what works for society and what doesn't (social contracts and all that), and passed them on, but maybe that isn't true at all.

my guy has a tiny wang, wat do?   edit: the small penis combined with what seem like really large, swollen testicles concern me the most. is that a potential medical problem? I ve seen a few penises and stuff in my day but nothing like this.   edit 2: I'm feeling better about telling him and i think it's my only choice at this point. he deserves to know. does anyone have any idea if it maybe a hormonal problem?  I've done a little bit of looking and looked through the "penis gallery" someone linked to and I don't see anything like the extremly small penis and very large testicles there. His testicles are at least three times larger than anything on that site. What does that mean?

never had a girlfriend, never touched a female, have always had deep-seated anti-feminist sentiments as well as issues with the notion of women being entitled to alimony, and am now almost in my 30s and pursuing a career; family and members of society are now pressuring me about not wanting to get married, saying that I'll be miserable for the rest of my life. Would like to know if that's how it usually works out.

GIT basically lets multiple people access a central chunk of what is usually code, and make alterations to it without stepping on each others toes. ^Edit to add there's a bunch of other stuff GIT lets you do, but simplified its a way of being able to track changes to a document with multiple users messing with the document, including making branches of the main document for individual development.   GITHUB is just a website that works using GIT that has a lot of code. Most of it is opensource, and the idea there is that if you wanted to add some paragraphs from someone on GITHUB, you would just check out their GIT repository and add it to your document, more or less.

the real question is why so many anti-gay laws are passed and the issue played up in the Russian media so much; the answer is, because the gov't is a fraud and uses religion, gays, 2014 Olympics, 2018 World Cup and other crude, cheap populism to distract the people from any actual agenda.

The authors of the press release and this post got it wrong.  This isn't an interesting discovery about potential tomato yield; it's about the behavior of obscure genetic phenomena primarily of interest to geneticists and developmental biologists.   If you really wanted to improve yield via plant architecture, dozens of mutants have already been identified with a wide variety of effects.  The problem with these, generally, is that more isn't always better.  Most things in biology are tradeoffs, so blindly making more or bigger of something usually comes at a cost, whether to the robustness of the plant, the quality of the fruit, or some other factor.

Nintendo needs to make a Wii 3 with hardware on par with this gen, that keeps the Gamepad or introduces another iteration of it, expands on the Pro Controller and drops the Wii Remote, because the Wii Remote fucking sucks.  Then  they should focus on getting 3rd Party AAA titles- that will make them a threat to the other consoles and reform their image as a "Casual" or "Kiddie" company.   If there's one thing we can learn from the PS4 v Xbone war, it's that an online opinion can dramatically shape the sales of your console.

Plastic sucks, but doesn't dent.  Mg alloys somewhat better than plastic, but block wireless signals too much.  Aluminum is far superior in almost every way, but more expensive.   Some additional random info, if I haven't managed to bore you yet     If you wanted to strengthen the current aluminum unibodies, I'd suggest adding about 2% vanadium - vanadium is quite expensive, but Alu-Ti-V alloys are used in jet engine single crystal turbine blades because of how ridiculously rigid and strong/light they are.     I would  love  to see apple do single crystal unibodies out of Al-V-Ti superalloys, but a BMG type liquid metal alloy is the next logical step, because purified vanadium costs $22,000.00 per Kg. o_o.     Bulk metallic glasses (like LiquidMetal™ which apple has bought rights to for consumer electronics uses) are great, because they are rigid like plastics (they don't dent) and are EXTREMELY rigid - almost as much as sapphire or diamond, and strong - more so than titanium and steel. They are a material of the future, though, because we still haven't really figured out how to cool them while molding quickly enough for large scale objects - this is needed to make unibody MacBooks or iPhones out of them. The only reason that SIM ejector tool is liquid metal is because it's thin enough that it can be supercooled during processing, and that itself was a trial run. we'll get there but it'll take time.     Vanadium hardened steel is used in critical engine components like the crankshafts of almost every single car out on the road today.       Hope this helps :) Feel free to ask more questions :)   edited several times to fix grammar, spelling, and formatting

if itemization was re-focused, we could see Yasuo's intended role (melee fighter/carry) be built into, rather than be an intrinsic part of a champion that can then be further powered up with stats from items. This would give the designers the freedom to give "Yasuo-style" (interesting, complex) play to all champions, rather than having a huge discrepancy between "the Yasuos" and "the Sions" at a champion kit level, or a statistical level.
Need to ask some serious questions about why you really feel this way.  Once you pin point that, I think you'll have a better idea of what you should do.

don't let dramatic (wo)manchildren volunteer. don't ignore drama because that won't make it go away.   i really want to help out animals but i don't want to deal with that kind of bullshit ever again. unfortunately there's pretty much no way of asking shelters "hey, you don't have any drama queens, do you? jw so i don't waste your time!" there was another crazy volunteer there (i'm pretty sure she didn't think i was good enough to handle the cats.) but she was nowhere near as bad as  this  girl.

My mom is a narcissist, and extremely clingy and controlling, and I don't know what to do about it because I'm highly empathetic, and it makes me feel terrible to watch her suffer... Which seems to be basically whenever I don't do exactly what she wants me to... If I let her suck me into her world, it would make my life hell. But she has cancer, and she might die, so... Fuck.

Mom gets sick 4 years ago, emergency surgery to remove intestines found lumps in lungs. 4 years later (today) lumps are cancerous - surgery to remove them. Mom and dad alone in hospital - please send cards.   EDIT: infection was C. difficile not diverticulitis.   EDIT II:  My mom's name is Linda, dad's name is Dale.   UPDATE:  Mom's cancer went really great!  They were able to remove the cancer, and biopsies of the nodes came back.  It's almost hard to believe, but she's cancer FREE!!!  I never thought I'd be glad about her emergency surgery 4 years ago, but that is what has saved her life today!   Thanks everyone for the cards!  They are trickling in a few at a time and she LOVES reading them and can't wait for the mail to arrive each day!!!

Post-Hit Delay reduction is mostly breaking the game for people like me and it is giving people with less latency an incredible (in the long run) advantage while in game. I'm not the first one to say it, nor was I the one to report it or calculate it, but I can now explain to myself WHY I missed all those skill shots and WHY I kept being burst down by about 4 Thanatos (and friends) today in different games.

What awesome compliment/accomplishment/little thing have you experienced lately that made you feel on top of the world.
of my story, is that not every part of every game is for every player. blizzard stated during production that inferno was for the more dedicated players. so if you are not prepared to put in the time/effort, you are not entitled to clearing inferno.   otherwise we'd get people paying $60 then loading up the game with 5 level 60's in full ilvl 63 gear and all waypoints then a message saying 'do what you want, have fun!'   you want to play act 4. earn it.

i think, from a new user of this subreddit prespective, everything has been a great experience for me. I have engaged in conversation with many wonderful people with like-minded interests, and this subreddit has helped me network a little easier with experienced streamer's that have been in my shoes. its a place i can go to ask questions, or answer them. I strongly suspect this will become far more critical as twitch gains popularity.   enabling downvotes could be a finicky thing. I personally would probably leave it as-is.

the same system that determines what an arbitrary characteristic like anatomy should mean in the world and how that meaning should affect a person's life does the same thing with skin color, and while patriarchy and white supremacy and other supremacies do operate on their own, they support and inform and perpetuate each other in important, if often subtle, ways.   I have read that some feminists want to move away from the term "intersectional" because it implies fixed points and distance, i.e. if i'm at the intersection of this road and that road that's the one and only place I am. Jasbir Puar has proposed "assemblage" feminism as a term that simultaneously acknowledges the specificities as well as the commonalities of different people's experiences of oppression. ETA: Jasbir Puar's essay "I'd Rather Be a Cyborg than a Goddess" deals with this proposal

I'm a hypocrite that's complaining about people complaining, but I'd like for people to be able to filter out complaint posts if they want to. People post complaints as questions (BUNGIE WHY??) or under misc, and there's good stuff I'd miss if I filtered those out.

GF wants oral after piv if she doesn't orgasm. I don't like to do it, she won't do it for me if I don't orgasm.   How can I bring this up with her, without sounding judgemental or causing an argument?

I am all for implementing methods to let players bring others to justice™. It could really enhance the world and could be an entry point that makes pvp more accessible for the average mmorpg player.

I messed up a lot in my relationship. My gf broke up with me because I didn't trust her completely about her hanging out with her ex then she almost immediately started dating him. She is too arrogant to admit any of her wrong doings and is blaming everything on me and calling our entire relationship a waste of time. I can acknowledge that both of us have reasons for feeling the way we do which is causing me to basically not know how to feel about anything or know what I should have trusted.

super-realistic suits can run nearly twice the price of cartoony suits due to the effort involved. Even if we could all afford them, certain fursuiters would not want them as realism does not mesh with their style of performance.   Oh, and as you're an outsider, I've made a few generalizations. There are a few more "categories" of suits other than toony, semi-realistic and realistic. Also, the pricing everywhere varies wildly. It's  possible  for a toony suit to cost several times more than a realistic suit depending on the maker, intricacy of design and market conditions, it's just on average, this will not be the case.
Clingy girlfriend is no longer clingy and wants time to think, how much should I give her?
Guy at work with the mental function of a 7 year old is being physically abused by a guy at work.   ** UPDATE; I told one of my good friends at work what was going on and she was furious as well. She told me to go tell a manager now and deal with everything else later. Annnnd that's what I did. The office manager and I called HR together and they will be in tomorrow to get statements and witness conversations! My friend at work TODAY said she saw John messing with Ryan jumping towards him like he was trying to scare him which caused Ryan to flinch like he was going to get hit. So now we have two statements and hopefully we will never have to deal with John again. He's a sorry excuse for a person.

Why do I get more harassment from women for being open and me when women are supposedly the ones that want more equality and acceptance?   This post might be worded roughly but I'll try to explain myself if anyone needs clarification. I'm not trying to bash or insult anyone, I'm just a little confused is all.   Edit: Just wanted to clarify I'm quite happy with myself and don't plan on changing for these people. I was just interested to see if anyone else has run into people like this and their opinions on this other kind of sexism. And no, I'm not upset or hurt over it it anyway. But I appreciate the concern!

So given our poor track record of post-invasion reconstruction (Iraq, Afgan). I think it might be easier and cheaper to use the same amount of money that would cost in an invasion and simply invested in North Korea economy, and flood the market with american goods and culture. IE; kill them with money and freedom, instead of bullet. It would probably be better off for the NK citizen and we don't have to sent our troops over.

If your store has more than 5 people working there it is almost impossible to have any negative ramifications come from that.   For me I work at Trader Joe's in Issaquah, Washington. Anyone else?

And then there's writing all those heavy dynamics and articulations into music... want my two cents on that?
Stop the partisan circle jerk; Eat bacon, 'cause bacon makes everything better. And I like Ike and Kennedy... LBJ gets the save.   Addendum : [Syria vs Iraq]( - for those that would argue that the GOP is the only party capable of this emphasis on sticking with the party line, then why are there Dems who support Obama in Syria yet opposed Bush in Iraq? Can't have the cake and eat it too on this one - neither case is a war we should be in; neither case is a situation where the President is conceding to his opponents. False equivalency? - no, cause this is about the party line, not the gravity of the issue.

Don't be with someone that will tear you down and make you depend on them or talks badly about everyone
wars are countries fighting against one another. USA vs Iraq. It was basically Bush/Obama vs Saddam Hussein. Soldiers are basically just extensions for the people in control. Bush and Obama are Yale/Harvard graduates with law degrees.*   Soldiers? Alpha? How?   Was in the army. Now in law school. I can tell you, it takes much more aggression and dominant arrogance to survive the latter. Survive the army? You just need to fear, to let them instil it into you. The best soldiers that go into war are the best at listening, at following commands. The best servants.   Welcome to 2013, you monkeys brainwashed by government propoganda.*   p.s. prolly will get Down-voted  heavily for this. Anyone who agrees with me should try to help me out and cancel out their stupidity. Stupidity knows no bounds, the stupid are always too stupid to know they're stupid.

Played the shit out of runescape as a kid. Jagex took out wildy and free trade so it started to die down.

If we want two time GSL semifinalists like soO to go to Blizzcon, if we want our WCS champions like Pigbaby to go to Blizzcon, then it should be harder to accumulate a lot of points just by attending 8-9 non-WCS events (which is what most of the players in the top 16 did, and what nobody outside of the top 16 did).

Vocoders, talk boxes, and auto tune are three very different technologies. Vocoders and talk boxes take much more skill to use than auto tune, and it sucks when an artist will use vocoders and talk boxes and be dismissed as "cheating" as if they are using autotune.   On another note, I quite frankly do not care if somebody uses autotune, vocoding, or talk boxing. Good singers could use them too to make their songs better, and these technologies are not at all taking away opportunities from traditional singers, but actually add to them.

I was cheated on in a past relationship and we were never able to get past that, and now I'm worried we're headed in the same direction. An open relationship is not right for me.

Hot summers day. Me and my friend decided that it would be funny to pretend to be drunk infront of my other friends. Was hilarious for a while but one of my friends called my aunt, who then took me home to my mom, who then grounded me for a month. I figured it would be better to keep the lie going and take the punishment rather than look like a cunt infront of my friends.

Borderlands keeps crashing on load screen. Have reinstalled drivers to fix previously, not working now. Me dumb, please help.   Edit: [This]( is what pops up after the crash.   Edit 2: Downloaded igdumd32.dll and placed it in the System32 folder. It ended up corrupting my saved game and erasing my character. Thankfully, by removing it I was able to get Bebop the Siren back!   Edit 3: Attempted using the Toshiba rather than the NVIDIA driver, unfortunately didn't work.   Edit 4: Looks like getting a new video card is the only option. Cutting my losses since the game was only $7.50 and while I could afford that, I can't afford a new graphics card. Sigh. Thanks a bunch anyway everybody!

I met someone 6 months or so ago. On the surface he seems like a classic - just sleeps around guy. He was different in person though. Kinder/more sincere. He was flirty with me, slept with other girls, tried it on with me, asked me on dates, never confirmed them, I pushed him away a bit too (insecurities - im such a walking cliche). Not sure why it didn't go further or how to take it further next time.

LemonNation was right, but there's more to it than that. NA/EU players are very good but these regions don't have the infrastructure to compete with Korea or China. Less money + less coaches and analysts + having to scrim against worse teams (because of a lesser infrastructure supporting the amateur teams that they scrim against) = NA/EU has a  very  slim chance of winning S3 WCS.   But don't give up. Support the cause, seriously. If we can make this thing grow, then NA/EU will have enough financial support to be legitimately competitive worldwide. All we need is a lot of fans who are vocalizing their support, and sponsors will take notice. Maybe we can even get an NA/EU version of KeSPA... that would be a  big  step forward for us.

Deconstruction highlights audience assumptions about a genre by creating a work where most of the expected elements are conspicuously absent or inverted by "playing them straight". It does this to explore how things fall apart once the unquestioned standards are gone. There's a scale from basic self-awareness to out-and-out deconstruction, and nobody agrees on where the line is drawn between them.

We have proof (as of just today) of girlfriends ex-roommate forged signature and cashed a check stealing the money back in October. Lots of text logs of her creating lies and stories of it. Quite possible she also stole a ring worth about $4,000 back in March as well. What can/should we do in terms of at least scaring her so she doesn't get off with 0 consequences? Not too concerned about the money, just more at least getting her on the forgery at minimum.   Thanks

My husband is thinking about leaving our shared religion and I need advice on how to handle this situation in a supportive way, despite the fact that I am concerned for how this will change our marriage (and I desperately want him to remain in our shared faith).   Edit: I didn't originally want to mention our specific faith, because I know reddit likes to rag on us (hey, mormons can be weird... I make fun of us too sometimes), but people have mentioned that knowledge would be helpful. I am a Latter-Day Saint (Mormon). The issues of drinking alcohol and other things are more minor for me. Mostly they would be a reminder that our lives had changed, which would definitely be more of an issue at first.   I have never liked being alone, so I don't like the thought of going to church alone. A tiny part of that is because of the community, but most of it is because I hate being alone, and we recently moved, so I am not close with anyone in our new congregation.   The biggest issue for me is that of eternity (this does have to do with religion after all). Our church believes in eternal marriage. Basically, if we obey God's commandments, and keep promises to God, our marriage will last beyond this life. I know that may be an odd belief, especially for the atheists out there, but for me it is a big deal (I still hold to my religious beliefs). The fact that my husband is thinking about leaving our church, means that our marriage ends when our lives do. Again, I know this is viewed as silly by many, but it is probably the biggest reason why I am hurting right now.

1. Karma is not weak, if her win rate is 35%, it's because people pick her up for five games, fail hard, then quit. 2. Karma does not suck; you do. 3. You cannot mindlessly play Karma, an attribute that will immediately scratch her off the lists of 97% of League's player base. 4. If you're one of my friends, and you ever play with that Karma skin, I will not game with you for a week, cumulative. I honestly don't think you deserve it, after the hell older Karma players had to go through to play a champion they loved.

I, a non-smoker, feel like my boyfriend's pot smoking makes him not the person I love, and it bothers me. Need some perspective on how to deal with this.   Edit:  Thank you to everyone for your perspective. That's why I posted this in the first place. I knew full well I was going to get bashed by some of the pro-weed people who only read into what I said enough to fuel their anger at me. But those opinions are important to read too. I'm trying to read through everything and respond where I can, but I just wanted to make sure that you all know I appreciate your input and it does help. Here's some important points people seem to be missing a lot, though:     I'm not asking him to quit, just to not smoke when he and I are hanging out together. He still has plenty of opportunities to smoke otherwise.     I did not impose 'you can only smoke x amount on x days' rules.     I have smoked before, and it offered me very little. This is why I tried to have conversations with him to understand his motivations for liking to smoke so often. So, unfortunately, getting high with him wouldn't really be a solution.       Again, thank you for taking time to write out your thoughts.
Good idea, but there's a lot of lurking issues that you may not think about at first that need to be considered.

Don't go too cheap that you'll fail.  Production doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg, but what good is it if the distribution method barely exists.   EDIT: Just saw that you're only expecting something around 50 viewers.  As long as you relay the stream through a CDN, then you'll be fine.  Just make sure you have decent audio, and try to have a dedicated data line other than 4g, then you should be good.

When you know you're going to be late because you're honestly stuck in traffic and can't get out of it, call your boss (or whoever you're supposed to be meeting with) as soon as you realize you won't make it on time.  It ensures that they hear the excuse before they're already annoyed with you for making them wait, and as long as you don't do it very often, it shows that you respect their time.

If it were true, we'd be able to have successfully tested it by now. It violates Occam's razor. It's a bad theory.

Battletoads is an okay game.  The art for it was brilliant and it had some of hardest and most thoughtful platforming gameplay of the era.  The story sucked however, and a lot of the "difficulty" was derived from weak design instead of excellent gameplay.

the Sylvari knew that Riannoc was dead by the time Malomedies was experimented on the asura. In their discussions about what would happen to Malomedies, they wondered if he would die like Riannoc did. In the Seeds of Truth the sylvari reference Malomedies being experimented on (so it has happened and they've talked about his death - they know it happened).   I was excited that sylvari lore was being expanded on but not I hope they just stop doing it. They keep messing it up.

We could sign Horford + Durant and still have enough assets to trade for another big star - but any such deal needs to include the salary of Avery Bradley.  I'd be surprised if he's in our pitch to Durant   Edit:  Someone points out that Bradley is at a basketball camp and will not be attending.  This confirms what I suspected.   To clarify, I hope we keep Bradley.  I'm in no way trying to dump on Bradley.  I'm just telling you that it doesn't make sense for Bradley to be part of our recruiting pitch to Durant.  Don't expect Bradley to reach out to KD in any way.  If part of our pitch to Durant involves convincing him that we can swing a trade for another impact player (Middleton, Butler, Cousins, etc), unfortunately Bradley is going to be the guy we will need to ship out due to his salary.  It's just math.

I want to explore my sexuality yet my gf keeps putting me down in   Update: I showed her this thread and she says she wants me to see other girls. She says she loves me and that I should be able to explore but she dose not want to be part of it. If you disagree with what I am saying its fine. I understand. I was just looking for an outside view and wanted to vent. Thanks!   ITT: r/relationships judges people harshly on their sexuality, sorry I should have posted in r/sex

What are the best ways to relax? Do I just push through my resistance and hope not to burn out? Does anyone have good techniques or methods for creating routines or scheduling their time, especially for people who don't like to feel that they are living according to their schedule?
Personally I feel if you really apply yourself, and are transparent with struggles, it's pretty difficult to really "fail" at Software Development. I think it's a good thing to be self-aware about the quality/quantity of your work, but don't let it run you into the ground. You're going to do fine!
I had a very specific problem, if you didn't buy directly from Desura check your email for an email from b0b, otherwise maybe contact him for help.

Tired of everyone (in my circle of influence, not necessarily reddit) thinking I need a relationship to be happy when I'm already really damn happy.
GF wants me to give time into considering children, and I can't present my  side without coming off as, "I don't love you enough to consider this." Help!   update  I talked with her about the situation at hand. She seems to have calmed down, and wanted me to know she respected my choice. She did emphasize that nobody knew 100% what they want in the future. I still said, I do not want kids. She replied with not wanting kids until after school around 5 to 10 years away if she even did. She strongly wants us to be together regardless of kids. This makes me still nervous 10 years from now if this happens again. I don't want to break up with her, but it seems inevitable.   update 2  Thanks for all the advice and perspectives everyone. I do really appreciate it. We are still young, so there is time to think about these kinds of things. I do not want to bank on divorcing later in life either.
Long relationship broken off in a new town. Ok to keep (ex)SO as a friend?
There are features I love and features I hate, and it kind of evens out into a grey area of not knowing exactly how I feel about this patch. At times it almost seems like the ultra-hardcore community are getting catered to more and more. Nothing wrong with that, but a lot of casual players are turned off by the sheer intensity of walking into Cherno or Elektro for the first time and being sniped at by bandits in addition to the horde of 40 zeds following them.

Current SO and I have a pretty good relationship, but he is still talking to his "big ex" and I am worried about her place in his life and whether or not he is investing too much time into her.     Edit : Wow. I just want to thank everybody here sincerely for the wonderful input, advice, and thoughts. I'm reading through every single comment - I'm at work so I can't reply to all of them but I am taking everything to heart and applying your thoughts to the situation.   Keep it coming. Thank you all, so so much.
Fracture interrupts the systematic GCD nature of monks Buffs/Debuffs, making it a net dps loss in most situations   Your post never backs that up. You say that fracture use is "...tricky and usually not worth the time.", but this is a theorycrafting thread. When the goal is mathematically maximizing your DPS, any increase is "worth the time". And if you're at the point where the nuances of theorycrafting comes into play, you have to assume that the player is good enough to do "tricky" things to maximize their DPS.

Its just a little mistake on the english wiki page
Good vs. Evil is an overused archetype that Riot has purposefully avoided making a central theme. If you want the game to be Good vs. Evil faction fights, go play WoW. Choosing factions promotes divisions among players, and that's not what the LoL community and Riot want or need.
Community focused one subtle one liners (much akin to Arrested Development). It developed the pop culture parody aspect of it, and took it too much to that extreme, negating any healthy balance of parody jokes to other jokes. It became too heavy handed with its humor. This is evident through how silly its characters got and how gimmicky episodes became.
I believe everyone should vote. But I also believe those of us who are informed critical thinkers have the duty to encourage people to be the same. Don't tell someone it doesn't matter what they do as long as they participate - teach them how to find the truth.

I had PTSD when I was younger and I thought I was good with it, but it came back.  I've attempted suicide twice before and I don't want to die yet, per se, I'm just so tired of living.  I hate myself and I'll never accomplish anything because whenever I try it's either migraines, PTSD, depression, anxiety, muscle atrophy, fatigue, or some other medical bullshit that pushes me back down.  I want to break this cycle of misery.

You don't go to the gym to build muscle, you go to the gym to LIFT to  break down  muscle so that it can rebuild itself bigger and stronger. That rebuilding occurs DURING SLEEP, so you can't gain without getting good sleep. That rebuilding will never occur unless your body has the energy and nutrients to rebuild, which come from your DIET. DIET IS EXTREMELY, UNBELIEVABLY, RI-FUCKING-DICULOUSLY IMPORTANT. DIET IS THE BIGGEST, HUGEST, MOST IMPORTANT STEP IF YOU WANT TO SEE ANY KIND OF RESULTS. GET YOUR FUCKING DIET IN ORDER.   Easy as that.   PS: Did I tell you to get your diet in order?

Zender could be perfectly fine or terrible, depending on your personality, how well you get along with the neighbors and which building you move into. IMO it would be much easier to find a good block on the north side with a house or duplex for rent, even if it ends up costing more in the long term. You probably won't have to deal with shady management that way.

I'll be betting on Dignitas for this game. After analysis, they just seem to have the stronger lineup currently, even considering VP playing highly as of late. When you factor in Dignitas's CT-side performances, and Overpass being a CT sided map, it's a no-brainer.
Show up consistently, ask questions and for direct feedback from your "big brothers" and coaches on what you are doing that they exploited.  Tournaments/promotions/everything else BJJ related will tend to fall in line as they will give advice on the holes in your game from positions to Strength and conditioning advice etc.  Happy training everyone.

consensus among miners rather than consensus among DAO token holders makes no sense to me. I have even heard people go as far as saying DAOtoken holders don't know enough, and that this is why. I hope others here aren't taking that stance also.

I don't really have a better theory than the Big Bang, and in fact, I don't really think there is one (at least not yet). In all likelihood, those clever scientists have got things figured out right. But there's still a chance - however remote - that we don't know the full story. I enjoy entertaining these doubts sometimes (usually after a bowl) and I think it's probably healthy to do so, even if at the end of the day, the Big Bang is still the best explanation we've got.

Ex-gf was with another guy but break-up with him to be with me again because she wasn't feeling good with him (no common interests with him, plus I'm a better talker apparently) and came back to me.   Reddit, what should I do to not push things too fast?   I'm afraid that if I don't move I might get friend-zoned.. Also is it okay to always wait for her to text me so I'm not insistent?   What can I do when I'm with her to make her feel protected and comfortable with me?   When I give her value I'm afraid of being needy, should I just tell her what I feel about her (like I miss her, I really care about her, etc.), or should I wait till she recovers from her most-recent break-up?   Any help would be appreciated reddit. If I missed something I will try to edit the post, and sorry for my english!

Visited my high school a year post graduation. Walked towards the Athletic Director. Thought he was talking to me even though he probably didn't even know me. He was talking to someone else behind me. He tried to shake this person's hand but I shook his hand instead. Then he felt obligated to talk to me to ease the situation. Very, very awkward and uncomfortable.

In an awesome relationship with the best friend I have ever had, but I'm feeling young and restless and she wants to settle down.   Edit  I know that I have to break up with her. I want advice on how to do that without losing our great friendship. Think Seinfeld and Elaine. That is what I want, I just don't know how to get there or if it's even possible.
my brother and his girlfriend have absolutely no separation and their lives are spent 100% together to the point that he is refusing to ever spend time with me unless his girlfriend is there.

I fucked my life, but I want a gameplan, I want to know I'm working toward getting out of this rut. I know it won't happen overnight, but I don't want to live the rest of my life like this. I don't know where to start.   EDIT: Ran a credit report, 16 "potentially negative" items and 5 accounts in good standing, though most of the potentially negative items don't seem that bad?     2 open private student loans that are 180+ days past due     2 credit cards listed as closed, 1 of which is listed as paid.     3 private loans listed as under collections.     6 of the government loans that were consolidated are listed as paid and closed. This can't possibly be bad though, correct?     For some reason Verizon has me placed in collections....I've never used Verizon in my life. I guess I have a phone call to make.     2 private student loans listed as "charged off"       The 5 accounts in good standing are 3 that were paid in the consolidation and then 2 are the consolidation itself, I don't understand why some are listed under good standing while 6 are listed under potentially negative.

is that medical research is expensive, complicated, and takes a lot of careful analysis to deal with costs over long term - its not about how much you make today, but how much you need to make today so you can support the 5-15 years of research required for your next product. It's easy to get emotional about it, but that doesn't leave room for trying to figure out how we can influence a better system overall for medical R&D and production.     ^edit: In response to the marketing being 2x development: If you come up with a solution, and don't tell anyone about it, is it still a solution? I believe this applies equally if not more so to pharma, because not only do you have to tell people about the solution, you need to make sure they know exactly how to apply it, the risks of applying it, and make sure that your instructions are good enough to limit liability in the event someone does it wrong anyways. Could this happen with just a press release? Maybe, but I think that if you're going to spend 11B on acquiring a company that  might  have a solution (Microsoft spent 9.6B on R&D in 2013 alone), you're going to want to spend a decent amount of coin making sure that  everyone  knows you got it right when you finally have a working product.   this is not to say there isn't shitty marketing happening.  There likely is. But assuming the entire marketing budget is for shitty reasons is hyperbolic at best. I do not believe its so simple to say that, since according to studies (which might not be indicative of the entire field of pharma companies) that there is a pattern of 2x marketing vs development, that its a sign that their final costs are bollocks because they are really covering more of the marketing. Marketing is still important, just as development is.   /u/argh_argh_argh posted [here]( information on the Marketing VS R&D   /u/kerovon posted [here]( a contrast to that.   Read them and come to your own conclusions on this.     ^^^figures ^^^my ^^^first ^^^comment ^^^to ^^^/r/news ^^^gets ^^^all ^^^this ^^^attention ^^^while ^^^i'm ^^^at ^^^work.   /u/VanillaTarantino posted [here]( some good research on how other acquisitions failed, so as to better answer questions/concerns regarding how much that plays a part in things. With each acquisition is additional money spent on that line of research that was essentially lost.   (hopefully) final edit: If people reading this are really upset about the idea of a system that allows for this to happen, then the next time elections come around,  get the fuck out there and vote.  Your legislators matter. If you want to promote a society where there is strong public funding for medical research, then it has to start with the people. Right now our legislators can't even agree how how to deal with healthcare - many states are cutting public education, welfare to the poor or needy, so on and so forth. If that pisses you off, then  fucking vote  and tell your friends/family to vote. A comment on Reddit does next to nothing if its not followed by action.   Gold. Wat. 0.o Thank you much!   ^edit I'm going out and might not be back for a few hours. Hopefully I can answer any questions that I can, and we can continue to debate the topic.

Cheers all!   ^edit I think we broke Reddit 0.o   ^edit one more edit to piss of the sender of my first piece of hatemail. Eat a dick!

Well, it seems that farming straight to radiant relics is more efficient method as you always use less relics and the number of runs required do not differ much between the two methods.  You will need a trustworthy group/large ignore list.  A full team of 4 players should expect to farm a rare item in <20 runs if always desecrating with a nekros and each person consuming 3x radiant relics & 11 junk relics (or 17 so you have more chances at ducats).

Ex girlfriend that I still live with slept with another guy and I'm still in love with her. The situation has caused me to not be in full control of my emotions and I generally feel confused about how to proceed and what to think. How do I fall out of love with her but keep her as a close friend? How do I come to terms with it and what should I feel? How do j use this experience to grow into a better person?   I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and respond. I sincerely hope that you all don't judge me for what I've written above. It's a strange situation and I openly admit that I am not in a stable place emotionally.   Also. Please forgive any typos or weird words. I'm typing on my phone and autocorrect is retarded.   Thank you all again.   Edit: It seems like I'm really trying to accomplish something that many people disagree with. I don't think you guys are wrong. I just came here looking for some answers to my weird situation, but I feel rather attacked. Many of you assume that I'm really fucked up and pathetic. I'm not trying to be argumentative or appear like I'm wallowing in self pity, and truth be told I find that pretty offensive. I know that will make me even less popular around here. The truth is that I know I will recover, because I'm a relatively happy and confident person, but the situation I'm in often times feels pretty confusing. I didn't realize how different our thinking was, which is probably why I was hit so hard when it all went down.   I'm looking for ways to improve myself so that I'm not fooled into this kind of situation again. I have no real desire to rekindle our relationship because I know that's gone for good. Sure, I'm still hurting pretty bad, but I know I can't control people so I'll move on alone.   I thought we could recover a friendship because we both care about each other and it's what we said we both wanted. I realize now that I'm not ready for that yet. I need to get on with my life first, which I have the full intention of doing. I'm probably going to finish out the year at my new job (it's seasonal, but it pays well) in order to save up some money. Then I'm likely going to move back in with my dad while I finish my certification and look into jobs abroad. When I come back, I'll return to school for my masters.   I may have come off as defeatist, but I'm not defeated.

Current German flair is technically inaccurate (wrong flag). If we wanted to show more appropriate symbols, we would be using the circled white star and the Eisernes Kreuz (iron cross). We would also have a flair for the US pilots (blue circle, white star, red center circle). Though the national flags would be somewhat acceptable for both sides.   Edit: Accidentally some words.   Edit: The views above are completely used for the sake of accuracy and fact, not opinion. I really don't care if you want to use the Swastika because "we shouldn't hide from it... blah blah". BUT, for the sake of historical accuracy, there are the facts. Let's not turn this into a political and opinionated game. Let's stick with historical accuracy to maintain a really sweet game.

I saw a "fake" phone number on a poster for an invention project, called it in the front of my friends and some acquaintances, turned out to be a sex line, and I got embarrassed and reminded of the incident many times.

Apple & AT&T screwed each other up, AT&T didn't give a shit, Apple killed it and got my iPhone 7+ on its way sooner than it would have had nothing happened at all.   moral: don't have 2 orders simultaneously if you have it now.  Talk to your carrier and cancel that one out to make sure apple doesn't hit any issues when they go to ship.  And you need at least a day to clear that upgrade eligibility flag in (at least) AT&T's system.

My boyfriend's mom has been living with us for a year now and I feel like it's having a negative affect on my relationship with her son. I'm also scared he has no ambition anymore and that our relationship may be going downhill and fast. I don't want to lose everything we have worked so hard together to have in life but I don't want to be stuck in a relationship that is going nowhere.   EDIT: I know this is jumbled up and I tried to make everything as clear as possible but I just had so much on my mind. If there is anything that would make this more clear or information that would help you better understand my situation, please ask me.
Google results suggest that Apple's brand is entirely separate from it products and there were no mentions of Apple's brand as a product, only a very effective way to build product loyalty and sell the products themselves.
How do I ask out the deaf girl in my (college) chemistry class?   UPDATE: Yesterday, I talked her before class had started. I walked in and she was sitting alone at her table. I walked over, sat across from her, and asked her "what's your name?" We had a small conversation that died once I didn't know what she was signing anymore. At that point, I sat back down at my table and we caught each other's eyes the rest of the class period. Long story short: I introduced myself and got her name. Tomorrow i'm going to talk to her again.
no, I was never abused. I count myself infinitely lucky.
Go bloody read it, I went through all this effort typing the least you can do is read.
I used to be a loyal PSA customer, because of their quality and prices often being among the best bang for your buck. I always heard that they're able to cut costs on products by cutting back on quality control and customer service. I didn't care until it finally happened to me. I advise anyone else who calls PSA customer service to try and request Sharon, but don't call Sharon just to blow up on her. Sharon really did want to help me, and she did everything she could without being as smug as the first woman I spoke with. Excuse my language, but the first PSA CS rep I spoke with seemed like a bitch that doesn't give enough fucks want to try and help customers, she just did everything exactly by the book with a smug attitude. I worked retail long enough to know that if I'm good at my job I can bend the book just enough the satisfy both parties and keep things calm. In then end, I was the only loser. PSA didn't have to replace anything, and the gun shop ordered a new barrel to add to their sales.   Bonus  In the shop the only option for a 16" barrel was a carbine-length gas Green Mountain. The gunsmith was willing to cut me a deal on the GM barrel but I wanted a mid-length. So he offers to order a [CMMG 16" mid]( for $150 and not charge any labor because I'd be ordering the barrel from them. I inquire about lightweight barrels and the pro's and con's. I end up deciding that for my purpose and budget, that a lightweight barrel would suit my needs and probably be more enjoyable. I ended up ordering an [Odin Works 223 Wylde ULTRAlight]( for $236 after tax, and no labor charge for the complete install of a new barrel and the handguard that I brought in.   Edit:  More details, some grammar.   Edit2:  I didn't go wrong with the Odin Works barrel did I? Will I still be able to shoot all the common rounds through a 223 Wylde barrel with 1/8 twist?   Edit3:  Reasons for choosing the barrel I did. I wanted mid-length gas system on a 16" barrel. I've been interested in lightweight barrels for a while. It appears I'm saving 4.6oz compared to my [previous barrel]( I'm not competing for accuracy, my main go to range is only 100 yards. The only time I get to stretch out to 200-600 yards is once a year with a family friend on their private land. I also don't get to do regular mag dumps at the ranges I visit so I don't see overheating being an issue.

Peltasts are great when used right vs heavy armour infantry but slings/bows are more use vs lightly armoured foes (Iberians/Nomads). There is no one perfect army composition to go against all of the varied cultural fighting styles of the Roman Era. Use your noodle and plan accordingly.
my views on politics and such are radically different from everyone else around me, I have nobody who can support me in that sense, I'm pummeled with invalid (and occasionally valid) criticism about said views constantly from my friends with nobody to back me up, my whole family except maybe three people disagree with me and none of them know, and I feel completely alone.   I'm hesitant to post this at all, because I think there are plenty of other people with much more serious problems than me, and I don't want to keep them from getting the help they need.

The things you say are correct, but in the context given, I still think you are misguided in  correcting  me.   If this were a filmmaking research paper, yes I would agree with you.

Michigan law is that as long as the shop gets a copy of Photo ID, holds for 30 days, if it turns out to be stolen, the original owner gets to buy back his stuff at the price the pawn shop paid.   Thankfully, we had Renters insurance and they covered everything after the deductible insofar as getting the stuff out of the shop... but policies can vary on that...

Epilogue:  Some veil was lifted after its words sank in, and I could then feel myself laying on my bed  and  standing there, looking at my own ghost.  I couldn't move.  I wondered if this was hell, or the beginnings of brain death, for several very, very long seconds before my first episode of sleep paralysis released me, as quickly as though a tether was cut.   Afterword , special for you, r/nosleep:  Dismiss this as "just a dream" if you want, and please do remove it if dreams aren't welcome here at all.  But remember that it took billions of years of not-quite-random events to generate things as amazingly complex as the human brain, and the study of dreams is more  embryonic  than "in its infancy."   If you don't think dreams can surprise you, hurt you, or unmake parts of your mind, you're setting yourself up for a fall.  No one is exempt, not even trained hobbyist dreamers, and no one can say with authority exactly how dreams like this one are  really  influenced.   Edit : I've been reading up on r/nosleep culture, and I think I owe some of the explanation Naegino asked for.  The dream was a key to something unusual that I later learned how to use, and to make a long, private story short, it saved my life.  I'm a believer in precognitive dreams.

IMO, If NI was nuked into a massive hole that people put rubbish in, it still wouldn't be a bigger dump than this place currently is.   Continued : This subreddit is a prime example of the problems northern ireland has and yes i'm aware i'm not exactly helping chance the pace but wouldn't want to break away from the flow now would we.   Almost every post on the front page of this subreddit is a poorly disguised dig at one side of the sectarian divide or the other, most of the titles you could replace with either "lol fucking protestants" or "lol fucking catholics" and would have the same effect.

A drive with a faster read and write is not going to mean it will increase your fps. IF it has a really fast latency to fetch data, like an IOPS of 100k, then yes you will see some improvement, but that improvement is only because your old drive just sucked shit, and your system is no longer being bottle necked by it. AND THAT is only if you are playing a game where constant data retrieval is really important like it is in Fallout 3 and others that require constant data. Games like these do really really well with lots of super fast ram. Even if you have a really slow hard drive, the high capacity ram with really low latency and high speeds is all you really need. Your hard drive will just make you wait longer through the load times is all.   Or to simplify it. Your hard drive isn't increasing your fps. Your system is getting a better fps because it isn't being held back from the data it requires due to a shitty hard drive/ram combo. Does the hard drive affect fps. Not really. Sometimes yes, but more often than not, no. More often than not, the ram is the real culprit for low fps.
I don't have that fuzzy, giddy, excited, nervous, and anxious feeling about my SO anymore - at least not as much as I used to. I want that feeling back but I cannot figure out what made it go away.

All the list does is show the rankings of films based on a simple numerical average score compiled of all user's ratings. Like ANY other numerical figure scoring system, it does exactly what it's designed to do, and if you have an issue with that system as a whole then you're in the wrong place because this whole discussion is purely about the value of those numbers.

Got added on Pinterest by an ex. What does it mean, if anything? Just read the damn post, it's not that long.   UPDATE:   So here's what happened: I texted her. The transcript follows.   Me: Hey 9:08 PM   Her: Nate? 9:08 PM   Me: Ha. No you added me on pinterest so I thought I'd say "hi" on the off chance it wasn't an auto add from importing your Gmail contacts or something. 9:10 PM   Her: Who is this? 9:14 PM   Me: /u/duodan. And if I misjudged (or misremembered this number), then no harm, no foul. Have a good night! 9:15 PM   That was it. Like I said, no harm, no foul. I am not/was not hung up on this girl, just genuinely curious. Thanks for the input, all.

Getting a girl to laugh will break down her barriers, she'll no longer see you as a creep hitting on her, but as a cool funny guy.       I'm not Brad Pitt. Any other time, these rich white girls would NEVER give me a second glance because:     I'm not white   blond   blue eyed    or a "hunk"     so I don't fit into the mold their typical boyfriends all fit into. But after making them laugh I had 3 of them charmed, giddy, and reluctant to leave.   Time to do some serious studying on how to be funny :)   Like I said earlier, I'm a forever lone loser with zero friends so this is the only place I can talk to anyone about this.

Joffry Lannister will be my boss for the next couple of weeks, how do I protect myself and my coworkers from the idiot?   My ideas are:   A) work normally, let her do her thing, and then tell the boss everything   B) work really hard and do my best, be step ahead of her and don't give her the satisfaction to bitch around   C) make use of the few days I got to make become best friends with her, so she leaves me alone - this is basically impossible because 1) I don't have the stomach, 2) I don't know how to play the game and 3) it will be super obvoius because I barelly talk to her these days   D) this is the only that makes sense to me: mention to the boss Sandy is very happy to be in charge and that she can barelly wait for her (boss) to leave - which is true, the boss most probably wont like and she'll make something to bring the bird down a bit   Help me, please!

Unfortunately, this is often true. However, with teamwork, I think the guided shells are the best option. Of course, as can be seen below, everyone has their own preferences!

ECM feedback is sometimes useful, but not when there's a million specials.
you absolutely want to make one llc for all properties instead of one for each because it will make things a thousand times less of a pain in the ass and it's all one bank account that way but separate sub-accounts in your llc accountant's book keeping.
I'm a moron.

Our relationship is amazing mentally and emotionally but I don't get any enjoyment out of anything sexual with him, it's just awkward and it seems to be getting worse. Sexually frustrated.
I don't really care as long as what they make is the same quality as what we're used to.
Lag on the water any better since launch?
They were right to do a full refund, as it was the quickest way to resolve the dispute without either side losing out.
nope, not even close.   The real issue is that you can crash servers with yields as small as a few thousand in some circumstances.
More than half of the posts every day here are just complaints about the same issues. It'd be nice for just a day even to see this subreddit back to talking about how much fun this damn game is.

Playlist is happy classic rock and motown songs, mostly about love and happiness. Thoughts? Be critical.   THANKS!   Edit: Groom requested a song by Led Zeppelin. I threw in All My Love but I'm tempted to swap it for Thank You.
My mistakes have made me who I am and I'd rather be here than do it over and be someone who did everything right.
How do you deal with your fear of aging?     Met criteria: score>1 and comments>7
I'd usually take it as a sign to give up, but a lot of people told me he's a really, really quiet person by nature. So I don't know what to do! Any thoughts, Reddit? Should I keep trying or is it not gonna happen?
I was a rookie drinker, puked a shit load, a little girl slips right in my vomit.
my in laws driving me to work fires up my anxiety, managers at work dont like me, and i find babysitting to pay a lot MORE. should i quit my job now or should i TRY to find a job before quitting? I am going out of my mind and depressed. i have gained like 15 lbs with this new job, simply from the stress and anxiety.
dont worry about it. dont do it again.
hairdryer fell off the counter and switched itself on. freaked me out.
Not a rant. Campaign was great. Multiplayer is essentially broken with lag, glitching, and gun balance. Scorestreaks and the maps are mostly underwhelming. Could have had a beta open to fix most, if not all of these issues. The reason I'm making this is if someone is considering buying the game (for the multiplayer experience) they can see this and maybe reconsider or look further into the game before spending 60 bucks on it. I would not recommend at it's current state.   Edit: Formatting
You're retarded.
Not all handicap spots have clear indication that it is handicap.   I learned from the judge that paint is not a requirement for indication of handicap parking. Only a simple sign, even when it is ~10 feet tall and hidden due to foliage.
4 maps at 15 dollars are a steal if you play them enough. Selling anything that has value is fine. If it doesn't have value it's not like you're losing something.
Should I get a Gretsch G9450, Recording King RKOS-06-DBL, or Epiphone MB-100 for my first banjo? Can I just choose a banjo that sounds "ready to go" and avoid paying for a professional setup? Do local shops in your area ever offer a free setup w/purchase, or do any sort of price matching with chain stores?

The people at the Planned Parenthood my friend went to stalled her tests so she wouldn't abort even though she only considered it for health purposes. She ended up nearly dying and needing an emergency surgical abortion.   It is for THIS reason I'm pro-choice. Not "oh I'm not ready it costs too much and my parents will hate me". It's for people that might DIE if they try to have the baby. I'm glad that there are still good PP sites out there, but also terrified that should an accidental pregnancy ever happen to me I'll end up in the hospital as well since I shouldn't physically have children either.
my main question: will quitting porn and masturbation help reduce my social anxiety, inability to make friends, depression, or make it easier to talk to women? Will it give me more motivation to get in shape or lose weight? And could it help with PE?   If quitting PMO can help with one or more of my problems, then I am on board.

The long story short is a lot has to go right for the C's to even be in this series.

Me and my friends go to pick up, dealer doesn't show up. Cops pull us over trying to bust some kids for weed, we get off completely free. And no ticket.
If the front O2 sensor is turning CEL on, you should replace it, but it's not critical. If the rear O2 sensor is turning CEL on, I would personally ignore it unless you can get an O2 sensor for very cheap. They are about $60/sensor for that car at a local auto parts store, and are very simple/easy to install if you are able to climb under a car.
your dough should be fine to use.
Breakups suck. They suck so bad many people will attempt to bargain as a way to hang on.
the concerns are scientifically sound and are taken seriously by experts and regulators in many developed countries.   Genes are not lego.  It's not a matter of "adding a bit of vitamin" into a soup. The currently used gene insertion processes are in no way advanced enough to achieve one and only one specific effect. The long-term effects on human and animal health, biodiversity, the crop plant itself, bacteria, insects (particularly bees and worms) and small animals (e.g. rodents, birds) and plenty of other things have, so far, rarely been assessed appropriately. What is needed are stricter regulatory processes and more transparency to expose fraud by the GMO producing companies.   GMO crops  could  be safe, but they have not been demonstrated to be so - and until that has been done in a transparent and scientifically sound manner there will be critics.   So, well, I support Ben & Jerrie's decision. It's not stupid, hippie-esque or catering to a specific audience. The arguments against GMOs are scientifically sound - GMOS  can  be the food of the future, but currently they are not, although  a lot  of industry lobbyists are pushing the message that GMO are "safe and healthy." They are not and until the long-term effects have been examined we all should at least be  aware  that there could be such effects.

It's possible to gain a pound of fat, but unlikely. You will most likely gain less. How much less is really impossible to tell as it is dependent on a shit-ton of known factors and probably some unknown ones as well.
Opening at lvl 80 is the gambler's route, you can potentially get thirty precursors from thirty bag, or you may only see one 70s exotic.  Opening at lvl 53 will guarantee you a precursor after opening enough.
Thought I had chemistry with a girl. Either it never existed, or I messed it up somehow. What did I do wrong? Would it  be too awkward to ask her if she ever had romantic feelings for me. I just want closure, not a guilt trip.
I'm in over my head.  How can I terminate the romantic without harming the platonic?
Sleep and appetite are being affected by vyvanse, possibly more so because of interaction with wellbutrin. Need advice on eating and sleeping regularly.
microsoft is a nosy bastard.
That is probably indicative of the same level of effort you have used to formulate your opinion... weakly researched at best, defensive to the point of ignorance, and self-admittedly afraid to accept data that is uncomfortable.
Me and him were best of friends for 2 years. We love each other deeply. We met a new girl. She acted real sweet but was actually trying to sabotage our friendship in order to marry him. Now my friend thinks I've betrayed him because I don't like her anymore and he doesn't understand why. 2 years of friendship and trust have been thrown in the trash by a mean girl we met one day...

was in relationship with girl. never got over her. felt she still had feelings for me. not sure if she still does.   EDIT 1: I should add that we met this friend over the summer. I know nothing was taking place between them, but once school started I noticed that they talked to each other very frequently; it seems like they talk every day.

I asked a girl out, she rejected me hardcore, now I just fucked up a long term friendship.   EDIT: I fucking love reddit. You guys are the best for support. Thanks to every one who has commented.   EDIT 2: Fixed text. Talked to her. She said she over reacted, and that she may even give me a chance.
Boyfriend told me he was thinking of having a one night stand during our relationship and i have absolutely no clue what to think or say at all.   EDIT: Thank you very much everyone for the very wide-ranging advice. I have also already thought about breaking up with him directly, but I would much rather try some of the helpful tips to help him "experience" it without it being with someone else. I am very thankful for all of your replies and feel much better. :)
own a business with my father, commuting a long way every day to work there, have to give up the commute, don't want to abandon my business to work some shitty dead-end minimum wage job.

I don't think it's an accident or mistake on their part, just a less than transparent policy that should be changed.
We talked about me being a bit clingy and I asked for some time. Also told him to get back to me when he felt like it. He hasn't, in over a week. What do I do?
Don't sell to minors and always ID check, otherwise people like me can come in, ruin your business, and potentially throw you in jail.
Keep fun at Allstars where it is laid back. Worlds is for the BEST of the Regions to COMPETE. You'd never see Faker playing mid Garen or Poppy in a finals game because its not aimed at fun no matter how much you or Riot or anyone else want the event to be.
My girlfriend is less experienced than me, is scared that she is not able to please me. How can I help her be more confident?   PS: When I finger her, she will softly moan at the beginning, and as I'm rubbing her clit, after a few minutes, the moaning and breathing gets harder and faster. Then comes a point where she'll moan really loudly and grab me and bite me and go into light spasms. From then on, everytime I touch her clit she'll get reaaally into it and almost scream, and this goes on for as long as I keep going. Is this an orgasm? Or is she not there yet? I don't really know, I thought it would be kinda more difficult for women to achieve orgasms, seeing as this happens everytime I finger/go down on her after a few minutes.   Any and all advice would be gladly welcomed!
you'd probably be able to find much better examples of truly dishonorable behavior in fights.
1) UHC is like a 'sport', and sometimes there is crowd trouble. It's kind of unavoidable.   2) Etho's fanbase, I believe, has higher number & proportion of fans who are interested in UHC, but not Mindcrack. Therefore more susceptible to abuse/comments seen in sport between rival clubs

Was in a Cult/Christian church. Escaped. Went crazy and realized the parallels between psychosis and religious thought processes. Smoked pot years later and had an epiphany that sealed the deal associated with lingering brainwashing from earlier in life.

I'm pretty sure Doomguard doesn't make Bane of Doom unbalanced whether or not all nonlegendary demons, all collectible demons, or all demons period are included in the list. Because of RNG. Bane of Doom would still be a not great card, it'd just go from bad to situational, probably in a Demonlock type thing.

went to sleep in love, woke up to her wanting a break, I said no you don't get to put a relationship on pause, she agreed to some space.   Questions: What should I look out for? What do you think is going on if you've been in the same shoes as either one of us?   Update: Trying to smooth this out so people stop misunderstanding the situation apparently wrote this too fast and conclusions are being made that are fault of my poor choice of words and current mind state. I get it I'm immature apparently for asking her walk down the same road we both live on which if you didnt know it was a short walk it would come off rude, I didn't want to be in an awkward silence to bring her home, she walked over here last night after work, not even sure why she asked for a ride back. And I'm immature for refusing to allow a break but no ones seeing that I view a break and space as two different things and I agreed with the space and am giving her that.

PC won't boot, Google offers no assistance. Muchas gracias for any assistance :)   EDIT 1: It just did it again while I was running a file check thing in command line, however before it happened it popped into the Basic colour scheme (sounds like a graphics error to me?), and during the whole cycle of not booting the mobo splash screen was up for a second - If i was quick I could get into the UEFI BIOS but as soon as I exited the same shit happened again.   EDIT 2: CPU temp: 35 celsius, GPU 27 celsius, mobo 20 Celsius

Not all rager's are at fault for being pissy.   EDIT: This game just happened.   We had a malphite. Didn't speak a word of english. He would never initiate. Ever. We would ping, we would ask him to initiate, we would do everything in our power to get this player to use his ulti, and yet he decideds "solo farm" malphite is the best way to go. Lost us the game because we were 4v5 half the time. You would not be mad at this situation?
You're buying into a fictitious narrative,  the budget request only increased from 3.9 trillion to 4 trillion and Bush flushed the money down the toliet instead of investing in infrastructure.
Please avoid reading it and read the wall): Perfect relationship (friends before for 10+ years) which lasts 7 months, A short-term long distance relationship happens (3months). 3 months of LDR makes her to lose the 'feeling' towards me but nothing changes the way she acts. Sex, cuddling, hugging etc continues but inside is empty. She says she wants to be alone for abit. How do I bring the feelings back.   EDIT: We're going to meet and be together for a few days in a couple of days. It might be the last time we do this. I will be asking her questions in order to figure out what is happening with her. If any of you have any questions that you think I should ask please do write them

Mt. Augusta is a minarchist state, and was designed as such.  In my absence it has expanded it's powers to deal with threats which is understandable.  Claiming monies without a treasury, and expanding borders through colonization efforts drastically changes the nature of the state as written.  Whereas these changes are happening outside the voting procedures, and without constitutional approval, they are illegal actions on behalf of the state.   Update: After talking with GTAIVisbest, I have decided to drop this case in the interests of expediency.  He has agreed to write a bill detailing the creation of a bounty coffer.  I would remind political appointees that their words and actions DO bear a weight greater than their person.  To avoid conflicts of interest, it is best to make clear your intentions when you are acting within the role of that position, so as to avoid any undue criticism.  Free people are free to act on their wishes and endeavors, but when you hold a position, you must be aware that you not only speak for yourself, but also for the state.

If you already have a PC, it'll be easier, but if you really want to switch, most important programs are available, use Bootcamp for Windows exclusives, use VMWare to not have to reboot to use Windows   EDIT: If you're going to be virtualizing, get at least 8GB of RAM (buy a lower Mac and get compatible memory after, it'll be cheaper)

I've just never attempted a build of this scale before, and am unsure how best to proceed.

I casually mentioned I'm meeting a girl for a French lesson to the girl I got back together with only two days ago. Got into an argument and today she texted me that she wants to talk tomorrow. I'm terrified she'll tell me it's not a good idea to try again after all. I really want things to work with her.

I went to a party, an older kid came, made us all strip down and then punched a girl in the face. The party-thrower's mum came home and threatened the kid with a baseball bat.   I don't want advice about mine, this was long enough ago that it doesn't matter anymore. "Jesse" went to jail for a completely unrelated incident which I'm actually quite happy about. Now tell me your fucked up house-party stories.
If you feel like unless your have the best of the best in terms of gear/gems, top of the ladder, and are constantly running the hardest content in the game, you will find yourself grinding for thousands of hours. Or you can not make that the goal and just have fun and enjoy the occasional upgrade. Try new builds, try out racing, and try out crazy combos on maps are my recommendations on how to enjoy POE.

I only have 2 spawned bows with fatal XL (plus the farmable alice/lux bows) while I have spawned 7 physical testament lances and a number of decent staves.  &nbsp;  Should I change to lancer? Mage?

I believe religion exists because societies/cultures and individuals require 3 things in order to peacefully grow and advance: an infallible all knowing and powerful governing body, answers to questions about our environment and existence, and most people seem to have a deep desire or "need" for the existence of something better than ourselves which is filled by God or gods.

you attempted to use a dictionary to define "indoctrination" as abuse, but you made the mistake of assuming that your definition of indoctrination -- and the definition agreed upon by society -- are the same, which they are not. thus your argument becomes a circular logic fallacy, to wit: "why is indoctrination abuse? because it is abusive."

thanks for the interesting link but so what if it's not an original idea.
the CX series is often advised against on this sub, and rarely with any reasoning aside from "someone said it was bad" - even if it's only for a low tier build (low wattage, lower tier components)     I have heard of only one recent case, firsthand, where there was an issue with the CX series       IMO, a high tier build deserves a better PSU than the CX series     any user reviews aside, the CX series is simply not designed for high tier enthusiast systems. That's from Corsair directly       IMO, the CX series is fine from what information I have gathered     I don't know why there is such an avoidance and fear of the series           and to specifically address   >Why are you saying there's controversy, flak, crud, etc. when you say you haven't seen any actual reported issues?   The two are not mutually exclusive. I figure it's because those ill-informed users that I mentioned are simply parroting information that they heard from someone else who parroted it.

ives require a pair of nacelles which do some scifi magics to let you go FTL, and that the nacelles have to be some distance from the main ship body (maybe as a safety concern in case they explode), then you'll end up with Star Trek Federation ships.   Or, Star Trek ships were just designed to be cool looking and the warp drive physics were created  later .  That would be arguably better - per what /u/Hay_Lobo is looking for - as at least there's creativity there in the ship design.  The Star Trek ship Enterprise certainly looks creative enough. However, that way of looking at it doesn't fit my proposal.

it is great precisely because it is stupid and took no skill   edit: let me put it another way.  the fact that a developer took the time to code an internet meme achievement for just playing the game in the lego lord of the rings (two huge licenses) is an achievement for gamers and the internet alike.

my questions are:     What can I do to not end up like my mom who can't manage a house with 70,000$ income and has bankruptcy history?     Is wanting to take a vacation when you're making near minimum wage a sad dream? My school is paid for through pell grants and I have no other real expenses.     Can I turn my money into more money?     How do investments even work?     How much of each check should I put away and not be touching?     I also don't want to be like my grandpa, who saved all his life to provide for his grandchildren only to have my snake of a mom spend my brother and I's college money on home renovations and new cars. I know being worried about saving until death is a bit irrational at 18, but it's a concern regardless of its rationality.       Thanks for any help!

Top 10 team on UMG disputes every loss with photoshopped XBL messages and is winning every dispute when the other team isn't submitting capture card quality video proof. Screenshots are not enough and I wanted to bring this to people's attention. Even though they submitted fake proof and lost 2 of the disputes, they remain unbanned. Whats worse is that in UMG's rulebook, they specifically say screenshots of chats are not highly valued evidence. Apparently, they are.   I also want to let you know that we compiled an Imgur album of all of their fake proof with links to their twitter and other evidence and plan contact UMG admins as well. If anyone here from UMG is reading this and want to return credibility to your site, please PM me. These people deserve bans Elite Prime membership or not.

is don't worry about it too much.  If it makes sense to buy something from Dan's because of price or availability or something, its not the end of the world, but the fact that you're asking thus question means your head is in the right place.   Finally, I think it's more important to buy parts made by rider owned companies.  I think the Haros and Felts pose more of a threat to S&M & FBMs than Dan's does to Albes or Empire.
I think the showrunners at HBO will begin to mix ASOS, AFFC, ADWD, TWOW and ADOS all into one continuous story without really separating books into seasons, and also add way more show-original scenes to amp up the action and pace and keep all audience members more engaged.

Edit: Thank you everyone for all of your kind words. I really appreciate everything. I am going to go and spend time with a friend this evening, so I will not be responding for the rest of the night. I will be back tomorrow. Again, I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented. I still feel horrible, however not as horrible as I was initially.

he's the bridge, but if forced to pick either Classical or Romantic to group him under, I think Romantic is a better fit.   Edit: really, I think the only Beethoven that I would put in a must listen which  isn't  from the 19th century, would be his Pathétique Sonata, and even that has some pretty heavily Romantic styles to it, especially in the first movement.

If robots make everything, everything becomes very cheap because we don't have to pay for wages. New jobs will emerge and old ones will change. Some things simply can't be automated, for practical or social reasons. We have been afraid of technology displacing us for many many years and not once have these fears proven realistic. Temporary job loss to technological innovation is an essential step in growing the economy and improving the income and quality of life for everyone.

is that  yes, you did make MSG , or rather,  the MSG was already there, you just made the experience of it more intense .   It should be noted that the consensus on monosodium glutamate as a food additive is that it's harmless: "The general use of glutamate salts (monosodium-l-glutamate and others) as food additive can, thus, be regarded as harmless for the whole population. " [European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007) doi:10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602526]( This is a widely held understanding and you can read an overview of experiments to test whether there actually exists any symptoms induced by MSG [on Wikipedia](

Healthcare is not a basic human right in my world view, but universal health care offers overall advantages to society which cannot be ignored, meaning I support it.  Regardless, personal responsibility is non-negotiable, and parents are responsible for their children.  Whether it's testable or not, whether it's a positive test and you desperately want kids, you know that things can happen going into it, so it's irresponsible and bad decision making to have children without being prepared, monetarily and otherwise.   I don't feel sorry for the baby's parents, at all, regardless of how stupid our healthcare system is.

Dear Blizzard, stop gathering personal information from your customers under the concern of security, which doesn't work anyway. All I need for playing SC2 is an email, a password and the game itself. With a legal copy of the game i am allowed to play the game on any device i like and i'm also allowed to lend the game to a friend. Blizzard is just trying to stop me from sharing the game with friends and collecting personal information about me for market analysis.

Comcast installed my neighbor's internet yesterday. In the process it seems my cable was deliberately cut and disconnected. Called CS 3 times and spoke to 4 different people, tweeted and sent feedback to the SVP of CS, and directly contacted the escalations department and continue to hear radio silence unless I initiate the contact. The best I can expect at this point is a repair technician on Sunday 2/21/16 unless the Escalations Department actually follows through. They are 3 minutes past their self-imposed deadline as I hit "submit".   Edit: Edited to better reflect timeline.   Update 1: PICTURES!!!   Update 2: 8:26PM, 2 hours and 6 minutes after I ended the phone call with the Escalations Department. Still no phone call. Going to reach out again.   Update 3: Also going to send the link to this post to We_Can_Help@Comcast.com   Update 4: E-mail address (We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com) is no longer active. Called Escalations - All I can tell you is that this ticket is "late" and "unresolved".   Update 5: Since my last phone call to the Escalations department (2/17/16 @ 9:06-9:14PM) I finally heard back from the office of Tom Karinshak basically just stating: "I will be escalating your request to attempt an earlier appointment due to our error." @Comcastcares on Twitter responded to my sister (she reposted my original tweet... and has more followers) stating that they had reached out to the local team to get someone out ASAP. I posted to the forum mentioned in the comments below. A technician is scheduled to arrive within the next 3 hours (a service appointment I had made before I had realized that a screw up had occurred). I'll post an update afterwards. Thank you all for your comments and support!

Summary: SMITE seems like it really isn't ready to be released in a few weeks with all the server garbage and interface, and other types, of bugs still rampant.   UPDATE: Seeing that the Reddit has actually put a disclaimer up above about the recent influx of server problems and other bugs is a really big relief that the community is being heard. I hope that actual progress is put into fixing the problems but the acknowledgement is a good reward already. Hope all those like myself see a good patch in the works coming soon!

Boyfriend's crazy ex wife blames me for her divorce and has posted scary shit about guns and weapons on facebook and has started parking outside boyfriend's place when I'm there.

If not, how can I get him to understand she scares me and what can we do against her? Is this worth breaking up over?

Feminism is a broad term that has many definitions, some reasonable and some unreasonable. One particular definition is commonly used on TRP and elsewhere, but it's important to be aware that this is not the only meaning of the term. In a political dialogue, precision of language is of the utmost importance; it defends our cause against accusations of bigotry and ignorance, and ultimately helps us win the war of ideas.

Long distance messaging a guy, was good, and then radio silence.   Edit: I typed this out and realized how much importance I'm giving it in the larger scheme of things. If I feel like messaging him after the game on Sunday maybe I will. If not, another one bites the dust. Also, realized I'm young and hot so I'm going out in Philly tonight -- Ladder 15.
boyfriend had a crazy ex gf and their still friends. I don't feel comfortable about her being a part of the picture. And he knows this somewhat. Any advice for me? Is it wrong to ask him to cut contact with her?

My boyfriend and i are in the stage of our relationship where arguments are beginning to become more frequent. How do we restore our communication and ensure that our fights/arguments revert back to disagreements/discussions?
A plat-gold player thinks that the game is being dumbed down for the general population, and thus brings more and more people to the game. The recent complaints are going to go mostly unresolved unless people realize this and should begin to try and find amicable solutions to these problems other than a complete reversal or rework of those problems. This post would have been more valuable in another thread, but for fear of it getting buried this has been made.   In good faith I will start a discussion on how to make Dynamic Queue workable for the Solo Player.       Most needed is the matchmaking system at high elo, but I have no idea how to solve that.      However, I believe adding a voice-comm system in client will largely dispel most peoples problems with Dynamic Queue as a solo player, as I've said in past posts, some gracefully, some not so much. People will be able to talk to their teammates and actively have a role in their game (feel like they have a role in their game) which I think is absent when a solo player gets matched with a group. I also think it will increase the overall knowledge and skill level of all players. Typing and pinging are not effective ways to communicate strategy, but being able to talk you can get your point across much more quickly and easily thus making people learn/think about more.

in joke form:   A young girl asks her coalminer father, "Why is it so cold in the house?"   "We don't have any coal", he says.   "But why is there no coal?", she wants to know.   "Because I lost my job", he replies.   Still unsatisfied, she asks one more time—"And why did you lose your job?"   To which he answers, "Because there is too much coal".

lungs have specific ICU associated diseases that require complex management protocols and in some cases might involve sacrifcing the function of other organs to recruit them.   As far which is more needed, it is more of a question of what can be done.  Almost anyone can donate their body to science, as in to a med school for disection.  It is the rare person that can actually be an organ donor.  So in this case I'd say if you can be an organ donor do that vs. donating the body to science.  18 people die every day in the US waiting for life saving organs.

there's a trade-off between UC housing and private.   South of 60th isn't dangerous (there's an undergrad dorm south of 60th), but stay north of 64th (maybe 63rd).

So this leaves:   Lupul/Bozak/Kessel   Kulemin/Grabovski/MacArthur   Crabb/Arnott/Hamilton   Brown/Steckel/Prust   Pretty similar to "thatsong", but this is a very good shape-up. A very gritty, defensive team with a first line of solid, proven offense.   Defense goes:   Kuba/Phaneuf   Liles/Schenn   Franson/Gardiner   A very aggressive defensive core, with 2 VERY hard hitting guys and a good amount of two way players.   Goalies:   Schneider/Reimer   Not much to add here, Schneider is a starting quality goaltender, and Reimer could be a pretty solid backup for him.   I'm not going to calculate the math of the cap hit (simply because I will get it incorrect, guaranteed). But with Connolly/Lombardi/Armstrong gone, and Komisarek bought out (2,166,667 next year).. it will generate 13,683,333 in cap space+ what the Leafs have. Give or take, it's 15 million dollars.   Schneider=4, Kuba=3.7, Prust=0.8, Arnott=2.8 In total that equals 11.3 million dollars, leaving an extra 2 million dollars for whoever demands bonuses.

had problems the past week with girlfriend, first problem we fixed the next day and the hung out and healed. next day i was depressing again and annoying when she needed space from being disappointed by her mother saying no to going to the beach with me. Later made worse by me not waking up til 8pm and not talking to her as much as she would have liked and then missing two skype calls. After i blew up her phone because i felt something was wrong and not giving her space, at 12am today i continued being depressing and she was tired and said stuff about us sucking and maybe we should turn us off. That was said at 5:40am and 2 minutes after she fell asleep on skype with me.   &nbsp;   My question is did she say what she said tonight because she was just really tired and upset with me? How should i go about my problems of being to clingy now and make her feel better and reassuring that im willing to fix my problems?

If your digital copy of DriveClub still has a "Buy" button listed under the app menu or in your Library, you're going to need Sony to issue you a refund so you can download the right copy. Otherwise you're going to be SOL if you delete the app and attempt to re-download it in the future.   EDIT: Looks like I didn't get any pre-order bonus cars after all. As I was waiting for my refund to go through with Sony, I was unaware that an update rolled out, offering the Mercedes-Benz GT AMG C190 free to everyone. Sorry for the confusion. In any case I'd still recommend getting a refund and downloading the right version of the game to save yourself from a major headache later on.

I think I’ll return the Sony and stick with the Tab S. Price is the main deciding factor. I also think the Tab S is more visually appealing which is important to me. Rooting & customizing the Tab S should fix a lot of what I dislike about it and I like the active community here. I wish I could justify the price of the Z3 but the incremental performance and battery life just aren’t compelling enough. My typical use-case is playing games/browsing on the couch or hotel room. The Tab S is capable enough to play the games I want (Hearthstone, Clash of Clans) and the battery life is enough to last an evening at home or a domestic flight.  I've realized that battery longevity on a tablet is way less important to me than on a phone.   This has also been x-posted to XDA: [link](

get under cover.   > In case you hear an alarm, you need to get to shelter. Depending on your location in the country this could be as little as 10 seconds or as great as 2 minutes. Please research this if you are traveling in the south.   > *  If there are Israelis around:   > Follow them where they go or ask them for help, many Israelis speak English and will help you if you need it.   > *  If you are in a home that has a safe room (Mamad):   > Go into the room and close the heavy window shutters and the door. This is the most comfortable option lol.   > *  If you are in an older apartment complex with a shared bunker:   > If your hosts are unavailable, exit your apartment and generally there will be others heading in the downward direction. Follow them. If you cannot make it to the bunker, sit in the stairwell. It's the most reinforced part of the building, generally.   > *  If you are outdoors in a populated area with buildings:   > Go inside a store, stand under a covering, get under something. If the Israelis continue walking around, you can probably do the same. I would advise at least standing under something to protect from shrapnel. Stay under cover a couple of minutes after the siren if you hear any loud bangs above you. This means Iron Dome has intercepted a rocket and there will be shrapnel and debris falling.   > *  If you're in an unpopulated area with no shelter (hiking, etc):   > Lay on your stomach on the ground with your hands on your head like you're about to be arrested, feet slightly spread. Lay on top of your children if you like and shield them with your body. You can also squeeze yourself into a tight ball with your hands on your head.     Is Jerusalem okay to visit?     Definitely. There are tons of police and soldiers there, more than usual, so you should feel extra secure on your visit. If possible, travel in groups if you want to add a greater sense of security.     Should I reschedule my Taglit/Birthright trip     That's really up to you. Birthright has never canceled a trip not even in war time. I personally think you'll have a much more memorable experience coming in times of struggle. Some people don't want to risk having their itineraries altered though so you really must make the best decision for yourself. Winter is the best time to explore Israel, anyway. So if you have a trip in the next few weeks I would personally come were I in your shoes.     I'm brown/look Arab, will I have any problems     No. Not now or ever. Most of Israel is brown. 20% of Israel is Arab (not including Arab Jews) You will not face any discrimination.   I've probably not covered everything but these are just basics. Feel free to post any extra comments below! Just keep them in this thread.   Thank you for coming to our sub, we hope you have a wonderful trip!!!

I never chose to like girls, it's just who I'm attracted to, just like gay people are attracted to guys. They're not asking you to deny your sexual preference, so why are you denying them theirs? All for a religion that has zero scientific evidence supporting it. The best religious people can do is say "science can't prove this, so god must have done it" at this point.

High School SHearts GF and BF only enjoy life when with each other. We don't (generally) go out with friends, drink, club, etc if not together. We both like this and both proposed it. We constantly talk on Whatsapp. Constantly. And we have fun and enjoy it. We lost our life outside of each other. No friends if they aren't family.   Is this healthy? Should we pursue a life outside our relationship despite we don't like it?

try not to be so hard on people who are in abusive relationships, there's a lot going on that you probably don't know about, and they're probably really unhappy and will eventually seek a way out. All the excuses they make are just that: excuses to cover for the shame and hurt they're feeling for letting themselves get sucked into that situation.

So to conclude, "If I were to take a DNA swab of a transgender woman, what sex would the DNA results tell me she was? " It wouldn't. It tells you absolutely nothing. Phenotype is what is used in the determination of sex in human beings, and that includes everything from genitalia to endocrine system -- and even neurology. We're all real.   Here is more information for those that like to learn:   Genitalia is not the single factor used to determine sex either:   Total number of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female one in 100 births   There are all sorts of variations in humanity. We're all real.

Just found out my boyfriend isn't and won't get vaccinated. Wondering what other potentially game-changing topics need to be addressed before we get married.   > EDIT  (5 hours later) Just to clarify - my boyfriend does NOT have a firmly held belief that vaccines cause autism. We didn't even get to that point in our conversation before it devolved into an argument, and we both tabled the talk until tomorrow. When I asked him to get vaccinated he said ok. It wasn't until the next day after he talked to his friend that he said he didn't want to. I didn't ask what he believes, I didn't show him any medical evidence. I snapped and got emotional about my sister dying and telling him he was killing our future kids (not a good way to have a discussion) so we paused the talk. Tomorrow when we talk  calmly  I will ask him what he believes about vaccines, and if he really intends to stay unvaccinated.

I'm a friend of the girl who survived 'miraculously' at the Aurora Dark Knight Rises shooting. She is a theist, but not the kind to attribute her survival and recovery to God ahead of medical knowledge and science, so your criticism would be better directed elsewhere.

I'm fair certain she's not a redditor herself, but I think we could all appreciate letting her tell her side of the story on all of this.

r/gaming reached critical mass and self-moderation is no longer a valid option for quality control. [/r/gamernews]( is the closest to a solution.

lied about my past with my bf, he stopped trusting me and I became afraid of telling him things. He uncovered truths and the last argument we had involved name-calling and demeaning comments. Is it justified? I know I'm not the best person, but I'm at a loss right now, trying to better myself and I need a place to start.
Fat isn't cancer. A little bit is totally okay.
My "best friend" who I work with stabbed me in the back and now she's mad at ME for it.

Make it a social circle that doesn't focus entirely on the anime. You have every show that airs every season at your fingertips these days. They don't have to come to the club these days for it.   If you have any other questions, send me a PM. It's late and I gotta sleep :)
The app description makes unsupported claims. Sleep problems are known to have many causes other than the one the app says it prevents. Confusion with the placebo effect is a concern.

M in the Brosnan films is named Barbara Mawdsley, and in the Craig films is named Olivia Mansfield, meaning they are two different characters, throwing a wrench in evidence of the idea that James Bond is a codename because Judi Dench is M both pre- and post-reboot.
Still a terrible idea.
I've had a few shots of this booze, its got a kick, but it is not as hot as the manufacturer would lead you to believe. All in all, not very good.
Been dating Dan for 5 months. Made a new friend, Bob, in class the other day. Wouldn't mind being friends with Bob, but he just asked me out for coffee. Not sure what the boundaries are or how to handle this?   EDIT  So I texted my boyfriend & told him what happened, he laughed about it but told me he doesn't want me to go, so I'm gonna tell Bob I have a boyfriend so I can't get coffee with him. He'll probably get the hint and I guess we won't be friends after all, lol

Why follow a program that you need to modify every day? Look up your macronutrients and devise your own meal scheme. You don't  need  to evenly space the calories across meals.

Low income individuals (whom are making up an increasingly large segment of the population (don't even get me started on this...), simply do not have the money needed to pay more in taxes, while the rich (for the purpose of this discussion let's just pretend that's 150k+, because if you're living hand to mouth of that kind of paycheck you're not using your money wisely) perhaps don't have mounds of cash lying around, they can afford for uncle sam to take a larger slice without crippling them economically.
will the bank allow me to get a loan for a 2013 jeep srt8 that's being sold for 38k by trading in a 2015 Mazda 6 that I owe 21k on?   To clean it up a bit, I owe 21k even on the 2015 Mazda. And want to trade it in for a 2013 Jeep srt8 selling for 38k   This is in MA by the way.   EDIT- current credit score is 674
Ex was harassing me and stalking me after I broke up with him and spammed me and my close friends through calls/texts/social media. After I've blocked him on everything, he's gotten several of his friends to dislike and harass me on my YouTube videos and I'm not sure what to do now.   Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice. I'll definitely be talking to the police if anything else happens, and probably talking to the policeman at my school if the harass keeps happening on my videos (since that's the only way he can keep harassing/keep up to date with me).
Duo sucks at teaching Duo is good at EXPOSURE   Duo also seems to have some vapid fanbase that downvotes anything critical of the program, so it might be tougher to get real criticism acknowledged than if there wasn't the duo downvote army.
kissed a girl I've known for a while with no previous feelings for and went for the kiss using basic kino   Excuse my long paragraphs. But I felt like sharing this because I've become more aware of my actions as i'm doing them, and this was a great way for me to start.

I'm not trying to come off that way, I'm simply asking a bunch of makeup lovers in a makeup forum how to help someone I love make a change that I believe they want to make. I understand that there are way more important things in life - and my mom has LOADS of those things. Just trying to give her something a little extra. :)

Dated a SUPER confident smooth talker and learned from it the hard way!   Let me just add... There is nothing wrong with being an achiever and feeling good about yourself because of it. Its the people who make their self worth up entirely out of it that are the ones you have to look out for.   Edit: wrote this in one draft...

I may have gone a little too far offering a more mainstream perspective on a CF/tokophobic short story in college.  I'm an asshole, but I'm trying to learn to be a more manageable asshole.

yes it can be done but it won't be easy.   PS. you're gonna find it extremely hard to find anything cheaper than Chiang Mai when it comes to working online and having access to a proper support network.
By having the Master throw so many things at the Doctor, RTD writes himself into a corner where the only plot resolution can come from a stupid  deus ex machina  power shift in which thinking the Doctor's name undoes all of the effects of the Master's plan before a stupid  deus ex machina  reset button undoes the entire story.   Edit: I forgot to mention that the Toclafane are totally not just a cross between the Daleks and Cybermen. Flying roboticized humans with laser guns and no morals who exterminate people with no remorse. Even when an RTD finale doesn't feature the Daleks it features the Daleks. I guess there's still The End of Time.

Play for 40 hours, one night playing with friends and finally get far enough to build a real house, have over 500 ammo piled up with gear etc, die instantly, feel as if time and effort put into this game has absolutely no worth. 5 hours of work disappears in an instant.   edit: People think I am complaining about PvP because people are killing me. Instead of reading 3 lines of my post, why don't you read the entire thing before jumping to conclusions and accusing me of being a fucking moron? For those of you who still don't understand, I'm talking about the effort put in over several hours is not worth the outcome. 5 hours effort put in, and it takes 1 person and a gun to make your last 5 hours a complete waste of time. Now for the first handful of times this happens it is fine and I move on, but when it's the 500th time and finally I achieve something after several more hours of effort only for the same outcome again, I can't justify continuing.

Give her some time to get used to it and then try it with you, but if she doesn't, consider finding a GF who will.  One year isn't that long in the scheme of things.
If a guy messages you on facebook and has a conversation one day, talks to you a bit in the hallway of the school, and then when he joins in on you and your friend's conversation you stop talking, do you consider this guy to be creepy?

Am I missing something or is the Skywatch event really bugged? This community has helped guide me and my group through countless adventures, I ask of you, anyone know what's up??   ^^PunchOnGuardians   EDIT:  Skywatch Event: Defend Warsat OR Fallen & Hive war   Start Times: X:00-X:05 & X:30-X:35   Notes: This one is interesting. I'm not sure if it is entirely random or depends on the time, but sometimes rather than the Public Event occurring you will get a message saying something like, "The enemy is moving against each other" and the Fallen and Hive will send out waves of troops that get progressively stronger as time goes on. This will last for about 5 minutes. Also, this along with The Divide are my most tested areas.

My mom and I joined the same gym. She's obese, I'm small after losing 40lbs. She is very sensitive/defensive about weight and calorie counting now and her fatlogic is getting a bit stronger.
This game has no solo lanes so you're going to be stuck with a lane partner that may suck very often and puts not only himself behind, but yourself while at it.   Please note I am not hating on the two lane map. I love it. I just thought this expresses well why it is harder to carry when put into these matches with 4 lower skilled players than the enemy team and you being the equalizer.

So to conclude, "If I were to take a DNA swab of a transgender woman, what sex would the DNA results tell me she was? " It wouldn't. It tells you absolutely nothing. Phenotype is what is used in the determination of sex in human beings, and that includes everything from genitalia to endocrine system -- and even neurology. We're all real.   Here is more information for those that like to learn:   Genitalia is not the single factor used to determine sex either:   Total number of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female one in 100 births   There are all sorts of variations in humanity. We're all real.

It's irrelevant. Trenzalore will be made to never happen, and the TARDIS will not "actually" have to rest there forever, so who cares? There's literally no way that the writers can leave that event standing, regardless of how near or far it is in the Doctor's personal future. Might as well not worry about it.
My girlfriend is going out to a nightclub with some of her single girl friends. I don't know what these friends are like. She has no experience with guys, or drinking, or nightclubs. The one time she did go out drinking with me and others, she flirted with a guy and left me alone.

I liked Reach because the campaign made me cry/tear up far more often then 4, loadouts weren't as bad as they are in Halo 4 (perks n' stuff) and the armor in Reach actually looked like the Spartans fought in wars/battles and the forge was way better than H3's and still better then H4's.

This post is not the Holy Bible of Pop rarity either, so if you have anything to add please let me know or if I got anything wrong let me know too :D   P.S. - I promise that this is not directed towards any single individual <3

I highly doubt Calgary streets are going to be vacant,  given that a massive percentage of our industries are fueled by that very high gas price.  It didn't happen whatsoever between 2002 - 2008,  and there's no reason why we'd drop our cars during the next boom.   >c) what makes you think the profits from higher gas prices are going to be all that well spread out? Past history shows the vast majority of the new wealth will go to the top 5-10% of income earners, the income for the rest of the population will remain flat or decline, in real dollars, just as it has for the last few decades.   Did I say that they were going to be "well spread out"?  The point is that in aggregate Calgary continues to improve economically. Proof:   solid construction starts   and most importantly   Highest median income of the ENTIRE COUNTRY.   That's median,  not average either   So,  no,  we're not going back to the 18th century if oil booms again. Quite the opposite in Calgary.

Happy, mellow, stoned and uplifted. Not as body-heavy and "knocked-the-f-out" as Clonozolam (atleast not at 0.5MG).but i'd say more recreational. It makes me want to socialize, wich the Clonos don't. Weed analogy: fLam = Sativa. cLam = Indica heavy hybrid. Both messing up motor skills equally.   This is a very pleasant high, not so heavy, more dreamy, happy kinda. I might be back with a 0.75mg report mid/late next week, without any added depressants. Any suggestions to wich possibly to try next? I'm not big on the -Pam's, as i like to get fucked up the evening/night i take them, and be able to go to sleep like a zombie. I hear good stuff about the Etizolam aswell (not so much the deschloro one).   Will update on how i feel in the morning. when i have to get up - in 5 hours oO   Update : Nope, overslept it by 4 hours almost, feeling residual effects still, but slight. Mellowness and the "nocare" still around.
Probably just a cultural thing.

Significant other purposely kept information from me about a person she often sees and hangs out with and I am left hurt. Is this worth leaving over?
Told my parents I wanted help with long-standing depression, asking them exploded in my face, I wish I never asked in the first place.   Edit: I replied to everyone but it's not showing up? Sorry. Thanks for the advice and kind words. I'm going to try to figure this doctor stuff out on my own/ work up the courage to try at least. Maybe I'll reach out to a friend. For some reason that's almost as terrifying an idea as seeing a doctor =/

As a Cardinals fan, I feel so sorry for Braves fans and for Chipper! You guys had a hell of a season and Chipper a hell of a career. I'm just glad I was there to experience the insanity first hand.   I had a real late night and woke up at 2PM. I will be traveling home, but look forward to seeing the conversation when I get home.
Hero that is very situational, you need to draft team around him, farms and gets exp extremely quickly and fall off at same speed. Extremely good if you can play it and there is no counter - Not that good when he is not very far ahead.   Overall, high risk high reward pick.

The legality of unlocking your phone is  not  settled law.

It's rude and IMHO - it's a flagrant display of willful ignorance.   >In other words? Shut it. If you don't have time to read it, fine. Move on. But don't whine about it and ask others to summarize for you.   Did they never stop to think that this person has a learning disability and has trouble with reading comprehension and just wanted something they could understand   But no, its "Shut it. If you don't have time to read it, fine. Move on. But don't whine about it and ask others to summarize for you."

Asked girlfriend to stop being friends with those she has slept with, she's not happy about it.
Just because she is a girl doesn't mean she necessarily has ulterior motives for getting back in touch.
My FWB who acts like a boyfriend to me told me I should tell him if I ever catch feelings for him or don't like the way he treats me, so he could stop whatever because he doesn't want to make me feel bad because he doesn't like me back like that.  Should I tell him that I don't like how he is with me because it gives me butterflies?

I am not happy. I'm lonely, prone to fits of severe depression, and I'm living thousands of miles away from the only family who would care. I keep telling myself that I'm doing this to further my dreams of writing movies, but recently I've just begun to pine after going home and getting an apartment with my brothers, bartending, and going to grad school somewhere else. I want to talk to my parents about this, but I don't know what to do or how to start. I'm worried they'll think I'm giving up, but I'm struggling to be happy with even the smallest things, and I feel like I'm hitting a brick wall. I've started having suicidal thoughts again, and it worries me living pretty much alone like I do. I wish I could afford a therapist, but I'm also worried that no one will be able to give me advice. If there's anything anyone can offer, please do. I'm open to it.   For anyone who comments, thank you so much for wading through this wall of text. It means more to me than you know.

No one can prove or disprove a god exists. Believing in a god may not be the most logical conclusion but no one can say it flat-out isn't true. Denying evolution requires not only having no evidence (same as belief in a god) but additionally requires saying basically that science is wrong. Both beliefs have the same amount of scientific support but one actually argues against what is already scientifically supported.

You can't prevent these things, you can only find ways to positively impact some children's lives.   EDIT: Other thought:  If anything, it should be wrong to deny people sterilization if they request it.  The only place this is an issue in America is typically in a Catholic hospital, because they oppose birth control.  We've seen mothers who have delivered in a Catholic hospital and requested to have their tubes tied and been denied.
Dont assume a nobody is cheating just because they jump up the ranks fast.  They could actually be good.  Look for unusual deviations against other good players, that's more important.
Your game preferences are set in stone the first time you play (and thoroughly enjoy) a game of particular type, in addition to the age at which you play it. Take away that bias, and newer games are objectively better because they are built upon the foundations of older great games.

During two separate visits to a movie theater, a trailer that I was immediately suspicious of ended up being a screamer.  Family member who came with me was in the bathroom both times, rest of the theater was empty, and even later internet searches yielded nothing.   EDIT:  Seen some suggestions here that it could have been something put up by the theater, as opposed to being a trailer.  That would resolve at least part of the mystery, though I still find it strange how I was apparently the only person to see this not once, but twice.   EDIT 2:  A [YouTube video]( describes the same thing I saw - Thanks to /u/pandiculator for finding and sharing it.   EDIT 3:  The trailer does exist!

Always take up the opportunity to go out with people and make as big of an effort as possible to meet people.       P.S. Bring a deck of cards with you, great for drinking games.

As long as what I have fits within a single-bay Synology that’s backed up both locally and offsite, that’s pretty good, right?   Questions:   1) Does this sound like sound thinking/a solid setup to you?   2) Is there another solution in the cards that I’m not seeing? (For example, I could use the Synology for media storage only (~1.5TB) and keep the two external 5TB drives mirroring each other manually, perhaps with FDE. But then it becomes a question of file system compatibility, plugging stuff in at all times etc, the NAS certainly helps with all that.)   3) What can I do about file integrity/protection against bitrot with the current setup?   Thanks!

more of a rant than anything else. Ex and I were working on things, there were signs it was going nowhere that I took as just 'moving slowly'. As I type it out it's clear that we have nothing more than history and I've been tricked into chasing a ghost.   Edit : When I sat her down to tell her about the job she initially said "I don't want you to go..." and I asked "Do you honestly see this going anywhere in the future....?" She said "Yeah. I just need to work on myself right now. I can't do a relationship and focus on school etc. I want you to do what makes you happy though. It's selfish of me to ask you to stay" etc etc.   No there is no other guy

A was an aspiring actor, B was an established actor. Movie C needs an actor, A wanted the job badly but can't get it. One day B meets with an accident by crashing into D (who is driving on the wrong side of road) while driving recklessly in city, and is injured. D also had a big fight at home with his wife that day and is mentally unstable. Now that B is injured, A got the acting role in movie C. Credit goes to D's wife.

lost virginity in February of this year at 21 years old. have only had sex 3 - 4 times and have never been quite successful.  Doctor diagonsed it as performance anxiety. Looked up ways to get around it and am willing to try but i am interested in knowing if viagra would help get over this hump or if therapy would really help. There is also an issue that I have ADD so even though I know I should be focusing on the action,  thoughts slip into my mind of many different topics involving my performance/safety.

Stay calm and take control of the situation, you're going to see whatever you expect to see.
Set a clear frame for the fifth date, made it unquestionable that this was about sex.  She arrived, seemed nervous / bad body language.  Things heat up and she tells me she's on her cycle.  Move to the bedroom, tease her until she's begging for it, great sex.

We are still together. I have an appointment with a therapist. I will try to get lightness and fun back into our relationship. I hope that I will succeed and be more normal, and I hope that seeing my darkest side didn't scare him away completely.   Advice is still highly appreciated!       EDIT: Man, reddit. You got me thinking. Thank you all so much for answering! I never even thought my mood swings would be perceived as an actual mental illness. There were always people with way worse psychological problems around me, I worked with people who were going nuts because of fronto temporal dementia, my grandmother was bipolar type I, my stepdad threatens to kill himself every few weeks, my father was suicidal (he is fine now, he fell into a deep depression after my mom left him, just in case anyone wondered), my brother has terrible social anxiety, my best friend is bipolar type II, two of my aunts killed themselves.....  Compared to that I always seemed fine, a bit extreme maybe, but in a good way most of the time. I mean, I am a solid rock for quiet a lot of people.   For my boyfriend for example. My darknesss must have scared him shitless. Damn, I'm sorry. This man must love me, otherwise he would have run.   I will take care of this, it won't be easy, I read a lot about therapy and it seems that I have to expect at least a year of treatment and it sometimes gets worse before it gets better. And lying to the therapist is an absolute no-go, that will be the hardest part. But I will pull through that, I won't let my beloved ones go through what I have been through within my family.   THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I guess my advice is that it should be her responsibility to build up that trust again. If she's really interested in it, then she'll work for the friendship to succeed this time. Don't ignore her or avoid her, but don't go out of your way to make the relationship work. You tried that and it sounds like she took advantage of it. As much as it sucks to lose someone you were so close with once, if she's only a friend when it's convenient for her, she's not a friend.

I probably can't have kids. Coworkers are bugging me about when I'm having kids. Should I tell them I'm probably infertile, and if so, how?   EDIT: As I'm thinking this over, I really don't think infertility should be a taboo subject. If fertility is so openly talked about, then infertility should be, too! But I'm not sure everyone agrees with me on that. I'm all about "awareness" for things that people have trouble talking about, so I'm willing to be open about my health. But I'm not sure I can do it in a way where people's reactions won't be "Oh my gosh, I'm so, so sorry if I upset you" or something like that. Anyway, just wanted to throw that tangent in there.   EDIT #2: Wow! I'm really surprised and thankful for all the responses. I think I'm going to try to use it as an educational opportunity for my condition (endometriosis). I work in non-profit so I think they'll be receptive to that. We'll see. Thanks again, everyone! I truly appreciate it.

Edit: Some of you have suggested having a central community grinder to use at spawn or something... but if the decision is to do away with spawners, I feel we need to do it as an all or nothing deal. You all remember what happened when the US tried to 'ease' their way in to the metric system right? That was a mess :P But no, really I just would want it to be the same game experience for everyone...

She cheats on me, seems genuinely sorry. Is saving the relationship possible?   Edit: I'm not even crying at the moment. I was after she told me but know I'm just, just rational.

this is a two way explanation. Much of what I have noticed about what women are attracted to is pyschological. I've seen women date total fatasses and turn around to date a skinny guy, and back to fatass. Most of it seems personality and psychological.   Unless they are young and superficial.   Guys, those are the cheap bitches that you just fuck and toss, because that's what they have in mind for you  too.

She halfheartedly apologizes with an accusation that I'm trying to change who she is and won't accept her along with her flaws, which seems illogical to me.  I'm afraid this behavior and her argument won't change.  Typically, she is very cool about solving problems on the spot, but when she's on her period, it's completely different.

Using reasonable assumptions, you would need to play an average of 392 games to get enough cryptokeys to obtain what the new special contract gives you: a guaranteed weapon and 10 rare supply drops. This new contract system is exciting, guys.   EDIT: [Apparently the weapon bribe+10 rare supply drops contract is a one-time deal.]( Pretty disappointing. If they want people to be excited about the game, if they want to increase the ever-diminishing fanbase, they should implement a permanent solution that allows people to access game content in its entirety in a reasonable time frame. I thought the weapon-bribe contract would be a permanent addition to the game and a step in the right direction, but alas, it isn't meant to be. Whatever.   Footnote 1: The supply drop system can be modeled by a  binomial distribution  is   E(X) = μ = np   Substituting our supply drop values, we get:   1 weapon= n supply drops*0.0255 --> n = 1/0.0255 = 39.2 supply drops.

I was taken off 50mg Adderall XR per day because of adverse side-effects, but no other medication works as good as Adderall did. I'm too scared to talk to my doctor about it, but I honestly think it's the best medication for me.     Also, I should add that as soon as I was taken off of the Adderall, the amounts of classes that I skipped dramatically increased, my overall cleanliness severely deteriorated, and my grades suffered a great-deal.

if you are premade and play with your firends normal games try not to flame the remaining member of your team who is not premade with you because he might have feelings and might just want to stop playing thanks to you, instead of actually trying to win.

Opacity has a clear minimum, maximum and a clearly defined function for every point inbetween. Colour instead is composed of a spectrum of different wavelengths, with no absolute maximum.   Opacity is something completely independent of colour, actually. They have nothing in common with each other.   But it would still be interesting to see a combined selector, because sometimes it would make sense. For example for window colours or text colours.

version of that argument is that it is valid, and it features an undeniable first premise and a second premise it would be rather silly to deny (though many have tried). The options available given a valid argument are to deny premises, and as one is airtight and the other seemingly airtight, the onus is on you to supply a plausible rejection of it. Good luck?

Riot over the last 8 months has taken a fairly balanced approach to buffing/nerfing champions.  Rarely nuking anything from orbit.  Similar results when looking at items.  Game play post 3.10 tends of improved (my opinion), however it is not flawless.   Edit: Words and removed my big rant.   Editx2: Missed a couple minor buffs/nerfs from the patch with Jarvin's flag and drag nerf.   Edit x3: Some stuff to Janna/Sona under the reworks.   Edit Common comment 1:   The magnitude of buffs/nerfs are approximately the same (purely subjective).   A straight buff would dramatically improve a champion just as a straight nerf would (in theory, first Elise nerf clearly did not go as planned) dramatically hurt a champion.  Even many of the hefty nerfs are not necessarily giant things, the Fiddle nerf was his fear duration, the Teemo nerf was the hit his shroom took.  The Kog'maw buff is the one that is going to be nerfed next patch (my prediction) because that shit is OP.  Similarly using Gragas as an example his targeted buff was body slam dealing full damage to all affected units, his targeted nerf were the toning down of the barrels.  These were changes that were definitively buffs/nerfs, but they had only slight or in some cases for the buffs/nerfs unnoticeable changes to the champions.   Edit Common comment 2:   The buffs are just to offset Nerfs   Generally this is false.  I used  patch 4.2 .  However it contains two notable nerfs those to Ziggs and Yasuo, both of which are nerfs in reaction to over BUFFING champions.  It is important to realize that things work both ways with buffs/nerfs, and true thorough testing occurs on live, because the test realm has all sorts of things going on it is not a clear indicator.  Think of it like shooting at a target, if you miss wide left, you adjust to the right.  Maybe your next shot is still wide left so you adjust more to the right, or maybe your shot is now to far right so you nudge it back to the left, or maybe just maybe you hit the bullseye so you let it go.
This shit is complicated; try to understand the studies and how they might apply to you before relying on their results. Sorry for the rant.

of everything, you don’t have to read anything else: What do 20-somethings wear? What are some tips I can use to tell if a shirt is more for older women? What should I aim for? Are there places/brands I should shop to avoid “getting my wires crossed” so to speak (like JC Penny’s)? I’m not really coming here to become a fashionista, but I figure you all probably know more about clothes than most people and so may be able to provide some “technical” guidance.   Some further elaboration:   I’ve gone through a few catalogs and picked out some tops that I might say “yes” to and I expect other people would shake their head no to. I’m not sure what makes them cue “old”.   I also don’t know what to aim for in their place.   I’m basically wearing this shirt right now:  but with black sleeves and have no idea why it’s probably not age appropriate.
After 4 dates with a new guy, we had sex (I initiated it) and an awkward sleepover. It's my first time sleeping with someone outside the context of a relationship. Since then, I'm super anxious about what he thinks of me, and keep telling myself I blew my chances by being sexually aggressive. In my last relationship, I was obsessed with my boyfriend and felt similar unease, but thought I had moved past this issue. Why does sleeping with someone for the first time change how I feel about them?

So all she has is a snickers waiting on her for christmas. She's going to hate me!   UPDATE:  By coke I mean the drink. Coca-Cola..! Can barely type, I'm laughing so hard.   Ok, last Update and I'm off my friends reddit.  I told my gf the story, and she started laughing before I could even finished, and when I finally did, she fell down laughing.

4 weeks ago a guy on POF contacts me, asks to go for coffee. I asked to get to know him better first. We msged each other and hit it off. He asks for my number, we text regularly for 2 weeks. We have a lot in common and he asks to treat me to food sometime during early/mid Feb. I text back ‘yes! Let’s set something up!” I ask him for deets, and he never replies back. It’s been 9 days. Longest he’s taken to reply ever. I find out he’s on POF daily, and just ignoring me. Do I text him? Or try to move on? I really want to know if I did something wrong. Don’t think I’ll seriously considering dating this guy or being his friend anymore though. (Too hurt and don’t want to seem desperate/pathetic/stupid) Need perspective and advice please!!   We've known each other about 4 weeks now.

I have no idea what I'm talking about. Margaret of Anjou's pretty interesting tho.   Also...   >Now granted, I'm pretty sure the whole point of this commercial is to see Flo constantly get in over her head and hilariously executed.   My immediate reaction to that was "sounds like fetish fodder!" and I'm not sure what that says about me and/or about how much time I've been spending on the Internet lately.

Keyfobs won't do anything to you that more powerful signals already have.
having characters fight for survival in the face of brutal and horrible injuries is good drama, and common throughout the series. Focusing too much on this instance just seems like a cheap excuse to hate on the show.

Bad divorce plus semi-abusive relationship left me terrified of serious relationships. Desperately want to get married and start a family but also terrified of being abandoned.

yes, I think it's completely doable for middle-class individuals to raise kids without going into debt, but they'll have to be smart with their budgeting, prioritizing, financial planning, and money management from the get-go. Being able to distinguish between wants, needs, and nice-to-have-but-not-essentials is key.

Father fucked up his life, most of which is his own fault (being terrible with finances).. He lives off my welfare ($700/mo) and I have given him a deadline for which I am cutting him off regardless of his job situation. I also feel that he does not believe I will cut him off, so he is going to essentially play 'financial chicken' and not get a job and live off of me bc he thinks I wont kick his ass to the curb.   QUESTION: What do I do? Am I being too harsh? I feel that 18 months is an adequate amount of time to get a job. I have a strong resentment for him since he did not help me at all financially once my mother passed away bc he said he had no money (a lie), yet he was paying thousands for his gold-digging girlfriend's tuition, rent, allowance, etc. along with cosigning an $18,000 loan for my sister (which she now refuses to pay and is sticking him with the bill). I didnt mind him not paying for any of my schooling bc I understood why, but since I have found out that it was a lie so he could give money to his gf and my sister, I am not too happy about it... Especially since I have +$200K in student loans and I am paying ($700/mo) for him to essentially sit on his ass doing nothing all day.   What should I do reddit?
Parents are divorcing, I am an adult and should be able to handle it, but apparently I have shut down instead.   Edit: Well, I am out of milk/Oreos so I'm just going to head to bed I guess. I apologize for sounding so dramatic about something that, statistically speaking, a lot of people go through. I realize that my situation is very normal and does not merit any special pity, I just don't/didn't know how to handle what I was feeling. I'll be okay, I think I just needed to vent to nobody.
how do adults end friendships without phasing out? What do people do? I am so confused.

So like... 3 male 1.5 women   > Violence and gender are not mutually exclusive. It can be both.   True but I think its more like  VIOLENCE  ^^and ^^gender rather than treating them on the same plane.

Just because you don't have physical scars doesn't mean there isn't domestic abuse

Whether you think about it or not, you rely on faith sometimes, but there is a such thing as reasonable faith.   Discuss.   Edit: I'm not comparing these situations to religious faith or saying that I think religious faith is justified, I don't think that at all.  I am just being critical of people on r/atheism who go crazy whenever they see the word faith without considering that it might not be referring to religious faith or any sort of blind faith.  I meant this to be a discussion about semantics

It seems like part of the problems on TSM are players not stepping up (Turtle/Amazing/Dyrus at times) and the other part (a much bigger part) comes from lack of strategic soundness before even entering the game (pick/ban phase, inability to adapt to certain champs ie: Rengar/Zilean/Nidalee).
My boyfriend's mother committed suicide recently and tomorrow is her birthday. He has had a really hard time with his loss, despite the tumultuous relationship he had with her. Should I make a kind gesture for him (and her) on her birthday? And if so, what should I do?

The software example just goes to show that actual manufacturing cost is all but irrelevant.

Looking for a nice guild on Darkspear and patient people to help me figure out what is going on in Arenas, preferably from Darkspear as well :) Have no idea what to do right now and don't know where to go next to improve myself.   Edit1: Wow I am so surprised to get so many comments! Thank you Reddit! Reading some of these comments really made my heart warm up a bit. To answer some comments, I am on Darkspear US, and I did not use the level 90 boost, I leveled my DK up by hand at lv55. I am not here to gain sympathy and cry about the community. I'm here to try to make some buddies and improve on my own gameplay. I (think I) know my own class rotations, AND what the skills do, Outbreak, Howling Blast, Plague Strike, Pillar of Frost, Obliterates. I even know that sometimes that when you put Dark Sim on a mage in Ice Block you can sometimes steal a blink or two. What I do not know, is focus (Focus Resto Druid or Blood DK/Tank spec)major cooldowns of other classes, and I think the mechanics of my gameplay. It seems like I always lose in arenas and I just want to know why I'm losing games.   Edit2: I just wanted to add that I've been through the whole lv100 grind and the gank fest in Stranglehorn...fun. My first character was a rouge, but I didn't like the playstyle, so when I hit level 55, I decided to try a DK, and BAM, I instantly fell in love with it, and I chose Frost because it sounded cool, not because they're OP, I didn't know anything back then. Furthermore, thanks to all the comments and two people adding my battletag I managed to finally win 9 or 10 arena matches after maybe 20 losses, guess I just had extremely bad luck :)   Edit3: OH MY GOODNESS GOLD, thank you reddit, after seeing all this encouragement a tear dropped down my cheek...looks like there are still awesome people playing the game <3

It's complicated. Some types of radiation are better at damaging organisms, especially when taken internally. Potassium 40 in bananas, for example, is pretty weak compared to Cesium-137 or Strontium-90. If I have to choose between one of those, give me the bananas all day every day, I'm not even worried! The Cs and Sr would worry me, though. But I'm also not worried about airplane rides or the occasional doctor's X-ray.   Ask people that compare dangerous isotopes like iodine or cesium to bananas and airplane rides what they'd rather have: a banana smoothie on an airplane ride every day for a year or a nice glass of cesium 137 ice tea of equal activity level.

It is sort of silly to describe light as a particle.   > ...   [Source for the quotes](   > Perhaps the most recent is this quote from W.E.

Radiation does not consist of particles  and the classical, i.e., non-quantum limit of QTR is described by Maxwell’s Equations for the EM fields, which do not involve particles.”

I don't think any smart extraterrestrial would be the first to make the journey.  First we would run into space mice.   [edit]  As to what I would do, try to kill it.  Probably run for some back-up first but I would kill the shit out of it and send the remains to smarter people than myself to figure out just what the hell it is.
of this would be that  it doesn't make sense to compare humans and computers . Computers excel in areas that humans fail at - speedily computing unambiguous instructions. Humans excel at something that computers can't do at all*: synthesis of information.   *Caveat: computers can  simulate  this through artificial intelligence, but that's different from being able to synthesize information the way humans do.

Deflationary policy would utterly destroy the economy.  I hope I was able to explain why in a fashion you can understand.   >It basically punishes financially prudent individuals by eroding the value of their savings and investments.  This slows down the wealth accumulation process for everyone if anything.   It does no such thing.  The investors and businesses are going to be much worse off in a contracting economy than they would be in an expanding economy.   >That is why one salary was enough to sustain a household in the past and now even two people aren't enough unless they have decent jobs.   It is a LOT more complicated than that.

awing multiples feels awful though, so I don't run 4.   Land(s) Justification :   This deck could probably use some more white sources, as I've upped the number of white spells recently. 3 Urborgs are necessary with the heavy black commitment and the number of lands that do not produce any color (esp. DD). The only "utility" land I run is Karakas to hate Sneak and Show. If I cut some number of DD I could probably afford to slot in Maze of Ith or other utility lands, but I think the deck wants to be LESS durdly.     SB Choices   The sideboard has been giving me the most headache, as I arguably am awful at making them. I feel that some cards are too narrow, and others not narrow enough. I welcome any suggestions. Possible inclusions are Toxic Deluge, Nihil Spellbomb, Choke, Perish, Ratchet Bomb, Engineered Explosives, Bojuka Bog, etc.   1 Krosan Grip :   Used for: Sneak and Show, Blood Moon (Mox Diamond), Omnitell, D&T, Tezzeret, probably High Tide.   1 Manriki Gusari :   Used for: D&T, Stone/Deathblade, UWR Delver (SoFaI version)   1 Gaddock Teeg //1 Ethersworn Canonist :   Used for: Any combo really, Elves!   3 Thalia, Guardian of Thraben :   Used for: Combo, Sneak & Show, Shardless BUG (blocks well and hampers cascade)   2 Surgical Extraction :   Used for: Combo, Dredge. At times brought in vs RUG to deny them of Trops, but that's always seemed sloppy. Wonder if this should just be Spellbomb or MBT.   2 Thoughtseize :   Used for: Combo/Miracles.   1 Golgari Charm :   Used for: TNN mainly, but also Sneak & Show, D&T, Elves!, Goblins, etc. I would run more as I like it better than Plague for all the above reasons, but it interacts extremely poorly with my own Confidants & Hexmages.   1 Engineered Plague :   Used for: Same as above (minus S&S) but doesn't kill my own guys and is permanent.   1 Grafdigger's Cage   Used for: Elves!, Dredge   1 Swords to Plowshares   Used for: Any creature/fair matchup.     Matchups   Favorable:   RUG Delver:   Decay their threats, Waste them out, and they have zero main-deck outs to a Marit Lage.   Shardless BUG:   Waste them early and often with Thalia in for g2/3 to prevent them from drawing back in. Hexmages mow down their Jaces. They may have a stronger CA engine than you, but you are better suited to win the grindy game. Save StP or Decay for Goyf and Jitte can handle all their other 1/1s and 2/2s. Most BUG lists are down to 1 LotV and so lack sufficient MD answers to Marit Lage.   Jund:   Same as BUG but more susceptible to Wasteland locks. Save at least 1 waste for grove as punishing fire can be annoying when trying to establish a Jitte.   Stone/Deathblade :   Similar to BUG, but with possibility of an annoying TNN. Waste them out and save Lili for the merfolk. Jace is cold to Hexmage (their only out is FoW). They have few answers to a huge KotR.   Manriki Gusari in from SB to deal with equipment and appropriate hate for TNN.   50/50 matchups:   UWR Delver:   The mainboard StP makes the MU a bit more difficult as Marit Lage is no longer an autowin. They're also faster than Stone/Deathblade but still have the annoying TNN. It is difficult for them to beat a resolved LotV, so that is our endgame.   Elves!:   Attacking their hand early and killing everything. Much better after SB.   Death & Taxes:   Your Diamonds allow them to never control your mana, so as long as you keep up with their mother of runes you will grind them out. Due to Karakas/StP you'll never attempt Marit Lage and instead beatdown with 8/8 KotRs. They'll side RiP in g2/3 but your SB of creature hate should roll them and allow your equipment to take over.   Bad Matchups   Miracles:   Honestly haven't tested it, but as a former miracles player I know LotV is very hard to beat. Abrupt Decay answers RiP and Counterbalance.   Storm/Combo :   Can get lucky pre-board with hymn + early Marit Lage. Post board we pack a TON of hate and shouldn't have issues.     Wrap Up   That's the list. I know it's not perfect, but it seems like it answers all the usual problems with Dark Depths while keeping it as a core of the deck (unlike Lands.dec that slots it in). Advice on the sideboard is welcome and I'm willing to speak more in depth on certain MUs in comments. Thanks!

A lot has changed in practice in recent years. It's an easy target for polititians to look strong. It's more complicated than you might think, because privacy is a big issue for our side, and the easy solutions other nations want us to adapt are very bad for privacy.   lot's of edits for grammar, killed the first paragraph
Instinct is powerful and the boundary between it and love is indistinct. Therefore people say parental love is powerful.

Met this girl, strong connection, great sex.. we moved too quickly and apparently I am overlooking her crazy tendencies and her strange persona.

EDIT: Alright, well I don't see this topic taking off from here. I mean, it's only been an hour but with only 4 upvotes I don't see this topic being seen by many more people. Thanks for those who've given advice. Every single one of your suggestions seem like things worth pursuing. These'll definitely help make me a more wellrounded and interesting person :D

I have quite a lot of experience with having a mother with bipolar, and it's all good and well saying 'fuck politicians' because mental healthcare isn't good enough, and I agree with that. However, also one key thing that must change is society's general attitude towards mental health. In my experience people either still don't take it seriously, or think people are just 'putting it on', and it must change for progress to be made.
I hope this rule will be changed.

any combat soldier that jumps out of plane to get to a fight faster is intense, and this guy with his motor bike did two tours in a country under a regiment that just did that- that's intense! Sorry for blabbing I had no idea of this guys history and if I saw him, I most likely would of thought he was some kind of hipster- and how very wrong I would of been! Shows a personal flaw I have to fix, even in death this guy is teaching lessons.   Edit: I'll add I put "soldier" because a true Canadian soldier doesn't do that shit those idiots did, people can say what they want about the army but shit like that isn't promoted at all and isn't acceptable at any level- we all learned  quick there is a moral standard that is not only promoted but enforced and you don't want to be that guy/guys who break it, or you will  end thanking the MPs for arresting you quickly and putting you in a safe cell.

From your comments, it looks like you don't have a kid of your own. Kids change your life to such a degree, that if you want a non-resentful partner, you shouldn't trick your husband into being a father.
My advice, go as is for a bit, talk if it really bothers you and just talk about what you want but be understanding to what he wants as well, he's not using you he just needs a good friend right now and it's awesome that you are that.
The French army was typical of a colonial army (big navy and relying on infantrymen, no tech), France was surrounded by hostile governments with no reliable ally. I don't think the valliance of our grandfathers was in cause, more the political choices, poor decision-making and geopolitical situation. Interesting books are Marc Bloch's  Strange Defeat  and de Gaulle's  Memoirs  (which are obviously not objective).   EDIT: see corrections on the number of tanks below.

Church lies, God doesn't judge you by doings, but by love. God allows everything except disbelief and suicide (along with 10 rules). It is called belief because we BELIEVE, we don't need God to show himself to us. There are 2 types of Christians, Catholics and Orthodox, Orthodox being the hated ones. If you don't read and study the Bible, you can't judge us. Judging Christians by some 12 years old idiots is stupid.

Firefly meets Disney's Treasure Planet with Dragons and Magic.
Because of how power used to divide people into social classes. Most state positions were linked with social status and as such were reserved for the nobility or the church. No titles were allowed for the middle-class other than functional titles within the government of  towns (mayor, councilor, alderman) and definitely no titles were allowed for functions involved with trade which was considered a disgraceful profession. So it was a formal ban on titles in business that shaped the language for the first few centuries and it carried on to this day.

Neither Sony nor Codemasters is willing to fix the problem with their VIP Pass DRM. Instead they tell the customer to "Pay for a new VIP Pass through the Playstation Store" to resolve the issue at hand. Sony blames Codemasters, Codemasters blames Sony, neither of them will actually resolve the issue at hand.   If anyone has some useful tips, I am more than willing to listen. This has been a frustrating process that has made me think that I should never buy another Codemaster product, nor buy anything through the Playstation Network ever again. :(   Thanks for listening to me rant.

drug development be expensive for a reason.
My girlfriend (22) loves me (22) and our relationship (6 months or so) but recently has told me that she's not feeling like I'm her best friend, and I agree that that is an essential part of a relationship that I apparently suck at and I don't know what to do. Neither of us want to break up and my heart is falling out of my ass right now. Please grace us with your wisdom.
I feel ya, bro
I have a roommate who thinks that having more than a few tattoos means you can't be successful, and I am curious how many people consider themselves successful who have numerous tattoos and what you do for a living.
My very impulsive friend wants to marry her boyfriend of less than a year by next month, doesn't think divorce is a big deal if it comes to it, and I'm afraid her parents may kill her as they financially support her 100%.
Life sucks. And then you die.   EDIT: Grammar.
Jesus is not an oppressor.  The devil wants you to think freedom can only be had outside religion.  The reality is just the opposite.  I needed to realize that before I could kneel before Jesus in good conscience, without feeling like God would need to hit my knees with a baton.  Now I do it willingly and joyfully, if yet a bit tentatively.  Jesus is Lord.

No Churchill for the UK, UK loses, US is neutral in WWII, Axis win WWII, start developing nuclear arms after they won to conquer the rest of what's free in the world.   The game is pretty weak overall, not "horrible", just cliché, the game was very much ignored and got reviews like 5.7/10, 4.1/10, 2/5, etc.   Of fucking course, lots of wrong things here, let's see if we can do something realistically, well, do you guys know what's the most "realistic" axis victory map?

s because it's clear that you feel personally attacked and are unwilling to examine something you love a little more critically, and so you lash out at me. That's fine. That's an understandable response. You don't have to stop going there. Just don't pretend that loving those stories makes you any better than the people on /r/fatpeoplehate.

Utilitarians believe that the end justifies the means (It's OK to do wrong if it gets good results).  Kantians believe that the end cannot justify the means (Good results are meaningless if you did wrong to achieve them).  This debate takes place not only between great philosophers, but in the sphere of public policy as well (expressed as Liberalism versus Conservatism).

What are your thoughts on "gimmicks" in Fantasy?   What twist on an old tale - or entirely new idea altogether - makes you pick up a book?  Or are gimmicks stupid (regardless of whether or not they're "trendy")?   What's your gimmick?   How is your story different from other Fantasy tales?  Why should I read your thing instead of the next commenter's thing?   What do you do that's the same?  What elements of your story will I find comfortably familiar?  If I liked LotR, Harry Potter, ASOIAF, Narnia, will I also like your book?   What do you think is the right balance between freshness and familiarity?   Is there one?  Or are we more likely to create something Totally New OR Nostalgic?     End note: "gimmick" has lost all meaning.
we need to accept art as subjective - something can have differing levels of value to different people. Value is a useless concept in this regard.

is that most women do and some don't. If you get one that doesn't, and you do, bad luck. Good thing there are more out there.   A woman doesn't have to submit to fit into the leadership model. In fact, she won't. That's what the existence of shit tests do. They're an attempt to overthrow the leader. By 'passing' them, you maintain leadership. This is seen as attractive and raises your SMV. If you fail, she goes and finds a man that can handle her. Maybe you can live quite a happy life as a co-leader, or even an underling. But, unless you got lucky with the snowflake machine, you won't be attractive and the sex and relationship will suffer.   It isn't easily provable, no. However, the alternate hypothesis of everyone being perfectly equal, with the snowflake machine running on perfect variance is considerably more absurd. We know that there are differences in male and female biology. We can observe that certain traits are attractive to each gender. We cobble together the best that we can, with the goal of helping each other.   Regarding hippies:   Leadership doesn't mean micromanagement. He may be quite content to be mellow and delegate tasks. But he should have a clear idea of what he wants and take steps to achieve it. Being decisive is the aim. He should be able to say yes or no to his woman with confidence. Perhaps things really are different in that subculture, or perhaps they aren't. I can't comment, not being a hippie. What other examples?

Put bluntly, Indigenous groups do not have higher rates of alcoholism because  they're not use to it , they have high rates because they occupy socio-economic positions that always have higher rates.

stop being such haters. Qatar has a lot of legitimate problems but these problems are NOT unique to Qatar and are NOT unique in a World Cup host country. Many of the arguments used to hate on Qatar are nonsensical or just thinly veiled hatred of Arabs and Muslims. I expected more from Reddit and it's really a terrible shame.   Let the flames commence.

Friend and I have been blowing eachother off to hang out alone for an upwards of 8 months. She escalated physically this weekend, I ask her to chill, but no response :/ Do I keep hitting her up, or give her space?   Update:  So i called twice, and no answer.  I then texted her, asking for a date tomorrow.  Still no response, and I doubt I'll be getting one.  Oh well. No regrets, right?

I'm pretty pathetic, woe is me. The way I am feeling is totally irrational, but I can't stop it. I don't have the strength of feeling to care that much about anyone else but myself, but for some reason I think you should all take off time from your busy schedules to feel sorry for me and comfort me because I'm lonely, my ego is hurt, and I hate myself for not being able to get everything that I want that other people I know have.

I chose not to have kids because (among other things) I don't have nor want to spend that kind of money. I certainly don't want to pay to raise someone else's shitty kid.
there is no substitute for spending time in the shark pit - you will get your ass handed to you repeatedly but if you're smart -  you will learn from each hand you lose .  Another very important aspect to playing live poker - you MUST have the bankroll to cover it.  When you have money in the bank and could literally almost care less about the money that you are putting on the table - your game becomes MUCH more confident.  When you are playing with $80 and you only have $400 in the bank... you're gonna be scared.

Once I've detected edges with Sobel, what should my next step be along the object recognition path? Thanks!   Edit: Just a quick mention, if Sobel is inadequate or I'm missing a step that information would be greatly appreciated. I'm not 100% sure that my images are ready for feature extraction based on the processed image I've included. If it isn't, what steps need to be taken before I can extract features and identify the playing card in code?   2nd Edit: Just another edit, using Otsu's Thresholding I was able to very clearly define the playing cards from the surface, so I'm not sure edge detection is even required. But that still leaves my problem, where do I go from here!? SIFT/SURF? How should I approach the problem of feature extraction!?
Nose: wet oak, beef jerky, honey mustard, thick maple syrup, toasted marshmallow, pepper, brown sugar.

people look at items to know how strong someone really when it comes to AD/AP and not some really high numbers that change at every back, looking at items + Q stacks helps more than calculating how much damage his total burst will do with 843 AP, if you don't have the exact same build calculating how strong he is is really annoying (given his speciality is oneshotting there's no room for mistakes), also they tested it on Nasus and concluded that it was better if other team and teammates could see it too when they implemented his Q's thing, it's only fair Veigar gets the same treatment, plus the variable is already shown in game, they just have to put it as a buff, work done.   (Also, game is not about theorycrafting during a fight, it's about looking at the other's strenght and reacting to it quickly. You think "Riven has a BF, that's a lot of AD, like 45, so she spent 1550 golds more than I do, yeah that can't go well, better not go", and not "oh, she has 140 ad, that means her combo with every passive stack used will do around 240 (+2.1 bonus AD) + 50 (+ 1 bonus AD) + ~80 to 100% total AD and her shield will have a total value of 90 (+ 1 bonus AD) ! wait I forgot she has ult, let me add 20% AD and the ult damage...", nobody does it).   Edit : inb4 "that will be exploited !" wtf ??? inb4 I can't do a first grade addition, yes I can, though calculating his runes/masteries/looking at how much his build grants him and how much mine does then adding 30% + 5 potential % then calculating if his burst will kill me with my MR in a few seconds is stupid, items mean much more to me... if only I could know how much bonus AP he has with that.

The Velox 2 leak was a huge scam run completely by /u/WakeUpToChrist. All users and developers should be aware that he is not exactly a nice dude, and should  never  use him for beta testing. I suggest you read it though, it's a pretty cool CSI-criminal catching story with some memes thrown in there ;p   EDIT: Since this hit the front page of /r/bestof (which is awesome btw!) there are a couple things I'd like to mention for those unfamiliar with /r/jailbreak:     A tweak is an extension for jailbroken iOS devices that extends the functionality of iOS itself or an app on your device.     Velox 2 is an upoming tweak. [Here's a video of it in action (which is also a good example of what a tweak can do)](     A deb is Debian package, you can think of it like an installer package. That is the way packages are managed on jailbroken iOS, so giving someone a deb is synonymous with giving them a copy of the tweak/package.     I am not the developer of Velox 2, that would be /u/Codyd51. I help out with development some, and helped out with messing with this leaker :)

A split damage weapon will do more damage when the average resist is lower than it's pure physical counterpart if damage is equal between the two weapons.  In the vast majority of cases, a split weapon will deal higher damage, as it's overall AR is much higher than a single damage weapon.  Yes, there is a chance that your weapon will due less depending on what absorption values different players have.  However, the vast majority of armors available for the first half of the game are not balanced and either neglect physical or elemental damage.  This means that for someone with high physical absorption, a pure physical weapon will not do well and the split attack will be very effective.  Someone with high elemental absorption will still take heavy damage from both weapons.  Only when the average resistance to a particular weapon is higher than the pure physical will a pure damage weapon do more.   If anyone wants to correct my damage formula assumptions or give stats of their character's defense levels, I'd be more than happy to add proper examples or calculate it all out for various damages.  The phrase, "split damage goes through more resists and is therefore not as good" doesn't at all take into account how percentages work.  There is either a secondary damage formula or people just generally suck at math.
the 'rules' such as movement speed, terrain collision, ability effects or ability cooldowns are all enforced on  your  personal computer. This means  you  can bend them to  your  will.

Should I try and adapt p90x3 routines, and just ensure I'm hitting all the muscles logically? Is there some other program I should explore?

Society hates you, so dont try to change who you are just to please them. Only other pedos will understand and accept you.   Be with the ones who love you, not with the ones who wish you the worst and want to kill you. That is simply plain common sense.

My Father is a low life piece of sh#t that needs help. He helps other kids out who are not even his blood, but won't help out his own family. Will buy my Sister anything but I need to work for my stuff, and my Brother doesn't get anything from him.   No throwaway because I hope he finds this, because maybe it will open his eyes about how much I hate him now.

I submit that racism, while historically associated with skin color (especially in Americal), in no way  requires  skin color. All that's required is a mixture of loss and resentment, combine with the apparently human need to blame (or scapegoat)  someone  (regardless of whether or not it's true).   Blanket statements (All [race] do [thing]...) and sweeping generalizations (you people) are warning signs that thinking may be affected.
I greatly empathize with you and your father.

I have a brain the capacity of a rodent, and the discipline of Aesop's grasshopper. Somehow I weaseled my way into a top engineering school with a scholarship. Now that I am at school, I've crossed the event horizon, and there is no amount of energy in the universe that could pull me out of this hole. I'm going to fail out of college. I'm going to kill myself.

Today will be my third day on Cipralex if I take the pill again at night. The first day was fine, the second day I had a big panic attack due to this "weird feeling" in my head I've had since I started taking the pill.

no, a 160 is not a good score.  Using the metrics of 80th percentile of test takers or 85th percentile of test takers is rather meaningless because it doesn't account for school medians.  It's best to look at where your LSAT score falls in relation to your target school's medians to better understand how you performed.   Ideally, no one should be "satisfied" and keep a lower score.  People should be striving to do the best that they possibly can because the LSAT directly affects your career trajectory and life path.  5 right or wrong answers can mean the difference between a life of sticker debt at a lower T50 school with a low-paying job afterward or a nice scholarship to a T20 school with a better-paying job.  People often don't understand this and tend to be more short-sighted.  They think, "Man, I'm sick of studying for this test.  I'll just take this score and go."  it's disappointing, especially considering how this test is so learnable with the proper amount of time.

What's the best solution for filling matches while not having to always join matches late. Possibly have a cooldown if you just joined a game late can't join a game in progress for X hour(s) or game(s). When joining a game our supers should be as if we were in the game the whole time alive similar to Titanfall. Mercy rule should be enforced more easily when people leave at anytime. What's your solution?   EDIT: I do wonder the complications of certain tiers and ability to swap while flying in how that'd be with how your super would be. Maybe when you touch the ground or at X time. It based off that and fills your super. I have no idea how hard any of this would be to implement.

I understand that pitbulls are very gentle, sweet, and loving dogs, but I think a certain degree of wariness about such a large and muscular dog makes sense to me. Why is this breed more zealously defended than other breeds, and is it simply because this dog gets more attention than others?

Everyone and their mothers probably didn't own one but it did become more and more common the later you look at. But that question cannot be answered by a simple yes or no simply because the middle ages last about 1000 years and things changed a LOT during that thousand of years.   Now, I don't have all my sources on hand because they were documents showed to me years ago, but if needed I can try to dig up as many of them as I can. I can sure as hell dig up the fighting manuals that the masters wrote though if anyone is interested.

I'm just making a statement about the focus of the "Make FIRST Loud" movement.

Wenger will choose his own time. I think we should have more patience for this current core of players. Injuries happen, more to us than others, but that doesn't seem like something that can be changed overnight or even in the first 8 matches of a season. I will wait to make judgment at the end, but I expect improvement from last season and will call this new project of Wenger's a failure if we are not one of the best offensively producing teams by May and have tightened up in defense by then.

I feel like I'm being bullied by one of the gyms "pretty girls" and am uncertain of how to react.
start here:   When fixing a Quickbooks issue on the boss's computer, I learned that the other phone techs were making as much as I was. One guy who started after me (but was older than me) was making a good deal more. Needless to say, I wasn't too happy. I felt that I was a much better phone tech than the others, and did the stuff that they refused to do (field work and training). But I was still being paid as an entry-level guy (I had been there 8 or 9 years at this point). I did get raises over that time, but so did they.   The moment came  when my boss hired a contractor to come in and redesign the company's website, that I had been maintaining for a few years at that point. I believe he paid well over $3000, the site looked like shit, and I had to fix a few things afterwards that didn't work.   I spoke with my boss at one point, and he basically told me there was no money to give me a significant raise. I plead my case, he gave me an insignificant increase, and I started looking for new jobs.   When I did get a new job, I went back to the other senior tech that was still there, and suggested he apply at my new job. He did, and got hired. My old boss did nearly everything he could to stop him from leaving, even offering him to become a co-owner or something to that extent. But the other tech left, and ended up being a valuable asset to the team at my new job.

I nearly stuck my head into a large patient's vagina.   EDIT:  It sure as hell looked like semen.  It was a dry, crusty, and sticky substance.  I'm no doctor by any stretch of the imagination, but she may have had some condition that causes involuntary ejaculation.  Or maybe my ruggedly handsome good looks were too much for her.   EDIT 2:  Guess what I saw was vaginal discharge, because she was not being taken care of.  Told ya I was no doctor.

If there are ways to include them then I wouldn't mind trying it out. Keeping that amount of players on track during roleplay could be hard. I think with so many players- emphasis will definitely have to be on roleplay. Combat is going to have to be meaningful. I don't feel like running a large combat works too well. It get's way too bogged down. Running combat with less monsters is always an option- I just don't want it to be the norm. Session after session with a big monster or a key monster and a few lackeys. So I feel like dynamic combat both in terms of monster variety and environment variety and very roleplay flavored combats will have to be my focus (unless the group just downright wants to monster mash each session- so far the group is swept up in the current events more than the monster mashing and I'd hate for a larger group to detract from this)
If multiculturalism is considered to be part of our culture (In my eyes it  is ) than respecting other cultures is part of our culture. Depicting Muhammed is not  necessary , choosing not to out of respect was a good idea.
You should differentiate between two types of cheaters. Those who do it for fun and those who try to actually hurt someone or climb the ladder with illegal methods while being undetected.. For example if there are cheaters or multiaccs in top1000 or some other noticable range. Also ban the fucking spincheaters in easy maps :<   Thanks for reading that mess of a text.

Lucian got buffed directly and indirectly with the introduction of a stronger essence reaver and since he hyper scales with cdr now, it's a decent, if not recommended rush.     His e is now comparable to an Ahri mini-ult, as it can be used at least twice in very rapid successions with 20% cdr, achievable with essence reaver and ghost blade.     Very strong vs certain match ups, and only weak against a caitlyn regardless of the support she has.     Rito did a great job on making his strengths more apparent and giving him a weakness that can hurt him, making his pick a little more situational, albeit very slightly.     Insanely fun to play as and is not a pain to play against, but to be honest he never was.       I'd also like to point that his win rate, while not an indicator of champion strength is still pretty decent at telling you which champs are good in soloQ, rose from roughly 49% to 53% on EUW, with a sample size of roughly 33,000 games on the EUW server across all elos.

like most MAL ratings, people didn't get a plot filled drama story or a sol cute girl animals, but instead got cute girls doing cute ship things... Which is what Kantai Collection pretty much is...   Also production values for this show was pretty weak, just be happy it wasn't like Blazblue or Danganropa which was literally flooded with money, but like ship construction in Kancolle if I put in 450 300 350 400 all I get is a fucking Yuudachi, it is good... but for what was put into it, it was a fucking flop.   --   Their response? Something upon the lines of...   The fact that you references Isuca a generic 4th harem anime means you concede defeat.

Socialism is the distribution of goods/services in which the goods/services are funded by a tax-based     Communism can refer to Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism, and more.     Marxism is a system in which countries and government do not exist. People are localized and travel/trade is minimal.     Leninism is a system of transference from capitalism to Marxism. The state, controlled by an oligarchy, is used as a tool to this end.     Stalinism is an extreme flavor of Leninism that more resembles fascism.

You're right, in a way, but it's much more complicated than that, and often outside of the realm of conscious control.  This is why when addicts quit, they often require a behavioural therapy component to their detox/rehab efforts- a conscious effort to control what is an unconscious response is extremely difficult and takes time to learn and develop.  Genetic predisposition for addiction also has an extremely large influence, but I don't know too much about the mechanics of that- yet.  Bug me in about a year or so if you're interested.

Almost all sentences now are plea bargains with more innocent people just having to accept the 'deal' because they can't afford court costs, a decent lawyer or give up months of their lives to an intense jury trial. The system has evolved from innocent until proven guilty to guilty until proven innocent and it is truly shameful.

My flight back from Seattle to New Jersey was cancelled because of Irene, so United told me that they'd pay for my hotel until they could fly me back. They later refused to do so. Had to miss almost a week of work and pay for an additional week in a hotel.   So, Reddit: is there anything I can do in this situation? At the very least I want to do something to report the representative who lied to me on the phone about giving me hotel vouchers, but I unfortunately didn't get her name because I didn't think there would be any issue. It only occurred to me much later that I should have gotten the names of both of the representatives with whom I spoke in person as well.   I've never been in a situation like this before, so I don't know how airlines should handle it. At the very least, it was simply an issue of poor customer service (the misinformation on the phone, and the rudeness of the reps in person), so I'm not really sure what I can do about it, if anything.   Obviously I'm biased and feel that I've been wronged, but I honestly don't know if there's legitimately anything Continental/United should do to compensate me, or if they did the right thing. Any advice is very much appreciated.

Champs without mana simply have no legitimate reason to not have a limiting ressource.   Im not against an additional ressource, they add some more trickyness into the game.. but at it's current state, it's not fair imo. Maybe 2 Ressources would solve that..? :P   edit: well yeah, health cost and energy are also an okay ressource. not as limiting as mana though.   By the way, here's another source that proves that for example Riven simply has no disatvantage towards Talon, and therefore has no reason to not be limited by at least some ressource.   [

Friend is extremely good looking guy. His looks intimidate most girls, and he interprets this as them not liking him. He is depressed and doesn't understand why this keeps happening. It caused him mental pain and suffering for years, but he's over it now and has become very good at making random girls out in public give nervous smiles or a small giggle. He's been dating someone for more than 2 years now, so I think things really have turned around for him.

Air in venous IV line not a big deal, air in arterial line very big deal.   Edit: I should clarify that a "fair amount of air" is roughly 100 mL. I've always been taught it's the air in a standard size drip tubing. So if you forget to flush your line and run fluids into a venous line then you will likely have issues.

SETTING: An attempt at a medieval fantasy setting story, the above is a very general set up that could be expanded in many different ways. I think the set up feels a bit more serious in tone but it doesn't have to be! It could be more adventurous, humorous or have a romantic type of story or completely and fully lewd with plenty of smut along the way. Perhaps our characters get more involved in the religious side of things or they would rather not associate themselves with such kind, or maybe the mother is a priestess in the cult.   Again, the story above is flexible and could be molded into different things, if you have an idea that could improve it in your eyes let me know we can most likely incorporate it!   ROLES: Mother/Son (because Mothers Day :D)   KINKS included but not limited to: oral, vaginal, anal, romance, flirting/teasing, abuse, humiliation, con/non-con/faux-rape, breaking, excessive bodily fluids, lactation, watersports, cumplay, breeding, edging and many others.   SOME of the celebs that could be used for reference include but are not limited to: Olivia Munn, Salma Hayek, Sofia Vergara, Halle Berry, Monica Bellucci, Eva Mendez, Lisa Ann, Ana Cheri, Paula Patton, Angie Varona, Emily Ratajkowski, Heidi Klum, Adriana Lima, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Kelly Brook, Stephanie Seymour, Michelle Lewin.   Preferred playing platform: Instant messaging (i.e. chatzy, google hangouts, YiM, etc.)   Discussion about specific details is welcome and encouraged!  Looking forward to your lovely orange envelopes :)

magic bones infused with the power of a god of darkness spread throughout the world causing problems , beng hunted by Dark paladins who wish to restore their god to his former Power.   PC's will find one of these (probably at the same time as a dark paladin) and then we will see what happens.   So I'd love any and all feedback. If you have any cool ideas please let me know :)   Edit - Hey again. I'm getting some upvotes but no feedback :) as much as I appreciate the upvotes I'd much rather get some feedback in comments. Thanks :)
yes you can* put your skin back. It takes dedication and time. Disclaimer: you won't get perfect results.
Evolution is a causal theory. Creation is a causal theory. Both are mutually exclusive, unlike the idea of God overriding his natural law. Finally, the first chapter of Genesis is important because it is the bedrock of our faith, and we are called to defend that faith, and not compromise it when others stand against it.   Anyway, I hope you at least read the whole thing, I spent about an hour writing it all up.  EDIT: Please pardon my formatting, I can't seem to get the verses to stand out, or the paragraphs to seperate.

The gameplay is super solid and if you're looking for closure from the last two games, definitely get it. Though you may not like the closure they provide. If you aren't, I'd suggest you stay away :(   edit: rearranged a paragraph for better flow
Friend did not want to admit the clearly demonstrated obvious fact because it pissed him off that someone was better than him.   I think the most interesting parts of the arguments would be the illogical "examples" he would use that are twisted to make his point clear, but don't exactly make sense. He would get pissed when I point out that it makes no sense, and offer a more realistic example that either doesn't support him, or actually supports me. I would then be told I'm being 'condescending'.

The major things I have a problem with are: lack of confidence and motivation, content with a very sedentary lifestyle, no plans for school or career, very different interests, and no willpower to change. We dated in high school, she has self-esteem issues, and she cut herself before we got back together. I cheated when I found out and felt trapped at the time. She's since been to therapy. Life together has been easy because we haven't done anything at all. We never go out with friends. We have sex maybe twice a week, and I still find her attractive, but not as much as I used to. I find confidence and intelligence attractive and she's been letting her brain rot not studying or doing anything. I worry though that that's just the way it is because we hear about these relationship problems all the time. Is it worth it to try to pull through? How long is too long to wait? I do love her, but the spark is almost gone. I don't get excited to see her anymore and that bothers me.

took acid, took a shower, saw the grim reaper, people fucking, hands, and a weird glowy cube cult. On a side note, I've told some people on the internet this before and they adamantly believed what I took was not acid on the grounds that I was "seeing things" or "hallucinating" seeing as acid does not make you hallucinate so much as it alters things you already see. It most definitely was acid, and those people are just silly and don't understand what I'm saying. Thanks for reading!

Had gun pulled on us in parking lot, was very polite and ran.

we're all potential criminals, and having a gun readily available makes it easier to make the decision to use a firearm once one has made the decision to engage in criminal behaviour.

My girlfriend hasn't had her period in two months. She isn't pregnant. The doctor keeps saying it's constipation. We're starting to think it's more serious. She is 5'4, roughly 130-145 lbs. She's 19, almost 20. Help?

as much as your social anxiety persists in situations, remember the opportunities we do not take will not unfold. They stay the flower bud they are and will never develop into the blossoming flower than it could be. Don't worry about any repercussions, because quite frankly there aren't any, and just be yourself.   Additional Addendum: I have anxiety when it comes situations, meaning my mind starts to form "what-if" scenarios and in the end I lose what I want and love; So if you need some help coping with some anxiety worries, I'm willing to help.   EDIT: ignore bolded stuff, I honestly have no idea why its bolded.

I mistakenly kept my mouth shut at my brother's first wedding which resulted in a wrecked marriage, drug addiction, and child neglect.  Did not intend to repeat this, and stayed away from his second marriage to another addict-in-recovery when they would not agree to avoid having kids.
pH is low because Nitrates are high. Do water changes or abandon ship.   Edit: I just re-read everything to make sure I was making sense, and did you say that the pH was low at 7-7.5? Because that's neutral-high, and really just the parrotfish are going to like a high pH anyway. Convict cichlids are from central america and prefer a lower pH like the south american cichlids, and as far as I know danios like it neutral. Aiming for 7 is your best bet, maybe 7.5 for the parrots, but if you are aiming for 8 that's high for pretty much everything except african (malawi) cichlids, which are usually much more aggressive. When you mentioned that you were altering the pH, I figured it must be extremely low, because most fish will acclimate to a neutral pH; alterations beyond that are usually for sensitive fish like discus or breeding. You want to change pH gradually, very slowly, in either direction because that's not a change fish can handle rapidly, and also if it's a 75 gallon tank with only two fish in it a 20% water change every other month is not unreasonable, especially if you put a few plants in there, as long as the nitrates aren't super high at the start of this venture. An additional bit of information that may be useful is that water hardness can affect how difficult it is to change the pH, so if I'm way off the mark with the nitrates look into your kH and gH readings.

Non white people are less likely to have ID to begin with and obtaining one is time consuming and expensive. Voter ID laws in turn have more effect on minorities than white people. Additionally, voter ID laws address a nonexistent problem.
COMPARING is where I think the juice comes from, so as long as you incorporate that and use your imagination, you'll be fine.
treat the affected areas you want to roll out as an unironed linen of sort and the pressure should wave across, the more ir hurts the harder you need to press, just like the more stubborn the wrinkle the more pressure you need apply to smooth it out, long slow rolls and pressing against large muscle groups, back, legs arms. Also you can use a lacrosse ball to get into the small little nooks the roller won't reach.

Vyvanse makes me stop what I need to be doing so I can go talk to everyone and also makes me do a million things at once. Is this due to my dose being too high? Or is it possible I was misdiagnosed? I've heard that if the stimulant makes you high all the time, then you don't have ADHD. If it's just the dose that needs to be changed, then how would I know when the medicine is working properly?   Thanks for listening.

Essentially, my biggest questions are:   1) Would it be correct to use 3 arduino-type controllers for my idea of two controllers and a receiver?   2) Should I be using RF or bluetooth to implement this, especially given the fact that there’s other wireless devices (headphones and a guitar) that are going to be in use?   I’m really shooting for being able to accomplish this by July 4 since that’s our first show, so any help I’d greatly appreciate. Thanks in advance!

Girlfriend of 3.5 years, met in 5th grade, started dating in high school and continued through a majority of college. Girlfriend finds another job and she is now "too busy for me to come see her". We break up but despite everything i still feel like i want her back. Is this "love" or is it eventually going to be just a happy memory?   Edit: I forgot to mention that her best friend told me that she had been hanging around with her new work buddies a lot lately. Going out to get drinks, watching movies, and eventually taking a liking to one of her coworkers. This was my breaking point and one of the reasons why i found the separation a lot easier to handle. I asked her on the day we broke up if there was someone else and she promptly told me no. But then i hear that she has been hanging around with this new guy a lot and that she has been to his apartment a few times. I don't know what she's doing now and i don't really want to find out. Her best friend told me about the new guy as a "favor" to me because she felt bad about the whole situation and that she believed that i had no fault in this and that Ellie was doing something that even she found to be very shocking. So i'm at a loss for words.
