God is everywhere. Churches and congregations are sects and cults that primarily accomplish separating themselves from the rest of God's creation because they somehow believe God imparted some special knowledge or information to them and few-none outside of it.   It's even more humorous to me that all these churches worship on Sunday and they're all like "dur dur it doesn't matter but you need a church if you REALLY care about being a Christian".   sigh  If God can make himself known to someone deaf and blind, He most certainly does not need some stone building defacing the beauty of His creation to get His message across.

Went to a gig, got drunk before and during it, decided to go to a club afterwards, get hammered, start talking to a girl who seems slightly chubby, take her home and eat her out, can't get dick hard because of alcohol, wake up and do the same again and fall back asleep, wake up and realise I've licked a hambeasts pussy and have to walk with her to the train station and panic and make the most awkward smalltalk ever.

the fabric of space/time is flexible and adjusts accordingly (but imperfectly) to the changes made by time-traveling, most likely because the story is focused on the emotional stakes more than anything and demanded it, but it still doesn't throw all logic out the window to do so   Ya feel me? .

guy is known for leading countless people on. Intensely flirted with me for around 8 months, people made comments all the time. I was very obvious that I liked him. I eventually came out to him, and he said it was all a joke. Made me vouch for a girl immediately afterwards, telling her how much he loves her. She thought it was random and weird, didn't reciprocate. Blamed all of his life problems on me. Ended up leading another girl on. What is his issue????

me ranting.   EDIT   LOL, I keep editing this to add more.  Finally, if they take away all anonymity online I will simply stop posting.  Part of me wants to say, "that would never happen."  But then, who thought it would ever happen that we can't take photos of police officers, or go to a peaceful demonstration without being pepper sprayed?  I honestly think that if and when total anonymity is lost, so that even on 4chan they require your name and birth date, that there will be a huge exodus into the the hidden web via TOR to a Reddit-like site underground.  There probably are versions of Reddit in the hidden web at the moment but I have no need of them per Reddit is for the most part anonymous already.   EDIT   Obviously I could go on and on about this for here is yet another edit.   My wife uses Facebook religiously.  She is on it every night.  I don't care. In fact it's kinds of nice per she tells me all that's going on in the lives of my friends.  But she also doesn't understand my hesitation to use Facebook.  Maybe she thinks I'm a ludite. But the difference between her and I is that her job does not put her in the public eye as mine does.  She does not have to spend a morning answering e-mails from the 'hurt' and 'offended' when she expresses an opinion.  Her opinion is not that of a public official or deacon or what have you.

I really feel like a miserable failed loser.

Most people in this thread don't understand what it is they're asking you to do.  That fucking sucks and I'm sorry for the hurt and anger that it causes you.  If you've tried treatment and didn't stick with it for more than a year and/or switched doctors you're not giving medical intervention a real shot.  More than anything, I'm sorry your coming out wasn't the joyous occasion it should have been.  Your family sucks, I hope they figure that out and change their minds.

when the boys all have a head start then   they expect everyone to know what they know or they must be stupid and this can be intimidating   for girls who are already arriving late to the proffession and discourage them from doing it.   We also talked about the woman teachers. There are two of them. The girls in the group agreed   they were good teachers and especially one of them was very encouraging and maybe the only   reason they are still in the department. I've only had the other female teacher and while she   can a bad judge of the class's understanding of the material, the students tend not to even   bother asking her to slow down.  The boys critisize both very harshly and it seems out of place   in mine and the other girl's experiences.   Your point 6 ->   The guy who is the faculty supervisor of the AWC said something about this before the focus   group. I'm paraphrasing, "My goal here is not to make Stem 50% woman. If it can't be 50% woman   because more women are legitimately uninterested in these fields then that is fine. My goal   here is to make sure that is the only reason that their wouldn't be 50% woman in this feild."   Everyone in the room agreed with him.   >yet I have never heard of a movement to get more men into nursing. Once again, pushing women   into CS seems completely arbitrary.   Well while I think the stigmatization of male nurses is wrong, there is a difference in the   fields. STEM is more about inventiveness and from different mids comes different ideas. It may   not all be about that but it can play a huge part. However I think we should encourage male   nurses.

After defending WoC at launch and now having seen the beastmen. WoC feels like it was made purely to have something to chuck in with pre-orders rather than an actual DLC. Horde mechanic feels recycled and not tailored to create an experience like you're the bringer of the apocalypse. Gods completely stripped out of game which is incredibly lore unfriendly and ruins gameplay so no benefits. Roster misses big hitters that could've made for cool campaigns and battles. CA could've made an actual story driven campaign but instead made a clunky campaign where you rely on lightning strike.

Gov. helps subsidize whites move out to the suburbs; loan sharks lure blacks into the crumbling cities and suck 'em dry, fuck their schools, and leave them to the slum lords.   Drug Laws   I don't need to go into detail, colored people know the real facts. 70%+ of the prison population is colored. Whites get treated more favorably at every stage of the judicial process. Blacks are guaranteed to get fucked by the police and courts.

Civ 5 is an alright game, but it's a stripped down version compared to the older games. 5 focuses HEAVILY on warfare, leaving you very little else to do. If you just want a turn based wargame, Civ 5 is your game. If you want a real civ game that balances war with many other aspects of statecraft, you'll want 4.
I agree.

I am wondering whether or not to ask out a girl despite never speaking or interacting with her before.   Update:  I talked to her some on the way out of class. Mostly small talk, and at first she seemed kind of weirded out that I was talking to her but eventually she was pretty cool with it and we had a nice conversation. I definitely didn't ask her out straight away but maybe sometime soon I'll probably ask her if she wants to study once finals start approaching. Thanks so much for the encouragement guys! Hope this all works out, if it does then that's great, but if it doesn't, then no big deal and I'm perfectly cool with that.

Manipulated by Best Buy into a hole of $2,000 in debt and don't know where to turn.   EDIT 1 - 12:40pm, 1/25/15:  I realize that I made a foolish mistake and am not saying that my ignorance of what was going on was dismissible but I still stand by my conviction that what was done was cruel on Best Buy's part.   I'm flooded with work/papers for school but I plan to contact Best Buy tomorrow and hopefully sort this out over the phone and will keep you updated. Unfortunately the 30-day return policy has passed for most items, but all items that  are  returnable at this point I plan to return. Thanks again for all the advice so far.   Edit 2 - 1:00am 1/26/15  I get it. What I did what stupid. You don't have to keep reminding me. I'm just an idiot kid who thought he was being careful but wasn't careful enough and now I'm trying to get out of this mess. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing and I'm practically banking on the knowledge of generous strangers to fix this. I'm sorry if I came off as an obnoxious and stupid kid but all I'm asking for is help. I'll try to update you all tomorrow but I have a paper to write for now and won't be getting much sleep.   Also, I don't know why people don't fucking believe me. Why the hell would I lie about this? I'll try to get a family member to send pictures of the dated receipt along with the card and the card statement from my home sometime tomorrow.   EDIT 3 - 11:00[m 1/17/25  [The relating pics that people were asking for]( Sorry it took longer than I said it would. Huge snowstorm where I am now and power is going on/off as well as the internet of course.   From the current advice I've received I plan to:   *Return everything that I can at this point and if items are past their return date I'll ask anyway.   *Call BestBuy and try to explain this misunderstanding in hopes of bettering my current state of affairs.   *Email a bestbuy associate who contacted me through this post   I'll update on what happens. I'll probably get the calls and whatnot done this weekend. I have to keep my grades up and I have 2 tests this week.
Dogs are caged in large numbers, side by side and the process of turning them into food is detailed. Such as being put into bags and thrown into boiling water, or skinned alive.

I am lonely and there seems to be no escape.
What are some things I can do to make friends with people, and can anyone shed some light on maybe why no one ever seems to want to do anything with me, I've had times where people I know are lamenting the fact that they don't have enough people coming to a party while I just sit there right in front of them uninvited?

I'd like to pick up learning to play the guitar as a casual hobby. I'm willing to put in the hard work and effort that is required to develop any sort of real skill. I just need some good beginner's resources to get me started. I'm determined to get good at this, and I promise I'll prove it, no matter how long it takes.   I have an acoustic guitar, a pick, a digital tuner, and a whole lotta spare time.

because apparently you'd prefer to ignore someone rather than reading a few short paragraphs. Then you accuse me of being a sockpuppet.

If you discharge a weapon at someone, regardless of how much training you've had, there is a pretty good chance you're going to kill them. The idea of shoot to injure is a naive one on a good day, and dangerous to anyone who knows anything about it.

If you think that Game of Thrones has "unnecessary sex scenes," you either don't watch the show or haven't paid attention.  This isn't even about whether the sex scenes were necessary or not really, it's about whether there were any at all.  There were maybe 1-2 minutes of sex among 520 minutes, or about 0.3% of the time.
Wife of 2 months reveals she gave $500 to her family to cover rent of a nice 2 bedroom flat for her family. Only one sister has been living there recently. Brother is away at college and other family are out of country for forseeable future. She didn't tell me because she didn't want to "stress me out". She apologised (thought not 100% owned it) on phone, but not sure how to move forward. Big conversation show down coming up this evening. Want to come out of it with best possible outcome   Extra info: I'm pretty well-adjusted and mature when dealing with things and honestly, if she told me, it would not have stressed me out, phased me or push me over the edge. Also, before we got married and bought our house, I lived with my brother and sister in what we’ll call Lake House, which was a 4 bedroom house. Back in Nov/Dec, my family offered her family the chance to use one of the rooms for next to nothing. They refused, basically because of pride. FML.   Edit: OK. Sooo much lost in translation. I don't need to argue with a bunch of Internet strangers, especially on a throwaway account, but I will just leave this... Yes, we aim to practice a more conservative type of Christianity which says two become one so there's no her and my finances...it's ours! When she makes decisions on our money without consulting me, captain or not, that's not nice or in-keeping with us being one. Money coming from her account or mine are technicalities. I went part time at work as a joint decision! All these inferences based off of the captain thing are so wild and off the mark. I obviously know the truth, which is a lot more nuanced than you can get in a post so I'll take the fair comments on the chin but 80% of you reactionary idiots can move on!

PSA:  Doing anything in a car increases your chances of getting caught, especially the chances of your precious grinder being taken away   By Hand Pros     You can control how big to make the pieces. I have a bubbler that has a downstem with a relatively diameter. Even if i use a grinder for it, I have to take one nug by hand a craft what is known as a "nug-plug" to cover this hole, or else my ground weed will fall down into the abyss, never succeeding to get me high.     I find some novelty in it. It brings me back to my high school days.  I'm sure some of you can relate.     No need to be carrying around extra weight/using storage space when moving around       By Hand Cons     As mentioned before, some think it wastes weed, others disagree. It all about what you think. I don't know what to think about this issue, but I personally like having a kief collection.      Okay, I'm gonna keep the "By Hand" pros and cons short because I'd just be re-hashing information mentioned in my grinder analysis.

They don't need to hear that they're horrible for not considering their kids "a miracle/gift from god".

If you have the extra 35 bucks, a Hyper 212 EVO or other entry-level aftermarket cooler (GEMIN II for low-profile, etc.) is a great addition to a build, regardless of overclocking desires.  In fact, a Hyper 212 isn't really adequate for anything but marginal overclocking (say, 10% by nudging the multiplier and not touching VCore).  What it does do is ensure better heat dissipation under load to guarantee your CPU stays well within recommended temperature ranges.

She says that she was shocked that I asked her, didn't know how to let me down. We go our separate ways.

The main difference is, on medication, if a stray thought drifts by that isn't relevant to what I'm doing, it just dies immediately unless I try consciously to pursue it, and then it's a bit harder to force it to blossom. Off medication, a single stray thought can blossom unbidden into a giant network of thoughts that takes my entire mind away from what I'm supposed to be doing...and there are  more  stray thoughts. Everything I describe here is just an extension of this underlying process.   (This is written on medication. See almost any post before 2 days ago to see what I write like off medication. Not sure if there a difference.)

There's no history of discrimination or oppression in sexually objectifying male athletes which is why this is seen as so much less "wrong". Also, men are more physically capable and therefore dangerous than tiny white girls, which would further justify more force being applied.

In theory, the large handful of JRPG's & random well-budgeted dubs would allow for better reference between Japanese & US VO  (which is generally regarded as better than Canadian), as most big projects over there are Japan Actors'union-approved,  but even anime dubs are solo ADR, as most JP animation, including dubs, is recorded in group ADR, whereas there is basically none of that here   (Tbf the idea of group-recorded dubs sounds extremely inefficient to me, & this further clouds my judgement on the acting.

The point in my last relationship came when I had started to become angry and annoyed with my ex, rather than feeling happy and content.  Caring for someone with depression and anxiety requires a lot of patience and care. I wasn't strong enough to care for my ex.

So to conclude, "If I were to take a DNA swab of a transgender woman, what sex would the DNA results tell me she was? " It wouldn't. It tells you absolutely nothing. Edit: Phenotype is what is used in the determination of sex in human beings, and that includes everything from genitalia to endocrine system -- and even neurology. We're all real.   Here is more information for those that like to learn:   Genitalia is not the single factor used to determine sex either:   Total number of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female one in 100 births   There are all sorts of variations in humanity. We're all real.

The filter+potential metaphor shouldn't be construed as one-way, because it's a metaphor describing the current state of the larger "you". The environment you encounter then  is  the larger you, and to explore it is to explore the larger mind, so one should always be listening.

It looks like DFW would be a great place for us to settle down, but we're also heavily looking at Austin, due to a lot of comments and some additional research we did last night.

A college is shutting off a dorm's internet connection as a mass punishment. My fiance is working on graduate school applications online, and cannot apply since there no other place on campus to get internet access.   So, I have several questions:     What can she tell the dean to make him change his mind?   Does she have any legal rights? How can she fight this? ACLU?   Is there a potential way around the internet block? We've thought about 3G modems, but they're rather expensive.     Also, please- no "Shut up about having a fiance fiance" or "forever alone" posts. This is a serious question, and may have serious ramifications to someone's life.

You really think someone would do that, just go on the internet and tell lies?   Edit: I should add that these are two of the well known cases. They were by no means the only people making up family histories.

it is entitlement, stop trying to say it's not. Not wanting to pay and still expecting the product is exactly that.   You haven't shown that whenever people pirate they feel entitled.

Don't have that conversation with your parents. You can't win, you're not going to make any headway. Not with rational arguments. Not with good arguments. If there was a way to reason someone out of beliefs that they didn't reason themselves into we would be the first to tell you exactly how to do it. And since you're their kid (and probably still dependent on them) they'll walk all over you in a conversation or an argument. You're gonna have to fight the good fight until you get out on your own, unfortunately.   So keep it simple. "I only care about things that are falsifiable (have the potential to be proven false) and your religion isn't, so I don't care about it."   Everything in science is falsifiable. That's one of the reasons why it's science. They are no unsinkable rubber duckies.

I've gotten the impression that aspies are stereotypically egotistical and selfish, which is how my roommates seemed to think of me, but I think this comes from assertiveness and maybe a little audacity. Being a logical thinker means looking for definitive answers and trying to be right. Society seems to propose a false dichotomy between thinking logically and being caring and nurturing, but autistics aren't sociopaths. What are some of the (hopefully healthy) ways in which you do or do not care for those around you?

My boyfriend keeps turning down my sexual advances and I'm not sure how to approach the situation

My ex wants to hang out alone and get drunk. I think it is disrespectful to the people we are seeing now even though we have not gotten serious. She says it is not weird since we do not have feelings for each other anymore.   Edit : What should I say to her to let her know how I feel?

Told her I still love her and feelings ensued for the sole purpose of sex.  When I am done with her I will tell her my true feelings.  She is worthless and will amount to no more than a trophy wife.  Also I am patient.

Legion's change could be explained with clues from the story (Reaper code making him think more like an organic could push him towards wanting to keep and share it with his race, just off the top of my head), but it fits the theme of that story better.

I have started a group of subreddits to help organize redditors into country, state and congressional districts to help us focus on our local changes that need to happen as well as changes needed for the state and national level.   Also I am looking for those who are talented in CSS and experienced in moderating subreddits.  I want these subreddits to run like a well oiled machine.  Anyone who can help will be greatly appreciated.  We have seen our world change a lot in our lifetime.  It hasn't always been for the best.  I think it is time we as citizens of the world unite and not let anyone say that they didn't have a chance to hear our voice.   If you read this post and agree that things need to be done please join [WorldUnity]( and then join the subreddit for your country, state and district.  Any country outside of the US does not have a subreddit yet.  For those who live outside of the US please create a subreddit for your country and let me know about it and I will link it to the rest of the subs.   When you join your local state and district subreddits start researching information in your area and start posting.  This might start off slow but I think we have something good here.

I put tons of effort into being the ideal boyfriend and trying to make my would-be girlfriend happy but she had feelings for her ex still so she broke up with me and now I feel like there's no point in relationships. Is this normal? How do I change my attitude if it isn't? How do I get past the fact that I will now compare any future SO's to this girl and how she was?
Is doing extra-nice things for your girlfriend actually accepted like it is in the movies or would that be considered clingy?

So, realize that right now there is plenty of good reason for her not to like sex or want to try to have it. You need to talk with your girl right now, be supportive, and get over yourselves and SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP (and make absolutely sure that the help you seek is well experienced in dealing with vaginismus). I just wish that I could go back in time and give myself this advice earlier, and save years of frustration. "   Update: Since I wrote that a year ago, things have progressed pretty nicely. Both of us have relaxed more and more and things have just kept getting better and better.

Play SWTOR for great single player and mediocre PvP.  WoW is outdated - hopefully Blizzard will do better with Titan.   Bonus:  -  try Tera!   Graphics blow away both SWTOR and WoW.  Performance is phenomenal in comparison.  PvP combat is absolutely stellar.  Guild vs Guild combat is awesome and fulfilling.  Tera is much more polished (in Beta) than SWTOR is (even with 1.2).  God of War style combat where dodging and targeting actually matter.   Tera > SWTOR > WoW   I'll try GW2 this weekend and add that into the mix another time ;)   Hope this helps.

Government/corporate run clinics are setup to be shitty but treat a group that generally has no access to care.  In order to stay afloat due to much worse reimbursement than private practice, production is a much bigger concern and thus, you are pressured to do things you object to morally.

Bought fake paintings for way to much by people posing as art students but really selling Chinese knock offs.   Update #1  Today the "framer" rolled by. Actually, let me be more accurate. I knew he was coming, but I was out running errands so I let him call and leave messages knowing he was waiting for me at the house. I drove by him sitting there, and he was probably pretty pissed. Oh well though. He came back by an hour later and rang the doorbell/knocked on the door. To which I opened the door and let him know that I didn't need his services. I also explained it was a scam and that his friends can come and pick up the paintings. He said he didn't know how to get in touch with them. So, I guess we'll see what happens. They have a canceled check, and I have two paintings sitting in a closet somewhere. He did say he was local and they provide him with a lot of business. Guess I will wait and see if they call.   Update #2  Pretty much the last update. Guess they were getting ready to party in Reno, when the discovered the check bounced (I canceled the check). They called me from a blocked number, and I guess someone is going to come get the paintings. So. Seems like this is all done with. She said, she was sorry that I felt that way and that they are aware that there are "other fakes out there" and all they can do is hope that I "can trust them". Yeah, nope. I wasn't buying it. Being a dick is easier when you have had a shitty week too.   Pretty much the end. Lesson learned.

It's unfortunate but it seems like bitching loud enough won't really matter to Sony. I wrote this post mainly to allow conversation to happen rather than the knee jerk unpleasantness that's being happening lately, but I also sided with the opinion that we should complain. Bastrion illustrates how even if we were all vocally complaining on this sub, it almost certainly wouldn't matter, unfortunately.   Edit2: Next month's line up definitely did not help the situation.

Visual thinking, to the point of being akin to a movie. Has some "ticks".   So what does reddit think?
Your friend is an ass, get new friend
lady says her table is messy, I'm in the middle of something so go tell manager to get it cleaned. 20 minutes later I walk out, clocked off in casual clothes and this same lady comes and abuses me for her table being messy. I ignore her and walk away. She grabs my arm and I tell her to fuck off. Next day manager is totally cool with the whole situation.
I am leaving for the money and the experience, but I'll come back for the lifestyle.
seriously, its not worth the risk.
RVP and Song were not just one season wonders and replacing them is a much greater task than some people think, We can't keep relying on one or two people to stand a chance of  just  making the champions league and our lack of trophies is contributing a lot to the player exodus, and Kroenke's lack of football knowledge means the fans have to pick up his slack in terms of feedback.

I guess I don't know what I hope to achieve by writing this. I'm a big chicken and don't want to go through with it, but I think I have to. I've felt like this for a long time and even though the relationship has improved, this feeling hasn't gone away. I can't ignore it anymore, even though it really feels like I'm ripping out my heart. We've been together for almost 10 years -- he's a part of me and a good man. Does anyone have any experiences or advice?  Thank you for reading.

girlfriend, 5 years, take a break and live separately, oh noes.   Has anyone else taken a break, and had it turn out ok?  I feel like a break is basically a death sentence for a relationship.   If she's getting with other people, do you think I should too, even if I'm the one who doesn't even want a break?   any advice helps   ok, so we talked today:  UPDATE : and she realizes that she may have jumped to the conclusion that time apart will fix some of our problems, which is one reason she wanted to break.  I don't think it's a bad idea to live separately after we do some counseling, as it would benefit us both with being more independent, but now is the time to work on the relationship.   thanks again for the advice, and I'm still listening.
I have a profitable business, but looking to grow it out of my current network and having trouble.

this quest chain sucks, it's too long, it's counterproductive, and I want the weekly bounties already.   edit: not surprised at the sheer number of downvotes in trying to spur an actual discussion. Sad.   People need to realize despite all the "I I I, me me me" I typed into this post, Crucible is not just comprised of myself. I am not complaining for myself. There's a lot of people who do Crucible full time and are probably excited to have a shot at high end stuff every week again but are locked behind a menial, pointless, boring timesink of a wall that has only a carrot on a stick at the end and nothing in-between, while PvE content has players being rewarded at every turn with new content, better rewards, gear upgrades, etc.

I feel that with some words I say, it sounds like I run out of breathe. I don't know if you notice it or not and i'm just being paranoid about it. Check from 8.10 and pay attention to "Honey, why did you shit out a little turd" line, specifically turd.
What more can I do to ensure I am the pack leader in my house.   EDIT  Thank you all for your responses. It has given me lots to research to do. I know I am not doing the wrong thing when raising my little guy. It is also good to know all his behaviors are "normal" and he isn't seeming to be an unruly dog. Also good to know that the dominance theory is old school!

Don't worry, as we will be paying the tax rather than collecting it from the customer. Prices will still be the same for you. We are taking one for the team and paying the tax ourselves, as you don't deserve to be giving the government free money for having a better alternative to cigarettes and other tobacco products. :)

I've found myself caught in a fast-paced whirlwind romance, which is something very out of character for me. I am crazy about the guy, but out of touch with the adult dating scene. I guess I'm just asking if this relationship progression sounds normal and lasting or viable.
version. Instead of them screwing me over and literally getting nothing out of it, they used my first video as free advertising.   Before you say any thing about piracy being horrible. I have this game preordered on steam. [Here's some proof.]( I loved Blood Dragon, even using a screenshot as a background. I constantly, time after time, pushed people to buy the game in the videos. Ubisoft took a risk with this expansion instead of playing it safe and just giving us lame FC3 DLC. This is a 7-8 hour long expansion for only $15. Most gaming companies would charge a full $60. Seriously, support Ubisoft with this expansion! Show the gaming market that this can be successful and we'll see more of these releases.   EDIT: Typo in the title. Me not my. My bad.

Feeling super low because in my mostly female workplace I hear many sexist comments from women who consider themselves to be feminists. Wondering whether it has to do with cultural differences between Europe and the US.
version: Months after break up I'm starting to get random messages from random people each stating different things about me that I'd never heard of before. Obviously rumors are afoot and I've lost pretty much all my friends because of them. Is there any way to deal with it head on or is it better to just shake my head and try to tell myself a real friend would have come to me with this looking for clarification before accepting it as gospel and painting me with a red brush? I mean, is it worth fighting and standing up for myself or should I just consider all of this a chapter closed in my life and look to interact and meet with entirely new people and write everyone I knew off?   Thanks for any input. Appreciate it.
How to introduce new classes to HS:     create basic and expert set     create own adventure with cards themed after old, but used expansion (blackrock, TGT)     release new set with the same number of class cards (the new class included)     release craftable only cards for gone sets (naxx, GvG)       What do you think of it?

More direct competition between credit card companies will result in better rates for consumers, not worse.
