Intel and AMD have unveiled new processors. The processors are designed to compete with each other. AMD's processors are more powerful than Intel's.
 AMD vs. Intel: How do they compare? AMD has a new processor, Intel has a different one. AMD's new processor is faster than Intel's.
A look at AMD's newest and Intel's latest processors. The two companies are both based in California. AMD's processors are more powerful than Intel's.
AMD's new chip is a big step up from its previous one. The company is also the first to offer a new chip that can compete with Intel's.
"We're going to be able to compete with Intel," AMD CEO says. AMD and Intel have been battling over the past few years.
The AMD-Intel chip battle is a battle of the chip giants, as AMD's new processors are more powerful than Intel's.
 AMD's new processors are the same as Intel's. AMD's processors are designed to compete with Intel's processors.
 AMD and Intel are both releasing new processors this week. The two companies are competing for the next-generation processor.

An antenna of the right length produces the best results. Different materials conduct electricity differently. The signal travels into the antenna in the form of electrons, travels up the length of it, and is pushed out of the antenna.
The formula we'll use is 468 / (Frequency in Mhz) = total length in feet[approx]. Different materials conduct electricity differently and should therefore be cut to the appropriate length.
When a power source is connected to a transmitter/transceiver, it sends electrons through the wires and into the transmitter or transceiver. Each frequency has a certain wavelength, therefore an antenna of the right length produces the best results.

A good conductive metal should be made out of a good conductivity metal. Different materials conduct electricity differently and should be cut to the appropriate length.
The right length antenna for a given frequency is important for digital signals. Different materials conduct electricity differently so the antenna should be cut to the correct length. The electrons that travel through the antenna push out of it like light.
An antenna of the right length produces the best results. Different materials conduct electricity differently and should be cut to the appropriate length.
The right length antenna for a given frequency is important for digital signals. Different materials conduct electricity differently so the antenna should be cut to the correct length.
