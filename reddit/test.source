Hello. reddit Libertarians   I would like to share with you the company I made for us all.  It will take some work, but it was built with love in mind.   As for the why, its political and complicated and it follows...   Like most of you, I was unnerved at the releases of Edward Snowden.  I was disgusted at the companies, which I used and paid for their services, that were complicit on spying on the people of the world.   As a military veteran, I was sure that my brothers and sisters would not allow this to stand.  We would surely do something to keep our oaths.  As I watched the NSA Clapper lie to congress, the reality of how deep the power went, set in.  Even the oft errant servants of the American people were being kept out of the loop, with a few exceptions.  The tech giants, being a party to the deception, still to this day, spy on us.   What to do?  I thought of many possibilities.  I am familiar with the US economic system, as I was studying for my Masters in economics.  I know that the most powerful way to influence the system was through economic power.   So my solution came to me.  I would form the most powerful corporation in the history of the world.   That is when I created Beyond Linked.  Its founding principle was based on equality.  I hope to give people in this world a platform to unite.  To build a foundation on which the people of the world can stand.   Nothing is perfect, but I could not think of a better solution.  I am taking advice.   www.beyondlinked.com
Alright. Obviously a throwaway account.   First off, I'm no good at stories, so here's the jest of it. I just started seeing this girl the past couple weeks, and she is fucking awesome. We had a great connection since we first started hanging out, and things got more serious as time went on. We've gotten more physical recently, and each time when we try and get intimate, I just can't keep it up. First time I chalked it up to me having too much to drink, and when we tried again, after only 2 beers, i still wasn't able to get anything going. I really don't know what's going on. Masturbation when I'm alone and thinking of her, fine, no problem. When I'm hanging out with her, and things start getting physical, no luck. I just feel like something is wrong with me, and as a result of my problem, she thinks something is wrong with her, when I really believe that there isn't. I have never had this problem before, and while I'm not the most experienced person sexually, I haven't ever had this problem with someone before, especially someone who I am this interested in. Has anyone had to deal with something like this before?
So my story actually starts with a literal butterfly.   About 5 years ago I was walking home from work, when I saw a huge black and yellow butterfly, probably as big as my palm. I was staring at it as it flew down and landed on the grass. Right by where it landed, there was a $50 note.   I decided to treat myself to a night out at dinner with my lucky find, and after I left the restaurant, I ran into an old friend from school. We decided to go out to lunch and catch up.   So talking to her at lunch, it turned out she needed someone to walk her dogs, and I had been going for walks after work anyway, and her house was nearby, so I offered to walk them for her.   One day when I was walking the dog through a park, I started talking to a women and we hit it off and started dating. She ended up moving in with me, but then things didn't work out. She sent a guy around to collect her things, and he felt bad for me and offered to take me out for a drink.   So that night we went out to a bar, and he said he knew someone he could set me up with. I wasn't sure if I was ready to date again so soon, but I figured it might take my mind off it, and it was just dinner, I had nothing to lose.   So I go out to dinner with her, and it goes really really great. We start dating and to skip forward a few years we end up getting married. She's also the one that introduced me to reddit, and thus is the reason I saw this post, and decided to make up this story because I was bored.   So that's my personal story of the butterfly effect.
Peripheral nerves do not actually know where they are located; they are merely structures by which the brain receives input regarding the body's surroundings. The main sensory center is in the [postcentral gyrus]( of the brain. Parts of this structure correspond to various parts of the body, as represented by the [cortical homunculus](   In the normal physiology of the human body (assuming that the nervous system is wired correctly through normal development), sensations such as pain, touch and vibration stimulate peripheral nerves, which transmit impulses through the spine/cranial nerves into the brain. Basically: peripheral nerves > spine > brain.   It is important to note that the only truly critical part of this pathway in order to perceive sensation consciously is the stimulation of the brain itself. This is evident in disease entities which can "fool" the brain, such as  spinal cord syndromes  of the spinal or  peripheral nerves  can result in the perception of sensation in a part of the body when the nerve endings on the skin are not actually receiving any stimulus. Many other phenomena exist to illustrate this, but these are the pathologies that come to mind.
I represent /r/funny in legal matters with /r/KarmaCourt. I just recently served as their Defense attorney in a case where a user tried to sue the  entire sub  for not being funny (usually in KarmaCourt, it's just redditors suing other redditors, for karma whoring and such.) [Here is the trial thread]( if you're bored. It's actually rather interesting.
No, there's a lot of customization you can do without being rooted. For example, you can change your homescreen to a different launcher with different features. Prime examples are Nova Launcher and Themer, which allows you to choose from a huge variety of themes. You can also change your default music player, SMS app, lock screen, or basically anything else. You can also backup and restore SMS and other things you can't on iOS.   With root, it's a completely different story. You can completely change the software that you are on, and some phones can even install or dual-boot with Firefox OS or Ubuntu. With Xposed Modules, you can do a large quantity of unique things that are similar to some more advanced Cydia tweaks like messing with the functionlity of things inside of apps. You can get extra performance by overclocking or you can get extra features by install a custom ROM. You can even install a custom kernel, which will allow you to change the basic I/Os of the Linux base. This allows you to completely tweak even the smallest technical details of your OS and hardware, like individual governors for different cores and use cool things like Quick Charging and Intelligent CPU Boosting.   Most jailbroken tweaks you can find on Cydia, however, are equivalent to things you can do simply with the Play Store. Emulators, Torrent Clients, and apps to download music and video are easy to come across. In fact, you can find almost anything on the Play Store. Custom keyboards have been around for a huge amount of time, and there's a plethora of other things to customized around the OS. And even if it's not on the Play Store, you can simply grab the apk online and install it. You don't have to be rooted to install apps not found on the Play Store. The file system of Android is completely accessible except for the root directory, no more crappy syncing. You can just drop and drag. The best part is that you can make it so they are the default app. For example, all links will open in a certain browser or you can set a specific camera app to be launched from the lockscreen.   But yeah, hope that helped! There's most than just that, but I'd prefer to not be typing all night.
I can't say I've ever had aa, but it seems I can compare it to the time I curiously took ruffinol.  You know, rufies?  I took one to know what the effects were. Two words: sleep paralysis.  It sucked.  I was terrified, unable to move, but completely aware.  It was like having a nightmare that you can't wake up from.  My eyes could move, but more or less of their own volition.  I was at home, decided to couple it with a light cocktail.  About halfway through the drink, I decided to lie down.  I knew I was gonna end up in that position anyway, so I did so before I fell down instead.  After I laid myself down, it took all of about four minutes to cease to be able to move or talk.  I could feel my extremities, the raising and lowering of my chest as I breathed, and the blood in my ears.  There was no pain, as I was not having surgery at the time, at least not in the physical sense.  As for what was going through my mind, more or less disgust.  I simply can't figure out how a person could rape another.  Especially if they were veritably passed out. That's about it from my end.
You seem to miss the  entire  point in conlanging. Whether you are a troll or not, I'm going to try to answer your question in a useful manner, addressing some important points.   1: Why do people conlang?   Ask (almost) any conlanger, and they'll all answer the same;  just for fun . Just as you play with Lego  for fun , and draw MLP fanart  for fun . Conlanging is a hobby, and hobbies are expressions of creativitiy, talent, and spare time.   2: 'Conlanger' is not a profession   Sure;  Frommer, Peterson,  there are exceptions, just as there are hobby painters and professional painters, but in general, conlanging is not a profitable hobby, just as painting isn't. In fact, many'll argue that conlanging is one of the least rewarding art expressions out there. A good conlang takes years, if not decennia to be completed, and all you end up with is a reference grammar that approximately five people will read, and likely, your conlang will end up somewhere on an old page of a forgotten blog on a website that's 'down for maintenance'. But as with most hobbies, the fun is not in completion, it's in the process itself. It's picking odd phonemes, looking at natural languages, create a batshit case system, and discover fourteen levels of evidentiality.  Or you go the other way, by picking five phonemes, no gender, cases, tenses, moods, voices or anything else, and just go full-minlang.   3: Nobody buys a language.   Okay, some people do, but that's the big movie giants we talked about earlier, or maybe a novel writer, or a game-developing company. But most individuals don't even know what a conlang is, let alone seek to be in the possession of one. Therefore, the demand for conlangs is low, too low to form a business.   I hope I answered all your questions adequately, and please correct me if I'm wrong.
I don't want to sit next to anyone, personally.   If I have no choice, I'll pick a girl because I don't think she's going to hurt me (if she does, at least we're both girls and I have a better chance with her than with a stronger guy), she'll understand (hopefully) why I picked a girl seat partner, and it's just something that's drilled into my head from childhood - go to the bathroom with another girl, go for walks with another girl, etc.   It's not that I think guys are creepy or anything, it's just a mental security thing I guess.   I have, however, parked my ass in the center of a group of guys I didn't know, despite the way they hesitated about a strange girl settling amongst them and being dead silent, when I felt threatened by another guy.  He had been looking at me with those eyes that warn you somethings not all there for him, and slowly getting closer despite my uncomfortable body language.  Eventually he started mumbling complaints about me and other people in an alarming way and I figured I was safer with the big dudes who seemed to be having a laugh together in the back corner.   The creeper did end up coming our way snapping at me for something I didn't do, and the guys realized what was wrong and started telling him off until he left, then they asked if I was alright, and went back to socializing with each other.
