Hello. reddit Libertarians   I would like to share with you the company I made for us all.  It will take some work, but it was built with love in mind.   As for the why, its political and complicated and it follows...   Like most of you, I was unnerved at the releases of Edward Snowden.  I was disgusted at the companies, which I used and paid for their services, that were complicit on spying on the people of the world.   As a military veteran, I was sure that my brothers and sisters would not allow this to stand.  We would surely do something to keep our oaths.  As I watched the NSA Clapper lie to congress, the reality of how deep the power went, set in.  Even the oft errant servants of the American people were being kept out of the loop, with a few exceptions.  The tech giants, being a party to the deception, still to this day, spy on us.   What to do?  I thought of many possibilities.  I am familiar with the US economic system, as I was studying for my Masters in economics.  I know that the most powerful way to influence the system was through economic power.   So my solution came to me.  I would form the most powerful corporation in the history of the world.   That is when I created Beyond Linked.  Its founding principle was based on equality.  I hope to give people in this world a platform to unite.  To build a foundation on which the people of the world can stand.   Nothing is perfect, but I could not think of a better solution.  I am taking advice.   www.beyondlinked.com
Alright. Obviously a throwaway account.   First off, I'm no good at stories, so here's the jest of it. I just started seeing this girl the past couple weeks, and she is fucking awesome. We had a great connection since we first started hanging out, and things got more serious as time went on. We've gotten more physical recently, and each time when we try and get intimate, I just can't keep it up. First time I chalked it up to me having too much to drink, and when we tried again, after only 2 beers, i still wasn't able to get anything going. I really don't know what's going on. Masturbation when I'm alone and thinking of her, fine, no problem. When I'm hanging out with her, and things start getting physical, no luck. I just feel like something is wrong with me, and as a result of my problem, she thinks something is wrong with her, when I really believe that there isn't. I have never had this problem before, and while I'm not the most experienced person sexually, I haven't ever had this problem with someone before, especially someone who I am this interested in. Has anyone had to deal with something like this before?
So my story actually starts with a literal butterfly.   About 5 years ago I was walking home from work, when I saw a huge black and yellow butterfly, probably as big as my palm. I was staring at it as it flew down and landed on the grass. Right by where it landed, there was a $50 note.   I decided to treat myself to a night out at dinner with my lucky find, and after I left the restaurant, I ran into an old friend from school. We decided to go out to lunch and catch up.   So talking to her at lunch, it turned out she needed someone to walk her dogs, and I had been going for walks after work anyway, and her house was nearby, so I offered to walk them for her.   One day when I was walking the dog through a park, I started talking to a women and we hit it off and started dating. She ended up moving in with me, but then things didn't work out. She sent a guy around to collect her things, and he felt bad for me and offered to take me out for a drink.   So that night we went out to a bar, and he said he knew someone he could set me up with. I wasn't sure if I was ready to date again so soon, but I figured it might take my mind off it, and it was just dinner, I had nothing to lose.   So I go out to dinner with her, and it goes really really great. We start dating and to skip forward a few years we end up getting married. She's also the one that introduced me to reddit, and thus is the reason I saw this post, and decided to make up this story because I was bored.   So that's my personal story of the butterfly effect.
Peripheral nerves do not actually know where they are located; they are merely structures by which the brain receives input regarding the body's surroundings. The main sensory center is in the [postcentral gyrus]( of the brain. Parts of this structure correspond to various parts of the body, as represented by the [cortical homunculus](   In the normal physiology of the human body (assuming that the nervous system is wired correctly through normal development), sensations such as pain, touch and vibration stimulate peripheral nerves, which transmit impulses through the spine/cranial nerves into the brain. Basically: peripheral nerves > spine > brain.   It is important to note that the only truly critical part of this pathway in order to perceive sensation consciously is the stimulation of the brain itself. This is evident in disease entities which can "fool" the brain, such as  spinal cord syndromes  of the spinal or  peripheral nerves  can result in the perception of sensation in a part of the body when the nerve endings on the skin are not actually receiving any stimulus. Many other phenomena exist to illustrate this, but these are the pathologies that come to mind.
I represent /r/funny in legal matters with /r/KarmaCourt. I just recently served as their Defense attorney in a case where a user tried to sue the  entire sub  for not being funny (usually in KarmaCourt, it's just redditors suing other redditors, for karma whoring and such.) [Here is the trial thread]( if you're bored. It's actually rather interesting.
No, there's a lot of customization you can do without being rooted. For example, you can change your homescreen to a different launcher with different features. Prime examples are Nova Launcher and Themer, which allows you to choose from a huge variety of themes. You can also change your default music player, SMS app, lock screen, or basically anything else. You can also backup and restore SMS and other things you can't on iOS.   With root, it's a completely different story. You can completely change the software that you are on, and some phones can even install or dual-boot with Firefox OS or Ubuntu. With Xposed Modules, you can do a large quantity of unique things that are similar to some more advanced Cydia tweaks like messing with the functionlity of things inside of apps. You can get extra performance by overclocking or you can get extra features by install a custom ROM. You can even install a custom kernel, which will allow you to change the basic I/Os of the Linux base. This allows you to completely tweak even the smallest technical details of your OS and hardware, like individual governors for different cores and use cool things like Quick Charging and Intelligent CPU Boosting.   Most jailbroken tweaks you can find on Cydia, however, are equivalent to things you can do simply with the Play Store. Emulators, Torrent Clients, and apps to download music and video are easy to come across. In fact, you can find almost anything on the Play Store. Custom keyboards have been around for a huge amount of time, and there's a plethora of other things to customized around the OS. And even if it's not on the Play Store, you can simply grab the apk online and install it. You don't have to be rooted to install apps not found on the Play Store. The file system of Android is completely accessible except for the root directory, no more crappy syncing. You can just drop and drag. The best part is that you can make it so they are the default app. For example, all links will open in a certain browser or you can set a specific camera app to be launched from the lockscreen.   But yeah, hope that helped! There's most than just that, but I'd prefer to not be typing all night.
I can't say I've ever had aa, but it seems I can compare it to the time I curiously took ruffinol.  You know, rufies?  I took one to know what the effects were. Two words: sleep paralysis.  It sucked.  I was terrified, unable to move, but completely aware.  It was like having a nightmare that you can't wake up from.  My eyes could move, but more or less of their own volition.  I was at home, decided to couple it with a light cocktail.  About halfway through the drink, I decided to lie down.  I knew I was gonna end up in that position anyway, so I did so before I fell down instead.  After I laid myself down, it took all of about four minutes to cease to be able to move or talk.  I could feel my extremities, the raising and lowering of my chest as I breathed, and the blood in my ears.  There was no pain, as I was not having surgery at the time, at least not in the physical sense.  As for what was going through my mind, more or less disgust.  I simply can't figure out how a person could rape another.  Especially if they were veritably passed out. That's about it from my end.
You seem to miss the  entire  point in conlanging. Whether you are a troll or not, I'm going to try to answer your question in a useful manner, addressing some important points.   1: Why do people conlang?   Ask (almost) any conlanger, and they'll all answer the same;  just for fun . Just as you play with Lego  for fun , and draw MLP fanart  for fun . Conlanging is a hobby, and hobbies are expressions of creativitiy, talent, and spare time.   2: 'Conlanger' is not a profession   Sure;  Frommer, Peterson,  there are exceptions, just as there are hobby painters and professional painters, but in general, conlanging is not a profitable hobby, just as painting isn't. In fact, many'll argue that conlanging is one of the least rewarding art expressions out there. A good conlang takes years, if not decennia to be completed, and all you end up with is a reference grammar that approximately five people will read, and likely, your conlang will end up somewhere on an old page of a forgotten blog on a website that's 'down for maintenance'. But as with most hobbies, the fun is not in completion, it's in the process itself. It's picking odd phonemes, looking at natural languages, create a batshit case system, and discover fourteen levels of evidentiality.  Or you go the other way, by picking five phonemes, no gender, cases, tenses, moods, voices or anything else, and just go full-minlang.   3: Nobody buys a language.   Okay, some people do, but that's the big movie giants we talked about earlier, or maybe a novel writer, or a game-developing company. But most individuals don't even know what a conlang is, let alone seek to be in the possession of one. Therefore, the demand for conlangs is low, too low to form a business.   I hope I answered all your questions adequately, and please correct me if I'm wrong.
I don't want to sit next to anyone, personally.   If I have no choice, I'll pick a girl because I don't think she's going to hurt me (if she does, at least we're both girls and I have a better chance with her than with a stronger guy), she'll understand (hopefully) why I picked a girl seat partner, and it's just something that's drilled into my head from childhood - go to the bathroom with another girl, go for walks with another girl, etc.   It's not that I think guys are creepy or anything, it's just a mental security thing I guess.   I have, however, parked my ass in the center of a group of guys I didn't know, despite the way they hesitated about a strange girl settling amongst them and being dead silent, when I felt threatened by another guy.  He had been looking at me with those eyes that warn you somethings not all there for him, and slowly getting closer despite my uncomfortable body language.  Eventually he started mumbling complaints about me and other people in an alarming way and I figured I was safer with the big dudes who seemed to be having a laugh together in the back corner.   The creeper did end up coming our way snapping at me for something I didn't do, and the guys realized what was wrong and started telling him off until he left, then they asked if I was alright, and went back to socializing with each other.
Article 1, Section 8, Clause 15-16 was in the original Constitution. I don't know if you are american or not, but just for the benefit of the doubt, I assume no here. The Constitution  can not be changed or altered fundamentally, but amended via separate documents. Therefore, what is in the original Constitution articles (as such above), was originally written in there by the authors. Sadly, this means that the founding fathers feared what we the people understood to be our right: that when the very government they instituted became what it is today, the people would use the militias allowed us by our government to overthrow it and institute a new system, whether it be for better or for worse.
Yes.  And  "Star Wars"  was actually a somewhat effective tool of statesmanship/pressure.  And he never advocated for  Apartheid , but realized the US couldn't fight against every injustice in every country all at once, but had to make foreign policy tradeoffs. And  tripling the debt  at that time may have been a reasonable choice if growing GDP/productivity would offset that as an overall percentage and/or it could shorten the Cold War.  And standing up to the  Air Traffic Controllers  union may have been a wise move for the overall economy.  And he probably was never so senile that he actually thought  old movies  were current reality.  These are all points people can legitimately debate and disagree on.   But don't let that stand in the way of Reddit's unquestioning hatred of Reagan.   I mean  I UNDERSTAND THAT HIS PRESIDENCY WAS FLAWED  just like all of them. But he was neither the savior of the universe nor the spawn of the devil.  Just another dude working at a government job (ok, the  top  government job) and doing an above average job of it.  We've had  many  that were worse and a fair number that were better.   (Don't ask me to try to defend the Contras, Sandinistas, guns-for-hostages, etc.  I won't.  I'm just trying to say "please have some perspective on  all  presidencies, rather than just demonizing the individual in the office." We need more nuanced political discussions/disagreements and less of this "Your guy sucks. Our guy rules" junk.  I mean seriously: Republicans are now suing Obama?  What the hell are they thinking?)   I understand silly cartoons like this are designed to push a particular point of view.  Just remember to  also  laugh with the ones from the other side and not just with the ones that reinforce our own biases. There may be a little grain of truth in the ones poking at  our  sacred cows as well as in the ones we make mocking "the idiots on the other side."
One of the results from the Engine of the Gods table has the description "a unit is called forth from Azyr to join your army". Does this count as a summoning? If it happened in a game where no units start in reserve (assuming that you hadn't been planning on summoning any units in the first place) then is that ability wasted? Or is it treated as a unit outside of the point values of the game? I'm partially inclined to agree with the latter, but that also means that Kroak or a Dread Saurian could be summoned (They're both Seraphon). How do you all feel about this? You can't CHOOSE that result, whereas Nagash can choose to cast summon zombies, so I feel like it's a free unit from the results, with the obviously broken interpretations being left up to how much of a munchkin you're playing.   Second question regarding the Stormcast Eternals Lightning Strike special rule from the Warrior Brotherhood formation, which is essentially you can put a unit anywhere on the board more than 9" away from an enemy. My opponent said that it affected everyone in the entire formation but nothing about the wording implied that to me. I would love some insight onto that
So many of the comments here-- and, indeed, Maddow's unfortunate hashing of Obama's speech-- show a complete misunderstanding of the law.     Korematsu dealt with a specific Executive Order that  set the stage  for the interment of Japanese-Americans, not specifically with the interment itself.     Suspending habeas corpus is unconstitutional, so making a law that made it illegal to suspend HC would be redundant.       Commenters also, to my mind, show a misunderstanding of what President Obama said.  Nobody seems to have heard the part about congressional and judicial oversight; in some cases that section of the speech is quoted and then overlooked entirely.  The power everybody is afraid of is power that  the President already has, thanks to Bush .  Obama is talking about taking that power away from the President, and making sure that, if such detainment is ever necessary, it is within the system of checks and balances instead of being unilateral.
I am writing this on a cellphone,  so there might be typos.   My answer is yes. Project Zomboid is worth it's price all the way. And why you might ask?   It has that feel that I've always searched for in a zombie survival game, it's so open and all about surviving. There is so much to do and so much to come. The RPG elements is in there, you have your character, and you always tend to care about that character.   It is in Early Access as you might have noticed, and alot of content is not there yet, though many things are on the way. For multiplayer, it has its own branch on Steam for multiplayer testing, and I've tried it out with a friend, and even though it might be bugs, you'll still have a blast playing it!   I hope this can help you being sure to buy it or not, and I hope you have a nice day!
PART 1    Part 1/2 This experience comes with a video which i will attach at the end of this post. The session which took place in the video is not the first nor the second session that night. If my estimation is correct, it should've been in the a.m's (early morning).   Basically me (on the right side of the clip, beanie, red vest) and a couple of mates who are mostly Hebrew speakers (including myself), attended an orthodox Jewish youth program (lol) to do exactly the opposite of what the rabbi's asked us to do, Ouija Board. So this program is a camp which was held for 2 nights and 3 days, so in the video if you're wondering where we are, we're in a shared cabin.   In the first 2 or 3 sessions (not sure) we had physical occurances, such as the electric heater sparking and starting up WITHOUT EVEN BEING CONNECTED TO THE POWERPOINT!!! The guy in the dark blue vest and the light coloured hoodie in front of me had his speakers connected to the only powerpoint available in the room, with the electric heater right beside it with its plug clearly laid out and not plugged in. Everyone in the room, as well as the spectators were amazed to see this happen. Almost forgot to mention, myself and the other two who have their fingers on the ouija board did not see the electric heater go off unplugged without the spectators pointing it out in the first place... a bit weird.   On another ouija session, everyone in the room including the spectators huddled up along and also in one of the bunk beds. And myself and the two others who are playing with the ouija board ask for the spirit to make a noise. Everyone in the room heard a gasp, a choking gasp is the best way to describe it. It was silent, but yet, everyone heard it, and everyone thought the person to their right did it. And so we started blaming each other and arguing... eventually we came to a conclusion and knew that no one else in the room did it. Also, there was no one else outside the room that could have done it. Everyone were asleep and we made sure there were no other disturbances by carefully listening to footsteps outside the door and patrolling the area every so often. Almost forgot to mention we recorded and caught this gasp on record on one of the spectator's iPad, but this spectator was never made contact with by me, nor ever uploaded the recording.                                                             PART 2    Part 2/2 Now to talk about the session which took place in the video... First off we meditated to clear our mind from anything which might disturb the session. We take ouija sessions very seriously. At the start of the video we mucked around a bit so we don't choose to do so during the session. Or for example just break out into laughter when something ridiculous comes up, and then end up losing the spirit. Anyways, in the video, you will hear the "controller" of this sessions (in the dark blue jacket, light hoodie, in front of me) asking ridiculously stupid questions, which may have angred the spirit: e.g "Are you a virgin?" "Are you a good spirit?", We all know spirits in the realm of the ouija board are not good, i never had an encounter with a good spirit myself, although i might be wrong... but my opinion stays as is.   We start the session with ridiculous questions, and we thought "let's take it a step up." and asked the spirit to read MY MIND. So we tell the spirit that "Yoad" (myself), is thinking of a number between 1-10, not too hard for a spirit, right? So i think of the number 6, but i thought let's trick this spirit, and then quickly switched to 4 as my final number. You might not be able to hear it, but i announce that the spirit got it right. And the controller of the session being good at frustrating the spirit, asks it to read his own mind, thinking this is some mind-reading game. Infuriating the spirit, it chooses to switch off the lights.   Now beware, just because someone was standing beside the door frame which was where the light switch was located... It does not mean that person flicked that light back on. Turns out no one actually flicked the light back on, everyone was paranoid and definitely shit scared for their life. Pretty much traumatized. Towards the end of the video, where we all run to find a Rabbi and inform him of this occurrence out of fear, the controller of the session asks me in Hebrew to confirm that i wasn't bullshitting when i said the spirit predicted my number right, because he was obviously creeped by that.
I'll start.   I always imagine this naked half-man with no legs (no crotch either) opening my bedroom door, hopping on to my bed just by using his hands, and stare at me. He then reaches into his belly-button, pinches it, and starts peeling his entire skin off, all of it, in one go. I can vividly  see the tissues detach. As he peels it off, he proceeds to eat it. He chews and chews and chews, and he starts drooling. He does it very slowly. He even gags sometimes, but continues to chew and swallow his entire epidermis. After he's done with the whole thing, his muscle-y face just smiles at me. He turns around by pushing down against the bed and twisting his body, hops off, and closes the door behind him.   I also imagine myself lying on this huge human grill, and four sharp, skeletal, demon hands pinching into the skin of my arms, eventually piercing them, all the way to my bones, and ripping them out. I see this in second person. So during this entire situation, I just have a slight smile on my face, which creeps me the fuck out. Oh, and then the bones magically grow back, and the process repeats.   One last: I imagine a little clown with sharp teeth (you could say a small Pennywise) laying behind me and just chewing on my hair while trying to control his maniacal laughter.   And this is why I still haven't slept and it's 9am here.
I think one of the biggest problems that everyone has a problem seeing things through the same perspective. As Christians we (at least, those of us who are actual Christians, not those who wear the name and ignore the teachings) have to balance between our lives on earth and our belief in what comes after. We're finite beings, and a belief in the infinite and what comes after our finity (which is a word I probably just made up) can lead to a lot of internal struggle. We fight our own sins and temptations, and as a result we often become those who would cast the first stone. I don't think Jesus taught that adultery was an ok practice (Quite the opposite!), but I do believe that he taught we should never destroy or judge another person for their sins. We should tell them they are wrong, of course, but after that it's the individual's decision. I don't believe homosexuality is ok, but it's not my job to decide another's life. Which is why I'm neutral in the political arena. I honestly don't see how it's my fight.
Hello, I received my [Cloupor Mini]( on 1/7/14 and I have not put it down yet.   I purchased a brand new [Samsung 25r]( to mate with this device, as I like using one battery for the entire life of the device.     Pictures:   [Front](   [Screen Side](   [Back](   [Side](   [Bottom](   [Screen Closeup](   [Battery in Device](   [Battery out of carrier](   [Device with Tank](   [Device with Tank in Hand](     Specs:     Size: 77.5mm X 36mm X 22mm    Variable Wattage and Voltage   Precise down to 0.01ohm   Adjustable 510 pin   Subohm capable (0.45-3.0ohm)   Removeable Battery   Vaping time counter (limited at 15seconds)   Left and Right mode   Magnetic back cover   Pass through capable   Micro USB charger plug   Takes an 18650 battery   Over charge protection   Reverse Battery Protection   7-30 Watts | 3.6-7.0 Volts   Can be turned off, rather than just locked       Packaging:   The mod comes in a box [exactly like this]( but for the mini.   It comes with a few things:     VIP Serial number card   Small blue screwdriver   Various replacement screws / repair items   Velvet bag for the device   Retractable Micro USB Charger cable     [All Items, minus the bag](   The box was also wrapped in plastic when it arrived. The velvet bag was a nice touch, although I do not see myself ever using it. The screwdriver works and is added to my massive tiny tool collection. The replacement parts and VIP card were stored for later use.     Initial Impressions:   The mod is very sleek. I purchased the silver version and it is truly silver. The words "Cloupor" and "Mini" are engraved in the front of the device extremely cleanly. The side has five cleanly engraved lines in it, giving the device some character, not as bland looking. The magnetic back piece has seven rows of fifteen dots, giving some grip to remove the cover. Dreadfully, the micro USB charging point in on the bottom of the device. The buttons are sleek, perfectly round, no rattling like we found in many of the iStick devices. The screen is very bright, shows the standard Ohm, Voltage, Wattage, and battery life readings.   This is a very small device. This device next to my iStick is almost the exact same height, being slightly wider to accommodate the 18650 it stores. The battery takes up roughly half of the devices internals and fits with just a tenth of an inch or so left in the top and bottom of the device. It also comes with a small sleeve to easily remove the battery because it is such a tight fit. You put the battery through the [small black sleeve]( then insert the battery into the device. When you need to remove the battery, you pull the sleeve and the battery comes out with ease. That is another small but very convenient feature of this device.     Using the device:   With your three standards buttons the device is easy to use. Firing button, and two menu buttons. Tap the firing button five times to turn the device on or off. Tap the up button and the firing button at the same time for three seconds to change to right / left handed mode. Firing button fires the mod, menu buttons move up and down in voltage and wattage. A small instruction booklet comes with the device, showing you how to lock the wattage / voltage and other helpful things.   I really enjoy the locking feature for wattage and voltage, that means you can have the device on in your pocket and not worry about adjusting the wattage / voltage with your thigh or jeans.     Tanks:   I've tried two tanks with this mod. [Aspire Nautilus]( and [Kangertech Subtank](     Kangertech Subtank:     I've used both premade coils, and built coils with the [Mini]( The tank is FAR too big for this device, there is notable overhang and it makes the device extremely top heavy. This is not a convenient for the mini.   Builds:     Dual coil .45ohm build   Premade .5ohm coil     Dual coil build: This thing RIPS. Multiple people were taken by surprise with vapor production from the mini, being able to go to 30watts on this small of a device is pretty confusing to people.   Prebuilt: Nearly the same results, people are surprised, lots of vapor, etc.     Aspire Nautilus:     This is a perfect tank for this device. I used the prebuilt 1.6ohm coils, and it works perfectly. I can go to 15watts or so without a dry hit, great vapor, no issues. There is a TINY amount of overhang on the button side of the device, but nothing extreme or annoying to me. The device fits flush on both the front (Logo side) and back (Magenetic side) of the device. This is a great mate for the mini.     Durability & Quality:   This device is heavy for its size. It is not bothersome in any way, just takes some people by surprise. It is made of quality materials and every piece fits together perfectly. The quality was extremely surprising. I did not expect this great of quality at that price. There are NO sharp edges on the device including the magnetic back. The magnets are strong enough to not come undone in your pocket. Amazing built quality in total.     Final Notes:   I thoroughly enjoyed the device, I have no qualms for the price and quality of the device. The charger port is on the bottom (WHEN WILL THEY LEARN). Constructed of high grade materials, beautiful finish, works properly, damn good battery life, and sub ohm capable. Price and size taken into account, this is an amazing device and I would recommend it to anyone without issue.
So this is a long and complicated story. I'll do my best to summarize and keep it as succinct as possible.   My mother-in-law is a widow of 2 years now. She's in her late 50's and was married at 19. She's extremely vulnerable, stubborn, and simply not very bright. After her husband passed, she had no interest in dating. She was seemingly content to live out the rest of her life alone. However, recently, she informed my wife that she was talking to someone. She was at the hospital for some health issues and met a guy. He was working in the hospital on the computer systems. He is a business owner from Finland living in the US. He is also a widow with a daughter who normally lives with him but is currently overseas visiting her grandmother back in Finland.   As my MiL hadn't dated since the 70s, she was very reluctant. He pursued and she eventually relented to sending emails back and forth. After about 2 months of emails, she finally gave him her phone number and they started texting. Texting turned into phone calls. They are now at the point where they want to meet in person and start having a real relationship. At first, I was very happy for her. She's a pain in the ass and is essentially helpless as an adult so she relies heavily on my wife to handle a lot of things for her that she lacks the cognitive or physical capacity to handle herself. I felt this would be great for both her and my wife. She finally opened up to my wife and her sister about it and was willing to talk about it with about 5-6 people. My SiL, in her true spoiled brat fashion, freaked out and refused to accept this. My wife was supportive so my MiL opened up a lot to her about some things. The more I hear, the more I (and my wife) am fairly convinced that this is not kosher.   Now all of the following can be one big coincidence and he could be Prince fuckin' Charming. But, these are all the reasons I think this is a scam in some way, shape, or form. Individually, they all seem superficial and inconsequential but when you add them all up, something is off.     He was dying to spend time with her in the beginning but she wasn't ready. Now that she is ready, he's really busy with work. He said that as soon as he's done with this big project, he's going to take 2 months off and they'll have time to spend together, yet they haven't spent one day together from the day they met in the hospital.     He supposedly looks like "Jon Snow's father." I've never seen him before so I can't verify. But someone who looks like this, is several years younger than my MiL, and is a wildly business owner is unlikely to go for someone like my MiL...a frumpy half-assed housewife.     He played the fellow widow card. He claimed he was getting a divorce as he moved to the US and she stayed in Finland. Then, in the process of the divorce, she passed away. Details of her death are unclear to me and my wife.     My MiL won't give any information other than his first name. This is not his fault but I can't verify anything about this person without so much as a last name (RE: alias).       Here's the kicker that set this wheel in my head in motion.     He claimed that while his daughter was in Finland and supposed to come back home to America this week, she was in a severe car accident. The doctors told his mother that it was unclear as to whether she was going to make it through or not. My MiL was naturally very upset by this. She is about to go in for a breast reconstruction surgery this week (she's an inflammatory breast cancer survivor) and the timing is very convenient.     Now I could be reading WAY too much into this and I 1000% hope I am. But all of these things together make me 95% sure this guy is not on the level. Call it intuition. So my question is, with such little information to go off of, and with my MiL knowing as little as possible, how can I proceed to make sure she doesn't get hurt financially or otherwise?
I've tried to make my thoughts on this meta as clear as I can, which is to say I do not believe that soul level-limited pvp is a good idea. It's an outdated tradition that is holding on long past its time, due in large part to some common misconceptions held by many dark souls players (everyone will be a havelmage, high level pvp is boring, there's no variety, pvp will die off if we don't stick together, etc...)   I'm at sl 200 currently and it's as fun as ever, perhaps moreso now that I'm not getting oneshot by GRS (my bane since starting DaS2 pvp) because I mistimed a roll. I honestly believe in high level pvp, having done it in the previous dark souls for some time. The build variety remains, since you can't possibly use every armor set, every weapon and every ring at the same time. Equipment replaces stats as the means of defining your fighting style, plus the all important skill factor.
I think I'll use an example in my response.   Halo 3, in my opinion, has the most memorable soundtrack out of every video game I have ever played. If you've ever played Halo before you'll know of it's grandeur in pretty much every aspect, like the planets, the Forerunners, the Flood, the age of the conflicts, the size of the battlefields etc. And because the soundtrack reflects so well a sense of epic size and awesome scope the two tie in so perfectly. Martin O' Donnell, the composer of most of the Halo soundtracks, used a live orchestra with his recordings (except for Halo 2). Orchestral music and its ability to sound so unique even when there are only a few instruments playing is one of the reasons why the soundtrack always sounded so magnificent. I point to [Roll Call]( to help illustrate this point.   Also, there is a theme that is present throughout every single song and is easily recognizable and distinguishable from other soundtracks. In Halo is is predominantly the use of the choir in some of the main songs but also in some it is the use of the piano as a main musical instrument. In [Never Forget]( the piano is the heart of the song, and is incredibly emotive in its use.   I think that can be a new point entirely actually, emotion. In order to love something and in order for it to be memorable you need to feel attached, you need to have some sort of emotion towards it. The Halo soundtracks convey a sense of emotion in every single song which is the reason why I love it. I get shivers when I hear Never Forget, I get excited when I hear [Finish The Fight]( and I feel sad when I hear[ Wake Me When You Need Me]( simply because they remind me of all the awesome, thrilling, and sad times I have had playing that wonderful game.
The incest taboo came about because closely related parents are more likely to pass down hereditary illnesses to their kids. If both carry a recessive gene for flippers, then they're more likely to have a kid with flippers even if they don't have flippers themselves.   Of course, humans have evolved quite a bit in the last several thousand years. Random mutations created hereditary diseases. The children of Adam and Eve wouldn't have had the same taboo, because there was much less to worry about and they wouldn't have any knowledge of those diseases even if they existed.
Got drunk a few years ago with my friend and decided to make pigs in a blanket. Took a bag of Bisquick out of the box and for reason reason swung it around like I was gonna toss it to my buddy. The bag was weak, so the entire contents of the bag flew across my kitchen. It got all over my friend, my dads new leather coat I bought him as a present, the shades, shoes, coat closet, ceiling, walls, pet water bowl. It took me like 6 months to finally stop finding it in things.
Hi all, need a few pointers as Im not sure what the proper technique is...   The other day I decided to poke the bike with a stick a bit and see how it would start to bite back. 2nd gear with a moderately fast roll on gets the front end off the ground about 1-2inches. I basically maintain that with throttle control with not much effort. 1st gear on the other hand is an entirely different beast, same type of roll on the bike comes up in a split second around 1-1.5 feet. I wasn't expecting that to be honest, and my reaction was to roll off the throttle (a little too quickly as I put her down much to hard for my taste).   Im not looking to find the balance point, or even clutch up. Most of the tips are coming from guys that stunt or want to stunt, I'd like to look at this from a race perspective. In a power wheelie, what is the best way to keep control? I've looked at some photos from motogp and it seems some riders do cover the rear brake while others do not. I personally ride on the balls of my feet, but obviously im not able to cover from that position. Is it just another case of learning throttle control during a wheelie or should I change my footing to cover the rear brake?
For background, me and my girlfriend started dating about 10 months ago, shortly before I left to go to college 7 hours away.   I should start this by saying that she has not came and visited me once at university, and I have came home several times to see her. As such, last Sunday when we were skyping I told her how disappointed I was that she wasn't going to be able to come see me at college, as she had promised that she would. I had known for a long time that this would be the last weekend that would work out for both of us, and had told her so several times. Unfortunately she was scheduled to work all weekend, so it ended up not working out, or so I thought. It is also important to note that my mom had been texting her trying to work out if she could go with or not.   So Wednesday comes, and she doesn't text me all day, turns out her mom took her phone away. Her mom had seen one of our conversations where we were talking about topics of sexual nature and is apparently very mad. She punished her by saying that she could never use electronics in her room, and that she could also never come visit me at college.   This is wear her story starts to not add up. I asked my girlfriend when her mom had read our conversation, but she said that she didn't know. This struck me as odd, because that would mean she would've had to sneak into her room and take her phone. I have a pretty close with her relationship with her mom, and it doesn't seem like something she would do, and hasn't done anything like this before.   Second, she told me that she was very upset, because she was planning on coming with my parents to visit me this weekend, and had gotten people to take all of her shifts at work, but then she was forced to take them all back. This made me suspicious for two reasons, because she never told my mom that she had gotten people to take her shifts and she could go with. Also, when I asked her who had taken her shifts, she got very defensive.   Third, she asked if I had told my parents what was going on. I told her that I did, because I wanted them to hear it from me,  not someone else, and she said I shouldn't have because it was between us.   Next, her mom hasn't said anything to me. We have a pretty good relationship. And she's told me before when she took my girlfriend's phone away.   Finally, it's just so convenient. Just a few days ago I told her that it wasn't going to work out for her to come visit me, but she reinforced her promise she made a long time ago that she was still going to come down. Then two days later she magically isn't allowed to come visit me.   Reddit, am I being paranoid here, or should I be worried?
In the course of doing some Wikipedia "research," I stumbled upon [the article on bhang](   I asked my friend (ethnically Indian, living in Canada) about bhang and its (alleged) traditional use. He took great issue with the claims the article made, especially these:   > Bhang has been used in India since Vedic times, and is an integral part of Hindu culture. Sadhus and Sufis use Bhang to boost meditation and to achieve transcendental states. Bhang or cannabis is also used amongst Sufis as an aid to spiritual ecstasy.   > The tradition of consuming bhang during Holi is particularly common in North India where Holi itself is celebrated with a fervor unseen elsewhere. Bhang is heavily consumed inMathura, an ancient town of religious importance to the Hindus. Here the practice is believed to have been introduced by the followers of LordKrishna and has stayed ever since. They begin the preparation by Sanskrit chants and recitation of prayers. In Mathura, some people take Bhang to work up their appetite while others do it to de-stress. But the hub of bhang use is Varanasi (or Banaras) where the bhang is prepared on its famous ghats.   He says that:     The commonness of the practice is overblown, both amongst Hindus and Sufis. It's primarly practiced by hermits.     It's comparatively rare     Calling it "an integral part of Hindu culture" is unfair     The sources are agendized Western sources&#8212;either bad information from colonial days or current scholars engaging in wishful thinking       He chalks it up to Indology, i.e. westerners intentionally misrepresentating Indian culture&#8212;in his opinion for imperialist reasons.   I'm genuinely curious to hear what anyone might have to say about this. Obviously my options for learning about Indian culture and history are limited, and my friend's assertion isn't just that my sources are limited, but that they are so flawed and agendized that literally all I can get is a propagandistic view of India.   If anyone has any thoughts&#8212;either about the quality of western scholarship of India, in general, or of the claims made about bhang, in particular, it'd be helpful.
I'm trying to be as pleasant as possible about this, as I don't want to seem too negative. To be frank, the pictures of beer in bottles or a glass are getting old. I would like this to be a place of learning. A place for technical discussion, sharing techniques, how-to, DIY, ect.. I know that's not my decision and that isn't how reddit works, but maybe as a community we can make it happen.   It just really bugs me how much of the threads are pictures of beer without a recipe or anything. They get upvoted to the top, but there is usually no useful discussion happening in the comments. It ends up pushing the informative threads down to the bottom. I know people are very proud of their creations, but we've all seen beer before. I don't even really care if they post a recipe, or if they made their own labels. It's just not very useful information as we don't even know what the beer tastes or smells like.   So anyways rant over. Sorry if you disagree. I would take homebrew memes over beer pictures any day HA!
Most faces are that way. Heels make good long term champs because they always win cheaply, and you want to see the face kick their ass.   Most stories, books, movies, video games, whatever, end with the good guys winning. And we all love that, but usually, it signals end of the story. When a sequel is made, the hero has been defeated or is facing a new challenge.   That challenge to overcome the bad guy is what moves the plot and keeps things interesting. If Rocky had actually retired and lived happily ever after with Adrian after the first one, they wouldn't have made 5 sequels.
Can we get another thing straight?  The real problem is that the government spends  way too much .  It amazes me how so many people would rather bicker over who should get screwed with taxes rather than scrutinize the fed's insane spending habits.  It's like listening to some idiot with too much credit card debt insisting that they "don't have a spending problem - they just don't make enough money!"
UPDATE:   Just got the gun back from the S&W factory. They changed out the ejector. Shoots like a dream now. Moral of the story: never doubt FC. :) Thanks all     A little backstory: I'm a female shooter with medium-sized hands. I've got six years of shooting and a lot of good training under my belt. I run an HK USP 9mm full size. Yes I know it's slightly too big for me but I've always been able to compensate. I recently took a handgun class with 21st Century Gunfighters/Stephen Pineau (great teacher, if you ever get a chance to take one of his classes, do so, I highly recommend it). He made some changes to my stance and grip (took me from a modified Weaver to more of an Isosceles stance) and now the HK is obviously just way too big for me, and I need to change platforms. I'd reached a point where the gun was holding me back.   Stephen runs with a lot of M&Ps and had me try his, so I knew the grip was smaller and could work, plus it was a striker fire... no more dealing with my HK's HEAVY double-action plus decocker lever... I was on board with getting a striker-fire pistol. I didn't like the M&P's trigger, but I knew I could get an Apex done, no problem.   Sooo I started searching for an M&P. They used to be a dime a dozen till the shit hit the fan around here lately. I FINALLY found one at a gun show. Paid a reasonable price.   Took it to the range with some standard PMC range ammo, nothing crazy. Damn thing started kicking the brass STRAIGHT BACK into my mouth. Consistently. Every time. So I had the RSO try it (older guy, retired military, ret. police officer). Did the same thing to him. Ok so it's not just me, good to know.   Went home and did a little research online. Apparently this is NOT AN UNCOMMON problem with M&Ps, just one I had never heard of. Lots of people suggesting I change out the ejector. Or the extractor. Or the recoil spring.   Went back to the gun range and talked the gunsmith on site. He filed down the ejector a little. Tested it, and it was still kicking brass into my face. Filed it again, now kicking into my hat. Got frustrated and left.   Went home and decided to buy a new ejector from MidwayUSA. It's only a $3.00 part and would be the cheapest way to fix the problem. MidwayUSA, by the way, has a policy that if you spend under $25 on their site they're going to get more money out of you by adding a fee. Not cool, Midway. Not cool.   Took it back to the gunsmith to install the ejector. I also brought him an Apex duty/carry kit for the trigger, thinking that I didn't want the lightest trigger I could find but wanted a less gritty trigger than what the gun came with.   An hour later, he comes out and tells me Midway sent me the wrong ejector (WTF MIDWAY) but that he had the correct part on hand so he went ahead and put it in. Tested the gun again. I swear to God, the stupid casings are going ALL OVER THE PLACE. Some will still hit me in the hat. Some will land on my arm. One tried to go down my shirt. A couple would go straight forward, or off to the left. WTF. I KNOW it's NOT a grip problem. And on top of that, the trigger barely has a perceptible reset and I can hardly stand it. There's too much damn travel if you miss the reset.   The same RSO from before was there again. He suggested changing out the recoil spring with one of their rental guns to see if that fixed the problem. Not really. The casings do not reliably go ANYWHERE. They just go EVERYWHERE.   Between the ejector problem and the crappy-ass trigger, I'm about to just throw this gun in a lake. I guess I'm going to have to send the thing back to S&W and let them deal with it. What blows my mind is they test-fired this gun TWICE at S&W.. how they did not notice the brass going straight back to 6 o'clock is beyond me.   Thanks for letting me rant, Gunnit. Any suggestions you might have would be appreciated.
Not everyone wants those cats to be out and about.  That's the difference.   For example, I live in a neighborhood with a huge farm.  It's right behind my house.  The cats from all across the neighborhood come to my house before going hunting for mice in the farm.  Do I know all of those cats and most of their owners?  Yes.  Do I think of them as more than strays?  No, because they're in my lawn more than at their occasional home base.   One day, a neighbor's cat was running in the street.  It started running alongside a car, and was stupid enough to then run under the car.   Whose fault is that?  Is it the driver of the car, or is it the owner who lets their cats out for days at a time?  I would argue the "owner" of the cat, who doesn't take any precautions to protect either the cat or the neighbors.  In fact, the owners are completely selfish for adopting an animal and then putting everyone in a terrible position by refusing to take care of it.
UPDATE: I'm going to go through with the bankruptcy as it sounds like it can't affect my parents and it will be thrown out that I have to pay. Thanks for the help.   Please don't pass judgement for what happened, I just need advice moving forward.   I am currently working a full-time job but still living at home with my parents and siblings. There is no issue with me remaining at home and my parents are kind enough to not charge me rent and let me save up. However, I was recently taken to small claims court to the tune of $15,000 and lost over what I can chalk up as a misunderstanding and not being properly notified I was on the hook for these payments.   Essentially, I was living with my cousin in her townhome and when she moved abroad for a work-study semester, she never told me that I would have to keep paying rent as her mortage got paid off the month of her leaving and I was helping put money toward these payments. She told me if I had any issues with the townhouse, I should talk to her mom, my aunt, and to look after the place. I rightly assumed that this meant I would be pretty much house-sitting now that the mortgage was paid off and since she never came after me for rent payments once she left (she went to Tokyo to work), I didn't bother paying. When she got back, she took me to small claims because there was no rent money and my aunt never told me. But then they said that my aunt tried to call me several times and then she had an accident and was in the hospital for a long time and didn't have time to come after me, but no one said anything.   Regardless, the judge said I had to pay, but I had since moved back home and it has been some time (almost a year) of me living with my parents after I hit a rough patch and had to take a lower paying job. I think it's unfair of them to expect me to pay this money they never said anything about and I don't want to dig into any of my money or start carving up my paycheques to deal with this. My boss suggested that I just take the credit hit and declare bankruptcy.   Would that absolve me of the debt to my cousin?   Thanks for reading!
Yesterday, 3 friends and I visited the Rhein Ruhr Whisky Fair held in Düsseldorf, Germany.   The fair was held at the Classic Remise which is an old Railway Roundhouse that has been converted into a classic car storage facility / showroom / renovation centre.   The fair started at 12:00 and continued till 20:00 (we left at around 18:30).  Cost was €10 to enter which got us a tasting glass and lanyard to hold it.  We booked tickets in advance which seemed to be a good idea as there was a large queue at one point of people who had just turned up on the day and they seemed to have stopped letting people in at one point.   We also paid an extra €25 euros for a one hour talk and tasting with Graeme Bowie, the Distillery Manager at Ardnamurchan. This is a new Distillery being built by Adelphi.   As part of this we tasted:   Fascadale Batch 6 (Clynelish), 46%, 12 years.   Glenrothes 2007, 67.7%, 7 years, Cask. 3519, 1st fill sherry.   Benriach 1990, 52.9%, 23 years, Cask. 10698, refill sherry.   Bunnahabhain 1989, 47.2%, 24 years, Cask. 5787, refill bourbon.   Adelphi Private Stock Reserve Blend.   The atmosphere in the main fair was superb as was the location with some great cars to look.   There were a good selection of Distilleries and private bottlers with lots of bottles to sample. Far to many to choose from.  Samples were generally 2cl and ranged from €1 to €8 for the ones I tried.   Between the 4 of us, we tried and sniffed a great deal of Whisky. The ones I remember trying in no particular order:   The Maltman Mortlach 22yr   Coal Ila Moch   Kavalan Taiwanese Whiskey   Bruichladdich Black Art   Octomore   Lost Distilleries Auchnagie   Lost Distilleries Gerston   Slyrs Pedro Ximenex Finish   Laing's Old Particular Laphroaig 15yr   Sansibar Tomintoul 46yr   Edradour Sauternes Finish   We will be going back next year.
Thomas Nickerson]( was an ancestor of mine. He was the cabin boy on the USS Essex, the whaling ship that was wrecked by a whale and inspired  Moby Dick . He spent weeks adrift in the pacific, witnessed horrors of starvation, cannibalism, etc. His diary is the best surviving account of the tragedy. He was only 14 at the time.
Back in high school when i was working out over the summer for the upcoming football season, I would cover my bedroom windows with blankets so i can come home and nap peacefully in the afternoon. I was napping for about an hour and a half and my friend broke into my house and entered my room. He stood above me breathing heavily, watching me sleep, until i eventually woke up.
Hey, being on this sub reddit I've noticed a general consensus that using a test kit before a trip to check if what you have is what it should be is a definite. Specifically when dealing with higher-risk drugs.  Recently a friend group of mine has been thinking of going down the LSD road for the first time and I was wondering if anyone had a few pointers about test kits.  Mainly where to obtain one - I reside in Canada.  And how to use it properly.  We are experienced users and are excited for our first sid trip!
It has to be said, that Hackaday did make a few horrendous calculation mistakes in their post. They measured the extraction speed from a video "about 13 centimeters [..] in five seconds". They later kept on calculating with an extrusion speed of 13cm / second. Thus, they are assuming the pen can extrude filament 5 times faster, requiring 5 times more engery, than it actually would. This makes their whole argumentation simply wrong. In addition to that, their calculation is off by another factor of 10, because the "13 centimeters" measured, are actually about 13 millimeters.
Me and my ex broke up because of her needing some space, and because we both sucked at communication. Shes been telling me along that she maybe wanted to come back A lot have happend and she now saying that we should start with being friends and from there see what happends. She said that there were a possiblity for us to end togther. Problem: Should i try being friends with her? or should i just say i cant. its either all me or not me.
I just want to shave and not have an issue every time. If its impossible I will just accept trimmed beard culture.   My problem:   Whenever I shave I get ache within a day or two specifically near the corners of my mouth, but also any other area around my face. My face always painful to touch the day after shaving which i assume is razor burn but i use an aloe shaving cream with my razor so I don't know why, and I try not to shave right down to the skin, aka i can feel minor whiskers when my hand brushes over my chin. I've tried going right down to the skin (shaving against the grain) but it doesn't make a difference. The ache appears more dramatically after I go to bed, whether my pillowcase is fresh or not. Basically its a time game once I've finished shaving. To early and later in the day my face will start to break out from rubbing against my clothing and moving in general. So I only have a few hours that my face wont react for whatever reason I needed to shave. I would shave regularly if I didn't have this problem. I am a fan of beards but don't an electric trimmer, and I'm not interested in buying one if I have this problem trimming too.   Information Influences     The reason I wasn't taught to shave without this problem is because my father gave up on that. He uses a safe chemical burn he applies every morning to clear his whiskers. I, however, am really uninterested in using something that literally burns my hairs off, safe or not. He told me that his hairs are basically curled under his skin after shaving and kinda become ingrown.    My friend's dad suggest I go with him for a professional barber shave. He says that razors are crap and that a man needs a good clean shave every now and then. I have doubts that he understands my specific problem, but he is mostly Polish/British, heavily overweight, and keeps his beard about 2-3 centimeters long. He's rich so paying for a professional is not really a concern of his. Unfortunately I'm still in college on a budget.     Areas effected from greatest to least  (starting from most often)     Corners of mouth   Chin   Cheeks   Jaw   In between eyebrows (minor)  might be regular ache     Nothing below my jaw or on my neck  Example   My background:     22 yrs old - male - 5'11 - 160 lb - good health - No Pets - decent diet - omnivore    My beard grows pretty slow 2 days for 5 o'clock 3 days stubble, but it grows fully. I don't grow much of a mustache ಥ_ಥ , but its a cross between Lincoln and Wolverine.   Allergies - (10/10) Dust (this is probably making my reactions worse), 6/10 Cats, 3/10 Dogs, Hamsters, and Cockroaches. No food allergies.   Black/White - Half African American Half Mixed Caucasian (Cameroon/European idk where though)   Born in north east United states (still living there)   To be fair i don't wash my pillowcase and blankets as much as I should, but i do use multiple pillows. (once a semester wash) but this problems persists at home as well. even after my room has been cleaned, and those pillows haven't been used more than once.      Current Method  ( strikeout  = gave up using)     Electric Razor:  Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D   Mostly a Gillette User: Fusion Manual 5 blade head   Shaving cream: Barbasol Soothing Aloe,  Gillette brand ,  Edge brand   Before/Aftershave: Lectric Shave   Swelling and redness reducer: Mentholatum     Recently:   I had the idea because my ache shows up after I sleep more that its because my pores are too open after shaving. So after some research I figured out that Vaseline covers up pores so for the last few days I've been trying aftershave, Mentholatum, then Vaseline. but it doesn't seem to be working. Though it does seem like my face is in less pain. But as you can imagine I don't venture out when I've done this, and I'm a side sleeper so it comes off while i sleep.   Side note   If there is a way I could shave with the electric razor I got for Christmas that would be great, cause it cost my dad a lot. Shaving is not a problem for my entire body just face and chest. Also. How the fuck do people shave their pits. I could probably Google that one tho.
Like the title suggest, I got an email from a recruiter from a major tech firm yesterday asking if I was still interested in a position and that she would like to set up a phone interview this week. I replied back, but haven't heard anything since the original email.   The original job posting was a couple months ago, and it said to send my resume to a department email rather than go through the company's career page. This job is also on the other side of the country from me and my resume clearly said so, so I feel like I've actually got a good shot at the job and have passed at least some initial round of screening.
Ah, I see. So you do want them as parameters.   So as far as I understand you have a parent abstract class Publication that you're subclassing - do you have to make a Publication subclass for each type of Book? ComicBookPublication and such? or are you supposed to have one Publication class and have it handle different types of books? Or is it up to you to decide?   See, if your base class is Book and it has all types of subclasses, you can just implement one method  removePublication(Book book)  inside Publication class and it will work with every instance of the Book subclass  right "out of the box".   If you're supposed to have different subclasses for Publication, you can still maintain an ArrayList of the Book type and implement  remove  method once, in a parent class:   public class Publication {          protected ArrayList&lt;Book&gt; listOfBooks;           public boolean removePublication(Book book) {                 listOfBooks.remove(book);           }     }        ComicBookPublication will then inherit its own ArrayList of comic books, and BookPublication will have its own arraylist of some other books, and  remove  method will work on each respective list without you having to make it abstract and override it for every subclass - that's why we have a Book base class to begin with. When you create an abstract class, you want to make sure that some subclass' behavior will be  different  from that of another subclass - that's why you override the abstract method depending on the subclass.   p.s. before I confuse the rest of bejeezus out of you, maybe link to an assignment or
Hi, I'm Greg. Sometimes Gregory, it really depends on what the circumstance is. I'm male, 22 and am fairly new to the world of... well, fantasies. So what I like? I'm not entirely sure. I know that I like the idea of being a master but, at the same time, I also am not against the thought of being the slave. Pegging is fine, what some call weird (I call 'different') isn't off limits, I just may take some time to warm up to the idea. My hard limit is I can't do guys. I'm straight but hold absolutely no judgment if you're not. It's cool and fine with me, I just ask that boundaries be respected. Also, didn't know what scat was and just looked it up... that's probably a hard limit too. Intense pain is also probably a no-go... cause I'm a bit of a wuss. I like the idea of combining the two types of families, suspense can be a good thing!   I realize that there is no history with this account (as said in the side bar) but this isn't a throw away account, it's more of... my alter ego. I've always kind of wanted to get and do different things like this, but I also don't want my friends to be judgmental. Plus, I'm a secret santa this year so that would be a bit embarrassing as well haha
Yes, in my opinion you should be "stocking up on tactical information." That's what the medic class is all about. While your other team members have to think about aiming and stuff like that, a medic has to have the strategy behind the game.   Since you're new to the game, I figured that you don't really know how to go about getting this information, so I made a quick guide on some advantages and how they pertain to medic.   Basically you should be keeping track of advantages, and knowing the consequences of not having or having advantages.   Track the other team's uber percentage (other threads explaining this if you are lost) and use this information to make calls. If you have a full uber advantage, you can "dry push" or use the threat of an uber to push the other team out, or if your pocket tells you that the other team is holding close to a choke point, and you have full uber advantage, solo uber into them and kill them all.   If you have an uber disadvantage, tell your team not to die, and play passively. Try to spam the other team as they walk through choke; coordinated spam will oftentimes force a medic to pop without sacrificing anybody. Then you have the uber advantage. Another option is to sacrifice a player, usually a roamer but sometimes a scout, in order to make the medic pop his uber or kill the medic before he gets the uber.   Keep track of player advantages. if you are down one player, be wary that they may push you if they also have uber advantage. If not, then most teams won't push off of a single player advantage. If you are down two players, however, you should probably play back a little bit and be ready to escape when they push you.   Know who on their team is down and what that means. Conversely, know who is down on your team and what that means.. If the demo goes down on the other team, a dry push is probably viable because they will most likely, but not always, be playing far way from choke, and they won't have any stickies on the choke. If a medic is down, you can dry push as well, and just tell your team to play around your medic and bully them out with your healing advantage. Be sure to tell your team not to die or overextend, and stay near you so that you can save them. If your demo is down, play farther back so that they cannot wipe your team a choke. Your team doesn't have stickies there, so don't be playing near choke.   Related to knowing who is up, if their medic goes down, you should be ready for them to sacrifice a player in order to kill you, the medic. You should tell your team this to make them aware. Look into the skies for bombing soldiers, and ask a scout to play nearer to you so that he can shoot him in the air and deny him. If your medic (you) goes down, you must tell you teammates to sack for the medic or get out of the fight. It is their choice. Neutralizing the uber advantage, however, is very important in this game. If both medics go down, it is a great time to steal an advantage and go with the Kritzkreig. If you make this choice, however, be sure to tell a scout or you pocket to meet you at the spawn door in order to build the kritz as fast as possible. (Kritz build faster than Uber, in case you were wondering why this works.) Bomb a soldier in through choke to distract them, and bring you demo man in, kritz on him, and watch the killfeed with satisfaction: your decision gave your team great success!   You also have to have your medic mechanics down well in order to be a great medic: flashing ubers, milking, dodging, surfing, positioning, etc. While mechanics are important, the joy of medic, at least the joy that I get from playing, is the mental aspect. Some days I am too tired to focus enough to keep track of all of these things happening in any given game, but when I can do it, the medic class really shines.
i see it more mathematically, double XP has a monetary equivalent at the price of mountain dew or doritos so $9-$10 for 2 hours or so depending on where you live, plus you also get the beverage or snack which you may have bought anyway. There are 14 tokens you can receive in total, 5 classes you can unlock, 2 emblem packages (if memory serves), a reset at level 10 (unsure if you can reset more than once). That leaves 6 tokens to squander. I haven't gotten around to prestiging my mw2, mw1, or waw but when i get around to it, I will probably use it on the titles and perhaps to reset stats. I started with one token from blops, almost done with my first prestige and took the MSR and portable radar with me. I plan on using my last 5 tokens (level 5-10) on classes, and the remaining on equiptment  (MP7, RSASS, Assassin, not sure of what to use the last token on).
So about three weeks ago, my girlfriend came back from a vacation at her mother's and within 20 minutes she sat me down, explained that she was leaving me, and was moving out the following day. She was gone the next day by noon, having already made arrangements to stay with her sister and have her items put into storage.   I told her at the time that as we were both still on the lease that she was still responsible for her half of rent, heating oil, electricity, water, and internet. All our mutual bills. She agreed.   The problem came because as a school teacher (substitute) she had decided to take the summer off and was pretty poor. I frankly don't care that she's poor, in my mind that's 100% her fault now.   I've been after her to pay for her half of things. So far I've only received rent but have ~$400 in bills that she is refusing to pay her half until she gets paid again in September.   I told her that this was unacceptable. The only recourse I can think of to force her into payment is that she has been working small jobs throughout the summer and the checks keep coming to my address. I don't want to hold onto them until she pays but I believe that this may be the only way to make her pay.   I've tried talking with her to no avail. She said that she is uncomfortable with putting bills on her credit card when she doesn't have full-time employment, but neither am I, as I am rather poor due to an unexpected move and being left with our dog. I know that she at least has some money because she's been travelling to places ~3hrs from where we lived for different events during the past few weeks.
The project is based on "visual rhetoric," and the assignment is to create a short video that, with its use of images, sound, and some text clearly portrays some strong message or thesis. It also must be based in some way on some fantasy fiction or magical realism.   For my video, I'd like to focus on Siddhartha's discovery of peace and oneness in the river in Hermann Hesse's "Siddhartha". My thesis is vaguely something like finding miraculous in the common, answering life's questions through nature, etc. So, I need a song that incorporates these themes and hopefully relates them to a river in some way.
POST FOR STRAGGLERS:   Copious amounts of pot mixed with copious amounts of alcohol make one hell of a combination. STORY TIME KIDS!   I broke up with him because the pot use was insane and frankly I got tired of dating a wall. I, stupid me, agreed to the "Lets be friends!" thing and at first, I appreciated him more as a friend than a lover.   Well, my mother decides she wants to host a Super Sunday feast and decides to invite him over (with my permission). So needless to say, he comes over and with my mother's permission uses our laundry machines yadda yadda yadda. Yeah, all is going well. He then starts drinking. And drinking. Goes into my backyard to to take a few hits of pot, and keeps drinking....   MY dad gets thoroughly drunk with him and calls it quit. But he keeps drinking. YIKES. He polished off half a bottle of vodka, five -  FIVE  - 40oz cans of beer, a few shots of whiskey, was now into my mother's  cooking  sherry and had now polished off a bowl of weed (it may not be crazy, but that there is one fuck of a problem).   What got me was the fact he was able to form coherent sentences and form thoughts, however, he couldn't shut the fuck up. Kept talking and talking and talking..... My mother and I decided it was high time for him to go home. However, when someone is that loaded - they think they  are home  - and kept stalling. I literally had to shove him and his laundry towards the fucking car. All the while he was talking about the commercials for the Super Bowl.   We get him home, I get him tucked in like a 4 year old, and go home. Its now late and I at this point in my life am a substitute teacher. If I am called in the next morning, I'll be lucky to get 5 hours of sleep. I am showered, in bed, and my phone rings. It's him. I answer to make sure he's not sick and need his stomach pumped. NOPE! He wants a booty call.   I explain to him I work and need to get some rest and good night - blah blah blah. Hang up - go to bed and... HE CALLS ME AGAIN! I answer, a little pissed. He is  crying  at this point about how he still loves me, and is trying to guilt me into his life by saying he doesn't think he'll live to be 40 - and its up to me to help turn around his life. Oh, and he's walking  back to my house  because he forgot a can of beer.   I'm pissed now - throw on a robe and wait for him on my back porch - he arrives and I say: "You want my answer?? The honest truth?? I am NOT sacrificing my life for a pot riddled alcoholic." - throw his beer at him and head back into the house.   He proceeds to stand in the middle of the street now - at 3 in the morning, screaming obscenities at my house at the top of his lungs. I had to fight the phone away from my mother because frankly,  I  didn't want to be the reason he goes to jail again. That was another thing - he lied to me about the extent of his criminal record. Truth be said, I was  hoping  my neighbors would call the cops on him, but they didn't.   Needless to say - he went home, passed out for 15 1/2 hours and I had to remind him what happened - and why I was cutting off all contact with him.
I actually talked to some of my fellow coworkers at Frito Lay about this. To reduce the amount of wasted product due to bad top and bottom seals (caused by product being pressed into the seal, due to it not falling to the bottom of the bag), the company decided to make thicker chips to make the weight. Its easier for 8 thick chips to fit into a 1 oz. bag than it is for 12 thin chips to fit in the bag. Likewise, there is less breakage of product when we do this. So yes, there is 1 oz of product there. Everything is weighed.
Throwaway account used because my mum browses this subreddit sometimes.   Today I was supposed to go out with some friends and I wasn't expected to be home till at least 11pm. I meet my friends at around 8pm and we proceeded to go watch a movie together. However during the movie, my best friend started feeling sick and since I live very close to his house, I decided it would be best to drive him home and make sure that everything's okay. So I drove him and then decided to go back home because the movie was almost over at this point and my friends had no plans to go clubbing after the movie since we all have work tomorrow. Note: I am a University student, but I live off campus with my parents as it is cheaper this way.   I let myself quietly home because I thought that my parents and siblings would already be asleep at this time of night (around 10.30pm). However, as I entered my house I realised that my mum is making a phonecall in the bathroom. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but curiosity got the best of me and since she was talking quite loudly, I overheard a part of her conversation.   Long story short, she was talking with her sister (she was calling her by her first name) and at one point she told her how much of a loser I was because I've never been in a relationship before. She continued to say that she's sure that "something's very wrong with me" and how "this isn't normal behaviour of a 20 year old guy". She also said that she doesn't deserve this and she doesn't know what went wrong while I was growing up.   Upon hearing this, I felt devastated. I rushed upstairs into my room and started crying and have been crying for the past hour. I honestly feel like shit because I would have never expected my own mother to talk about me this way. My mum doesn't know how much I'd love to have a girlfriend and how much I try to meet new girls and form a relationship. I have recently been feeling depressed about this and hearing my mum saying what she said has made things ten times worse. I feel like I've not only disappointed myself, but also my mother - as I said, getting into a relationship is a dream of mine, but somehow things don't seem to be working out and regardless of how hard I try, everything fails.   I am also extremely angry at my mother. She should be the one who supports me and accepts me, but it doesn't seem this way. I am planning to talk to her tomorrow about what I heard her say today, but I'm not sure on how I should approach her with regards to this matter. Any advice on how I should handle this situation?
I've posted before but I really need to vent again because tonight I am in such confusion and pain that I can't think straight.   I have been trying to please my girlfriend of 4 months. I have done the best I can by providing for her; giving her my car, a place to stay, paying for her and trying very hard to fill her emotional needs. She suffers from depression and intense trust issues, but I have tried so hard to listen to her and comply with what she asked of me. The effort isn't enough.   She has told me that if she ever sees or finds out that I watch porn, she will leave me. She has told me that I always neglect her and I make her feel unimportant. She has told me that I am a selfish asshole and that I deserve to be alone. She does not believe she is enough, or pretty enough for someone to only want her, and will enrage if I am internet surfing and an ad has a "whore" by accident on the site.   For instance, she checked out Reddit /r/pics and I assume saw a pic of a girl on there and told me if she sees it again she will leave me. She also does, and wanted me to Google parental information on movies before watching them, and if they have nude scenes then she will also leave me. She has told me to fuck off, "I'm not dealing with your shit.", "Today is the last day you will see me.", etc. She constantly hangs up on me if I tell her that I hurt too, or tell her that she is not always the victim (because it is always about me), she constantly threatens to leave me, and today, as she was leaving me for good, told me to drop dead, "I am completely done with you and not dealing with your shit". I am on house arrest (which is why I gave her my car, so she could get around the area) and stormed out in anger, drove my own car away and told me "You can't even leave the house. Fuck off you asshole." "Get someone to pickup your car and never talk to me ever again." or something very close to that effect.   She showed up today unannounced while I was watching a funny movie. (They Came Together) She asked me if I googled it and I said no. That's when immediately stormed out and drove away. I was actually talking to my mom about her when I find out she came back in, stood there listening, and told me "You fucking tell my shit to other people?Go fuck yourself." or something to that effect. In fairness, I HAD told her I would Google movies before I watch them so I would not hurt her and so since I didn't this time, I hurt her and betrayed the little trust she had in me. So yes, I did not comply and I hurt her so I deserved that, I take ownership. So, that validated that I am completely deceptive, untrustworthy and a piece of shit loser.   Also, when she came back in the second time, she told me she read the synopsis that there were tits in the movie and demanded I show her the scene with them. I have no idea what scene or anything. I honestly did not put the movie on to see tits. It just sounded like a really funny movie and I like Paul Rudd.   She is infuriated when I 'deliberately' leave out information when she asks what I am doing, such as what I am watching and at one time 10 minutes went by, she said she had a hard time trusting me that I was organizing my desk drawer.   The past few days she says I have not cared about her or made her feel special. I never once felt like she wasn't the most important girl and friend in my life. I would and did compromise a lot of myself so she could feel at ease and be herself again without fear. After tonight though, I was told to drop dead as she left my house the final time.   I know just as much as you guys have told me that she has major psychological issues. In all honesty I do too because I am hurting so much about this right now. I'm also an alcoholic to boot, but 6 months clean! All I ever wanted to do was make her happy and be our emotional home together. I believe I am now the most hurtful person in the world. I'm not the best boyfriend, I fully admit that. I should have treated her better as most girls deserve that, and paid closer attention to her, because now I believe I deserve to feel this way. I tried so hard to 'comply' as she put, it to her needs but it always somehow ended up with her threatening to leave me.   I know deep down that maybe I don't deserve this treatment from her, but it fucking hurts. I don't know what to do and I am in pain. I don't expect sympathy considering I've done this emotional damage to myself, but damn, how can someone be so cruel? I, personally, could never tell someone "I would rather be alone than with someone like you." It's deliberate and in her eyes, it's justified because I hurt her, whether on purpose or not. I finally snapped and asked how she has fulfilled any of my needs and the response was that she has driven me places.. with my car and the gas money I pay for.   Yes I am crazy and have issues but, fuck, I miss her. When we connected it felt like we understood each other really well, viewed the world similarly, and I can honestly say I connected to her on a deeper level than I have with 99% of people I have met.  ..and now she never wants anything to do with me ever again.   I have never been in an abusive relationship. Is this what it feels like? If so, it is absolute hell. Constant rejection, pain, worthlessness, blame and ultimate dismissal. I am accused, told and viewed as the most uncaring, deceitful, lying person. I feel like she is right and then I feel like I'm not that person. It's a mind fuck and it is driving me insane.   Edit: She drove my car to her house and told me to have someone pick it up. The car keys are under the mat, with the doors unlocked. I also told her I am going to have my mom drop off her Christmas gift when she gets the car because I wanted to get her something regardless of what she thinks of me. The response? "Don't bother. Bye."   Edit 2: After a lot of reflecting tonight, I accepted I can't "fix" her and I have to fix myself first. I have to accept that she is going to be hurting, for whatever the reason, and there is nothing I can do. It sucks and I sacrificed a lot of what I enjoy only to end up as the hurtful man. I want her to be happy again and see how wonderful a person she is underneath those chaotic layers.   I know I don't, or anyone, deserves to be treated like this, but maybe someone who has been where I am can give some advice or share their experience?  It has almost been the most confusing, loving, excruciating, and chaotic experience. I literally felt like I was becoming someone I am not at times, just so she could see how much she meant to me. I am somehow hurt as hell right now. Logic isn't helping.
What happened here is the calf stopped running away, so the lion didn't know how to interpret the calf. Prey runs away, but this calf wasn't running so the lion was confused, he tried to bat it with it's paw to make it scared. The confusing part is why the lion starts to nurture the pray, as has been documented many times.
I'll probably get downvoted like I always do when I mention this, but I don't use cannabis any more because it caused in me (and has others) a kind of instant and long lasting pyschosis/severe anxiety/panic to the extent of nervous breakdown. Granted I did too much when this happened, and granted this only seems to happen to a small percent of people that are susceptible, but it is extremely damaging to one's psyche. I'd compare the impact on the mind to what happens to the body after getting mauled to within an inch of one's life in a car accident. To those thinking it may was adulterated, I was in complete control of the plant from the time of it's sprouting. For this reason, I don't recommend using it if you have a history of mental issues, especially anxiety or panic disorders. This is one more reason it should be legal, so that scientists can have open access and do controlled studies more easily. This is a real thing, and should be studied and documented as such, so that the populace can be informed.  Edit:
That is what gets me the most. It isn't that they didn't know about these problems. They knew all of them, decided to go with Qatar, then went, sorry people, turns out Qatar is fucking hot in the summer, so we might have to move it to winter or think of some other solution.   Really? Qatar is hot in the summer? Children know the Arabia area is hot in the summer you jackasses and so did you. But you went with it anyways before thinking of concrete solutions. These problems weren't some unforeseeable problems they had to look into the FIFA crystal ball to find.
I was just having a conversation with someone about net neutrality where I pointed out that if it doesn't happen and onerous restrictions come about that:   The internet phenomenon cannot be stopped.   We'll go wireless.  Well go microwave.  We'll use frickin lazers (LOS).   There are open cores, open bioses, open os's, open chipsets, and people like us (OSS and Open Hardware developers) who are passionate about our work.  You can't stop bright minds from innovating and using their own time to create things and give them away.   The people that brought all these things to existence in cumulation represent an unstoppable force.   Just look at 802.11a/b.  FCC sat on it's ass and didn't allocate freqs for high speed wireless, so intuitive people said fuck it, we'll do it on the freqs for cordless phones.   Information wants to be free, and we want the freedom to communicate in the way we choose and on the mediums we choose.  It's human nature.   EDIT:
Hey all, I'm new here, so be gentle.   I don't know if there's been a lot of discussion about this, but I looked around this thread, and some relationship ones, and couldn't find it. I'm 29, female, African American, and living in a Changsha in China. I've been here for about 3 years. My Mandarin is poor to middling.   Full disclosure: I'm am overweight, but I am working on that. I've lost about 40 lbs since I came here, and am still working out several times a week, butenoughaboutthat...   I want a Chinese boyfriend. I definitely have a thing for Chinese guys, and I would love to end up with one. But a few things are standing in my way. 1) I don't go out much, I don't drink or go bar hopping, and I don't know that many available guys my age. 2) This year I may be leaving China for a while, and once I come back I'll have a job that's going to require that I (and my SO) move every few years. But, I want to give it a try.   I know most of you are guys, and it's possible that you have Chinese guy friends (if you're living over here). So, I'm throwing myself at your mercy. Other than 1) Getting in better shape and 2) Learning more Mandarin, what can I do to be more active in finding a bf? Being an American, and speaking English makes me a bit more popular, but being black doesn't help.   I just figure out of over half a billion people I should be able to find someone.
Not sure why people take him so seriously. He's a funny guy that's playing an egotistical and hilarious character, however at the same time he is legit when it comes to games. Maybe not the very best he always claims to be, but he is certainly no average scrub.   He is honest with his words though: In one of his challenges he challenged anyone to beat 3 insane (or was it 4) difficulty AI in SC2, with a reward of $1000 (USD?) for the first one to do a legit attempt. In layman terms, a very very difficult task unless you had some trick up your sleeve. A redditor in /r/starcraft was the first to do and was paid $1000.
At least when someone goes from cancer/other prolonged chronic illness, there's sort of a "Well, we did all we could do" feeling to it. Even if they die because they chose to discontinue treatment, there's the consolation that it was their time, that they were in constant agony but now they're in a better place. They went on their own terms, and were ready to go. When they pass, they were most likely surrounded by the people they love.   Suicide isn't anything like that. No matter how many people are around him, he will die alone. Absolutely, and totally, alone. People who kill themselves don't make that final choice because they're ready. They make that choice because for them, at that moment, the one thing worse than dying is pretending to want to live. In that respect, it really isn't that much different from someone who wants to stop treatment for cancer. However, for cancer there are stuffed bears and ribbons and TV specials and movies and church pamphlets and seeing someone suffer in front of you to make you understand why it hurts and why they end up making that choice. There's usually a nice bit of time to deal with that fact, too. Time for one last Thanksgiving or game of golf or night at the movies. When suicide happens, you have to deal with all of those things at the same time. Instead of being able to appreciate your last poker night with a best friend, you have to regret for the rest of your life that you spent the whole evening pissed at him because he cheated you out of seven dollars on the second draw. With cancer, there are a million things you can do to prevent it or help a friend who has it come through or keep comfortable. With suicide, you never had a chance to do one of the million things to help because you never knew to look. A death from cancer leaves thoughts of love and sadness and grief behind. Suicide leaves shock and regrets and what-ifs at its wake. Cancer leaves you thinking about someone else. Suicide leaves you thinking about yourself.
I'm speaking strictly for use in automatic coffee makers. Cone filters were invented for the pourover style of coffee making and mainly used in Europe until the 80s. I remember being a kid in Sweden and this is how we made coffee with a kettle, pot, and filter by manually pouring it over using various techniques. I think the shape was supposed to encourage a "plug" of sediment or such and affect the flow rate. Cut to the 70s and Americans had the drip coffee revolution with Mr. Coffee and by the 80s it was the norm and percolated coffee was out. So by the 80s, basket drip coffee makers were the norm and needed something to distinguish themselves with and started to adopt the cone shaped European filter. This was a marketing move. I figure it's hard to hype up an accurate thermostat or other invisible improvement compared to a useless visual one like "hey, our filter is fancier and more expensive and  European . It doesn't make sense, as a drip coffee maker's flow is slowed down mainly by the rate of dripping.   Another argument can be made against the cone filter as it promotes using a fine grind and over extraction of the coffee.   Finally, if it was superior, then why do commercial drip coffee makers use flat bottomed basket filters?
Last year my father bought a 47" HDTV because his friend had a good deal for him. Before this, we had a 27" CRT.   I hooked up the PS3 to the new TV with the HDMI  and  the analogue cables because I didn't realise that the HDMI alone was sufficient enough. The output was actually 540p but because the image was blown up into huge proportions, my brother and I oohed and aahed at the wonders of a HDTV. We exclaimed how the picture quality was simply amazing for a whole two weeks. One day I decided to play around with the image settings on the PS3 and wondered what 1080p was. Loaded up MGS4. OMG. My mind was blown. It was like Christmas again.
So every weapon at Hasla costs 150 tokens (tier 1) most of them are 2H weapons which means that if you need a great sword and a bow (tier 1) you need 300 tokens to get them both, but as soon as you want to dual wield or have a sword and a shield then things get a little more complicated since you might also want a bow - and now that honor tokens drop a bit more than the other ones do but this is still a crazy.   And all of that is just tier one, which is the lowest if some of you don't know that already. So here we come to my suggestion(s)     Do so 1 handed weapons (sword, shield and mace(i think)) only cost half the tokens - 75 - this would make it more fair for many classes!     Create a quest that you can spam - something like this: Kill X amour of monsters for X amount of coins, lets say the number is 150 so you get 150 tokens for those kills - if this is too much we can simply make it so 150 mobs killed gives you 75 tokens OF YOUR CHOICE  this would make it way easier for people to get weapons that they need.       What do you guys think of this idea, also the labor cost of crafting the weapon is HUGE for people without Patron - before i got patron the highest amour of labor i got on was 300 (weapons need 500)
I started playing Brave Frontier near the end of last year, but unfortunately I quit due to the lack of people I knew playing the game; this all ended when I stumbled across this subreddit, and the wonderful community that it contained! Even though I remained a lurker on this subreddit for the longest time, it was the best thing for me; people here joke and hype about every little thing that is released or going to be in the future (looking at you Maxwell,) and I just had to start playing again so I could be a part of that. I can come here for whatever reason, and will always have a laugh or find answers to questions I have (or even answers to questions I never knew I had).   So, I wanted to take the time to thank everyone for everything they have done; this fantastic community (even you Nazta ;3) has been so amazing; the never-ending advice from seasoned players like Formana, the jaw-dropping fan art from all sources, and even the occasional "plot" jokes makes me feel like the hype train will never end. And of course, thanks most of all to the wonderful mods (with each bringing their own unique flavor to this place,) as well as the Slime Crew (turn up the HYPE CKlandSHARK!!!). This subreddit would not be the same without all of you, and Twofu's dictatorship helps to make this all a reality (just kidding Twofu, you are an amazing admin ily <3). Honestly, all of you are great and deserve medals for your hard work! :D
We all know this, we enjoy a nice stream of one of our favourite streamers and someone appears that seems to be a troll. Some of then are trolls indeed, others are just voicing their opinion in a weird way, others have straight forward bad manners.   What happens? People react to the trollish person because they feel - for what reason so ever - offended. While this happens other people start reacting to the people that reacted to the troll.   At this point we get where at least every third post in chat is about the troll and people start feeling lost because they get annoyed by the troll. The people that react to the troll and some of them get annoyed because the mods appear to not ban that trollish person fast enough or don't participate in the talk with the troll.   The sad truth is: Every visitor that participated so far in this discussion didn't only potentially feed the troll, they also missed the chance to have a nice chat experience.   Wouldn't it be more fun to ignore the troll and just keep talking about what's actually happening on stream? I bet it would also be much nicer for the streamer himself if people would keep being focussed on him and the discussions he encourages instead of what the potential troll did to chat.   So yeah, that's the story. Let's say that guy was a troll, who feed him so far?     The guys reacting to him.   The guys reacting to the people that reacted to him.   The people that asked mods to ban him.     Also in case a mod does ban that guy the story doesn't end. People say "Thank you mod!" or "Finally!". Well, it sure was nice of the mod to interfere and clean the chat. But if the troll really was a troll messages like "Thank you!" and "Finally!" doesn't make him unhappy. Worst case scenario is that you just encourage the troll to make a new account.
I just upgraded from my 3570k's stock cooler to a [212 Evo]( and it's pretty nice. My CPU is noticeably cooler.   Then I decided to go out and buy an [extra fan]( mostly because it just sort of seemed like the thing to do. Even though my processor doesn't get as hot as it used to under load, I still see it hit 40C sometimes under low-intensity conditions when my room is hot, so I was gonna put it on the other side of the 212's heat sinks, since it can support a second fan.   Then I wondered if I might be better off mounting it on the chassis instead? That 40° probably isn't much to worry about anyway, even though I'd like it to stay below 30. So maybe if I make it blow at my GPU (HD 7870), it will keep that cooler. For some reason it's sitting at 40°C right now as I'm writing this. Why? I dunno, but it's hot.   So my question is this: Where will I get the most benefit from mounting this monster fan? (guy at the shop says it "moves a shit-ton of air," which is right - 50% more than the others I was looking at). Do I put it on the [other side of my CPU cooler? Or on the chassis pointing at (or away? I don't know what's good) my graphics card?]( Or maybe on the [other mount point on the side of my case?]( Perhaps on the [bottom]( or the [top]( And no matter which point it winds up being on, what direction do I want it to blow?
My only vape experience is with the Volcano I've had for 6 years. I'm going to Vail to ski this week and I figured an oil pen was the safest option for the slopes out there. Is there any advice you'll can give me on the type of pen (cheap or not) that I should go out and get. Is that something I should get locally or wait until I fly out to Colorado.   I'm about to look through the great resources in this post, so I apologize if any of my questions ends up being redundant.   Edit:
When i was 20 years old i was infatuated with a girl from work. She liked me too but held back for some reason or another. I wooed her for about a year before she finally would date me. Even at this point i still wasnt getting laid (not a virgin). She toyed with my emotions the whole time i was trying to date her my disdain for the whole situation built up for a long time. I went out with a friend drinking and we met up with a few girls that were really into us and 1 ended up trying to get me into bed with her. I almost did it but i decided against it at the last moment and went home and evaluated the situation. After some thought i decided that in the same situation she would have probably fucked they guy. I broke up with her the next day.. her Birthday. I found out later that day that her grandfather had passed in the night and she was waiting to talk to me all morning.
I've been to a few hardcore shows and one big punk show (Screeching Weasel in Denver) and the punk crowd was hands down way more fun to be in. I got thrown around a shit ton at the Screeching Weasel show but it was all in good fun, and whenever somebody would go down, they would immediately be rescued by one of the many sweaty and drunken punks in the pit. I've never seen people look out for each other like that at a hardcore show. Rather they tend to be full of 16-19 year old douche bags with serious anger issues who believe that they are much more badass than they actually are.
For everyone recommending Fate/Zero, let me offer a counter opinion. I watched Fate/Zero first and I regret it. From /u/Lorpius_Prime :   Sigh. Okay, so first up, there's not anything horribly wrong with watching Fate/Zero first. It's a great story, and it will give you a deeper understanding of what's going on in Fate/Stay Night right from the beginning. But there is a reason that many people--including myself--will tell you that it's not the ideal place to begin the series, that it's a better experience to play FSN first and then watch F/Z as a prequel. The problem we have with your conclusion is that you're making it after playing only the first route of the VN. Fate does not stand alone as a complete work, it is only the first portion of a three-part (at least) story. FSN dribbles out its information slowly, so that information you learn in subsequent routes offers new insight into previous events. This culminates in the events and conclusion of the finale route, which are meant to entirely change your perspective of the first two: what you once thought was a satisfactory, if bittersweet, ending may begin to appear unpleasant and even disturbing as you learn the truth of what was really going on. Fate/Zero changes that experience. Again, not in a way that's necessarily bad, but certainly different than it originally worked. If you played FSN first, then the joy of F/Z is in seeing the fleshed out version of a story that you knew occurred, but whose full nature you'd only had vague hints of. Knowing how it all ends also sharpens some of the tragedy; and changes which parts of the story are twists (e.g., F/Z spoilers[1] ). It's not unlike the situation with Star Wars post-prequels. Watching that film series chronologically isn't wrong or even really bad, but it is a fundamentally different journey through the story which alters the viewer's perceptions of and reactions to critical moments.
Maybe I'm a late bloomer. I always liked the idea of finding love, but I never found a guy that I thought would be worth dating.  This year I did, and we dated for 6 months.  I know it's not that long, but this was the first time I've been in a relationship. It was also the first time I fell in love.   It felt like we were family. I knew what he was thinking without him having to say anything, and we played and laughed like little kids when we were together. I really loved him, and he knew how much I adored him.   But he never let me feel secure in the relationship.  Though we were official fairly soon after our first date, he took about 5 months to say he liked me. It was as if just saying that was a huge step for him. I know he cared about me, but I also felt his doubt about our relationship.   Around month 6, I found out that he was moving. I told him that I'd do long distance, but he refused. It was a hard conversation, and we both cried like babies. We agreed to stay together until he had to move, but it was terrible. He started pulling away, and I started feeling desperate.   I tried to coerce him into doing fancy dinner dates, and to meet my parents. That totally backfired, and only escalated the timing of our breakup. After inviting him to come home with me for the weekend, he finally said that he might be able to come to meet my parents. But he flaked. He didn't even call to say that he wouldn't be coming, and it was gut wrenching to walk in to my parent's house without him.  That was what caused me to break it off before he moved.   We treated each other with kindness during the breakup, and he even spent two or three hours with me while I tried to figure out why things couldn’t work.  I still don’t understand why actually. I don’t know why he couldn’t give me an honest chance to be with him.  He never let me in. Whenever he mentioned one of his interests or hobbies, it would be like pulling teeth to get him to share details with me. After breaking up, I started taking up his hobbies to find out for myself, and now I feel even more angry! I genuinely enjoy these things as well, and we could have enjoyed them together if he tried sharing it with me!   It’s been 101 days since I last saw him, and I’m still a mess.  The crying has lessened to only a few times a week, but this is ridiculous. I’m FANTASTIC! And he’s being a moron!   So here’s my question: What do I do?   I can’t go over this. I’m not lonely, and my life is filled with joy from friends, family, and my many projects.  I’m not looking for a guy to make me happy. I just want this one person to feel about me the way that I feel about him.
I'm 21 years old, ACoND. I'm leaving for graduate school in about a week, and I've been getting a bunch of paperwork and stuff taken care of before I move. I just filled out a medical power of attorney today, and I would HIGHLY recommend everyone here (and everywhere else, for that matter) has one filled out.   It's very important to have one these filled out, in case you are ever in an emergency or an accident, and you're ever unable to communicate to doctors or nurses.   You can appoint an agent to act on your behalf and make decisions according to their assessment of your values.  It does NOT have to be a family member , if you don't want it to be. You can make notes of whether or not you are interested in organ donation, donating your body to science, if you want to be kept alive or you don't want to be resuscitated, etc. Also, an important thing for this subreddit is that  you can provide rules and instructions for your visitation . If you have an N-family member, and you don't want them to be present for visits or involved with decisions about your life, then write that down in the document, and they will honor it.   My mom is an ICU nurse, and she has been doing that job for longer than I've been alive. She's told me countless sad stories of patients that are sick like that, and the families come in and argue and bicker about what to do, and it's just an unpleasant experience for everyone. It's a shame that families have to act like that in front of dying relatives, but it happens. And all of that can be avoided by filling out one of these forms.   I'm not a lawyer or anything, but it's my understanding that it's common practice for both parents to be notified about an emergency, and if they can't be located, then they'll look for siblings, kids, aunts/uncles, etc. If there are people that fall into any of these categories, and you decide you don't want them involved, then make it known in that document. If you don't have it filled out, then it is up to the state to decide what to do about your body, your end-of-life care, and your visitors. And it is highly unlikely that they will consider anything about N-behavior amongst family members.   In Virginia, it's called an [advance healthcare directive]( which is essentially the same thing as a power of attorney. Can't speak for other states, but in Virginia, this document does not need to be notarized or written by a lawyer. You just have to have two witnesses observe you signing it. [This link]( provides links for each individual state's  documents about this.   My advice would be to keep one copy for yourself, give one to the person(s) you appoint as your agent, and give one copy to your doctor's office, so they can keep it with your medical records.   Again, I can't stress this enough, it is important for  everyone  to have one of these filled out, so that your voice can be heard, even when you are unable to speak. This is how you make that happen. It takes a few minutes to fill out, it's free (or very inexpensive), no lawyers are needed, and you can specify any directions about your body, your moral values, your treatments, and even your visitors. Please fill one of these out. It could save you a LOT of trouble and drama down the road, if you are ever in an accident or something. Please be prepared, because I would hate to see some bad N-behavior come forward during a time of medical emergency like this. And it happens more often than you might believe. Please prevent that for yourself, and fill out one of these documents.   I will close with [another link]( that provides more information and resources about this kind of stuff. It is a very helpful website, and they're the founders of National Healthcare Decisions Day, which is an initiative that is designed to get people to think about this stuff and make their decisions and voices known. The main reason I keep linking to this site, is because my mom knows the lawyer that founded this organization, and it is a noble and very important cause.
Analysis   All the raw number changes are below this analysis.   I'll work to add more data to this post and update my weapon spreadsheet with time.  For now I just want the basic information to be posted.   Tapping, Bursting, and Spraying   As explained in [Valve's blog post]( the way shooting accuracy is handled for the AK47, M4A1-S, and M4A4 have been altered.   This was achieved by altering the rate at which inaccuracy from firing decays depending on how many bullets have been fired.   All three guns seem to follow the same pattern.  The first 3 bullets use the faster inaccuracy decay rate.  Bullets 4, 5, and 6 all get progressively slower decay rates.  From 6 onward, the decay rate doesn't get any worse.  Looking at the raw data below, you'll see the decay rate for tapping and bursting is about 20% less and spraying is about 10% more.   The graphs Valve made due a great job summarizing all of this into something easy to digest.   [AK-47 when tapping](   [AK-47 when spraying](   In short: Tapping and bursting are more accurate now and spraying is less accurate.  In the case of the AK-47, spraying has about 8% more inaccuracy present.   Recoil Changes   In addition to inaccuracy, recoil (what pulls your shots upward) has also been reworked.   This change isn't exclusive to the 3 rifles that had their accuracy altered.  It applies to ALL guns.   Recoil was reworked to reset faster if only one or a few bullets were fired.  It resets slower after spraying. This improves tapping even more for rifles, and even improves tapping for all guns (but to a lesser degree than the 3 rifles due to the lack of accuracy changes).   There's currently a bug in place where reloading won't count as time waited after firing and the recoil pattern is altered because of this.  [ ido_valve post ](   Edit: The reload bug has been fixed as of the 5th of August.   M4 Crouching Nerf   The M4A4 and M4A1-S (silenced and unsilenced) had their base crouching accuracy reduced.   M4A4 and unsilenced M4A1-S: 4.28 -> 4.70   M4A1-S  4.18 -> 4.60   The other accuracy and recoil changes negate this somewhat.  Rapid tapping and burst fire when crouched will still be more accurate with this update, though slow tapping when crouched will be worse.   Jumping Accuracy Increased   This is a side effect of changing the way inaccuracy decay works.  When airborne, RecoveryTimeCrouch * 4 is used as the decay rate. Recovery time crouch final is not used while airborne even if many bullets are fired.  Here's some comparisons:         Pre-Update   Post-Update           AK-47   146.47   128.31       M4A4   101.12   85.69       M4A1-S   103.41   87.59           This update is a really nice first step towards encouraging tap and burst fire over spraying.  Give Valve some feedback over the next few weeks!
I was going to post this after work last night but I wanted to get some sleep. Yesterday I finally did it. I told my mother I was bisexual and I was relieved when she was okay with it. It felt so great to finally get that off my chest. She always told me that she would love me no matter what but I always had my doubts but I was happy to find out that she kept her word.   Here is where the hero part comes in. As some of you may know I work at a grocery store and part of my job is bringing in carts from the cart corrals in the parking lot. I was bringing in corrals when I see this guy acting suspiciously. I think nothing of it until I hear cop sirens and see the man sprint into a two foot wide alley between the store and a kiosk we had outside. Four cop cars come up and drive by. One car stops and the driver goes inside the store. I take the group of carts I had inside and go to talk to my manager. I tell my manager what I saw and he passed it onto the cop. The cop radios his back up, they go outside and grab the guy. Had I not spoken up the guy probably would've gotten away because the cops were about to go search a different area.
I don't know anyone who doesn't like this (as it seems to be an issue in soccer/football), it doesn't usually slow the game down and aren't frusterated with a bad goal call.   I think the issue at hand regarding this is that it doesn't slow the game of hockey down since it's a game that's already used to taking multiple-minute breaks for TV timeouts and such, so another one or two per game is no big deal.   In soccer, the only time that the game officially stops (barring unforeseen circumstances such as a freak-ass blizzard, lightning striking near the stadium, etc), is at the half and at the end.  So the opponents of goal-line tech are concerned that you're going to see that change and that there will be several minutes of review time after any questionable goal.  What they don't realize is that the VAST majority of goals in soccer aren't even close to being questionable, and that on those that need review, the technology is so good that the ref will have an answer within seconds.
Last night I got wasted with my friends... After having a few beers and some vodka, our inhibitions were lowered enough that words started to come between us.   Long story short, I yelled at my friends to shut the fuck up 7 times from 4-6 in the morning. They were really agitating me, needless to say I was being an ass too  They're the kind of people who reach a certain point of intoxication where they somehow think it's okay to continually run their mouth about shit. Left them and crashed out because I was getting exceeding aggressive and angry, words were being exchanged and I believed fists were the next step.   Now I'm awake and stuck at his house until I can get a ride home (don't have a car, too far to walk). Awkward.
I hope SOPA Passes so people will get radicalized and make  real  change!"   "I hope a republican gets elected so people will get radicalized and make  real  change!"   "I hope the US suspends habeas corpus and institutes a police state, because then people will get radicalized and make  real  change!"   "I wish the US was more like Egypt/Libya/etc -- those were  real  protests!"   Honestly whenever I see these kinds of sentiments I can't help thinking that the speaker wants radicalization as an  end in itself , rather than actually trying to improve our society.   The only way in my opinion to make real, lasting change, is to educate and change the opinion of the populace as a whole over time. This is a  slow process . The radical minority can scream as loud as they want, but that's not going to change most people's minds.   And what's with the dig against recycling? That doesn't really seem to fit, and I'm not sure where he gets his 3% figure from.
I am a manager at a steakhouse. My GM and I began talking about this new game Destiny coming out a few months ago. We made our purchases and began our fight against the darkness. We fought side by side much of the way. Battling the fallen, hive, cabal, and vex every step of the way. Hundreds of hours and many Vault of Glass clears later, here we are. December 9th is upon us. Now, December had cut my play time severely. We work 6 days, some times over 12 hours a day. Needless to say, its busy. I was worried I wouldn't be able to enjoy The Dark Below on Day 1.Yet, low and behold, both myself and my boss are off. Thank you Space Jesus and may the Light be with you.
Sorry for the generic title, didn't want to include any spoilers.   After Episode 10 it seems like the Sub is split on whether Stannis is actually dead in the show or not. I am going to outline some reasons why I believe why Stannis is still alive and where he will go from here.   First, it's important to establish some facts based on what was shown in this episode:     Initially we find that the snows are melting and Shireen's burning may have actually worked. At the very least, it seems to have granted Stannis a reprieve from the harsh weather.     Melisandre enters Stannis' camp and tells him that the path is clear to Winterfell. He says that they will march to Winterfell. Melisandre responds and says that he will take it. Stannis doesn't acknowledge this comment, but rather looks away and the camera pans on his face as if he is hiding something.     Melisandre says she saw Bolton banners burning in her flames. Now we know that Melisandre is notorious for getting the visions right but the interpretation wrong. Once again we see the camera pan on a cryptic Stannis face.     Stannis leaves his camp and is informed that all of the sellswords have left with his horses. Now Stannis is a seasoned battle commander, and he has to know that any battle with no horses would be incredibly one-sided if the Boltons deployed from Winterfell.     When another man approaches Stannis about informing him of Selyse Stannis has the wherewithal to jape, in spite of the massive blow his army has suffered, when he says. "Speak. Whatever it is it can't be worse than mutiny." It could just be that he's cool under pressure, but maybe he's cooking up something he doesn't want anyone else to know.     Stannis marches, which attracts Pod's attention who alerts Brienne. She leaves to fight figuring that since Sansa hasn't lit the candle she might as well get Stannis while she can.     Stannis sees the opposing Bolton forces coming at him, clearly outnumbering his remaining arm and with a huge strategic advantage, yet still pops a smile and brandishes his sword. Somehow manages to stay alive (Shireen blood magic?).       And now we get to the part with Brienne. Brienne introduces herself to Stannis, explains her reason for being there, and gets Stannis to confess to killing Renly with blood magic. She decides to sentence Stannis to death, and for his last words he says, "Do your duty."   The following part is key because the camera focuses on Brienne as we see her face flicker from determination to uncertainty. Perhaps even with realization when you consider what "do your duty" means to Brienne. She swore a vow to avenge Renly, but her most important responsibility, what she has been doing for several months now, is to find Arya (and then Sansa).   It's important to note that Pod is not with Brienne. This is oddly out of character considering most if not all of the scenes Brienne is in she is joined by Pod. What would be so important as for her to send him away?   Given these details, I believe that there are two scenarios which would make it so that Stannis may be alive.     Brienne recognizes that her duty is not to hold on to revenge but rather to protect Sansa, and she just swings her sword in rage.     Pod either: sees the candle lit in the tower, sees Sansa and Theon fall from the Winterfell battlements, and/or is able to save Sansa and Theon and brings them to Brienne just before she kills Stannis. This causes her to stop and realize that her real responsibility is to protect Sansa.       I think #2 is clearly more likely than #1. In the case of option 2, Stannis can also explain his decision to reclaim the Dreadfort, and may convince Brienne that it may be the safest place to get Sansa (at the very least as a launching place to get to the Wall).   Also, the fact that Stannis' death is not explicitly shown should cast some doubt. The scene instead cuts away to Ramsay killing someone which I believe is meant to juxtapose Brienne with Ramsay's wanton killing of those who are not fit to fight anymore.   Thus, I believe that Stannis is still alive. In addition, I think he made it look like he was crushed at Winterfell to obscure his real objective: the Dreadfort. This was brought up recently as a theory that was originally created by /u/cantuse, where he hypothesized that Stannis sent a mobile contingent of his forces to take the Dreadfort while the Boltons were expecting a full assault at Winterfell.   There is textual support for Stannis making it seem like he will be defeated at the Battle for Winterfell. Take for example this quote from the Theon sample chapter from TWOW:   >"It may be that we shall lose this battle," the king said grimly. "In Braavos you may hear that I am dead. It may even be true. You shall find my sellswords nonetheless." (Theon, TWOW)
I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you that having one leg shorter than the other (especially by an inch) won't be nearly as bad as you'd think. A friend of mine has one leg about 6" shorter than the other, and it has had no bearing whatsoever on her life. She just wears a shoe with a compensating attachment at the bottom and it's okay. Barely even limps. And that's her entire leg, not just the femur.
Very true, and also the way your FoV changes at high speed. I heard it described very well a few weeks back on this sub, essentially your view is stretched and motion blur is added at high speed to make it appear as if you're moving at super sports car speeds. In reality, you're not moving as fast as ~150 mph would look in real life, as far as how fast you pass by objects. A lot of the feeling of legitimate speed in-game is done by fancy viewpoint trickery. So if the speedometer says 150, you might be passing objects at what maybe 100 mph would look like, due to the restrictions on rendering objects at high speed, the scale of the game world in pure miles, etc.
Everything about people like that upsets me.   My junior year of high school, I dated a girl like that. I didn't know that she cheated on me with (and lost her virginity to) some ~25-year-old guy when she went to visit her older sister in another state when I broke up with her. I learned that a few months later (On my 18th birthday actually. That was awesome). So I figure, whatever, who gives a shit, we're not together anymore. So I start dating this other girl, and my ex comes into the picture, and says, "Yeah, LHodge is terrible. He lied to me for our whole relationship, and he cheated on me, with my best friend." Too bad neither of those things happened at all. So the new girlfriend and I start having problems, and start fighting 24/7, and break up. I'm pissed, start telling mutual friends (of myself and the first ex) about what happened, and that she cheated. So she tells everyone that I cheated on her, and I'm lying to make myself look better, then tells the dean of students that I'm harassing her, and that I  threatened to murder her . In the end, we had to have a face-to-face with each other and the dean of students, and she said she refused to talk about when we were dating (presumably so that she wouldn't be embarrassed by the fact that she slept with a man about 10 years her senior while she was in high school and had a boyfriend). Anyway, I didn't give in to her demands, talked about it anyway, made her cry and she FINALLY admitted she was lying, after I produced physical evidence of all of my recent talks with her, and all of her recent talks with anyone I knew, which proved to the dean that she was not only harassing me, but also lying about everything. However, to this day, she still maintains that  I  cheated on  her , two years later. Oh well, at least I got to figuratively bitch slap her for trying to charge me with harassment, assault, and conspiracy to commit a crime (which almost got me kicked out of various service organizations I was a part of, and almost cost me a $22,000/year scholarship to the college I attend), by threatening her with the same, and apparently being the reason that she has no more friends.
I would never use that for anything more then a dirt bike. Even then, you're still putting a lot of weight on the tongue.   When towing with my car (04 Golf TDI) I pull a [Kendon]( trailer.   Between the bike/trailer its about 750lbs + gear which is well within the [GVWR]( which a lot of people don't take into account when towing/hauling.   I read a pretty in depth article a while back about towing and how insurance companies love to deny claims for accidents which are a result of improper towing/overloading their vehicle because they don't understand what the different ratings actually mean/imply.
My boyfriend and I have been living with our roommate since August. She's a friend I've known for 2 years and is a pretty cool person. We all get along good and haven't ever had any problems until now.   My roommate's half brother needed a place to crash. My boyfriend and I didn't have any problems and assumed it would only be for a few nights. Maybe a week at the very most. He's stayed the night before and we were told he'd often stay a night or two every once in a while. Well, a month and a half later, he and his barely 18 year old girlfriend are both "staying" on our couch.   Some of the things they do that really make me want them out:     Eat my food that I buy without them asking.    Use my stuff (especially personal bathroom products) without asking.   Crank the heat up and leave lights, TV, and every other electrical appliance on.    Swear, hit, and are disrespectful to each other in front of not only my 4 year old, but also my roommate's child.    Don't clean up after themselves. There's a week's worth of their dirty dishes  PILED  in the sink (very few of them are my kid's, boyfriend's, or mine).    Have  VERY LOUD  sex in the bathroom when the kids are home.    Sleep all day after partying all night (not at our home any more, thankfully).   Turn up the volume on the TV in the living room (their "room") so loud my kiddo can't sleep at night.   Fail to help pay bills and food.    When locked out of the house they pound on the door and try to break in.     The brother is 27. More than old enough to be a fully productive member of society. He just chooses not to. He'd much rather drink and do drugs than get a job and his own place. The barely legal girlfriend just showed up with him one day...and hasn't left. She doesn't have a job either and is a high school drop out. Supposedly she's attempting to get her GED. I've caught her trying to "hack" into our wifi and get pissed when she can't.   I'm a pretty laid back and understanding person. I value and cherish family and know how important they are to have in your life. But this is ridiculous. The brother is  CLEARLY  taking advantage of his sister (and my boyfriend and mine's)  money, food, electriciy  hospitality. I've talked to her about her brother and the girlfriend, but the only thing she said to me was that he's "only clean when he's staying here." Honestly, I'm scared to death for my child's and my safety when they're here. I don't know how else to go about telling my roommate that her freeloading brother and his white trash girlfriend need to find somewhere else to go. Any suggestions???
First ever post...please bear with me.  Background information:  I met "B" online through a bizarre social experiment my friends and i designed to score me a date to a George Strait concert.  We placed an "ad" to go on a date with me, no strings attached.  We placed the ad on various media outlets and asked guys to respond with an email saying why we should pick them.   .   Well, B sends in an email.  I respond.  The rest is history.  We talked online for over a month and met in person, officially, at the end of March.  Things are awesome.  I start to fall for him even more...and vice versa.  Keep in mind, he is a contract civilian overseas working a 30 day here/there rotation.  He is also divorced, 2 small kids, and a crazy lazy ex-wife. .   Things get better:  I'm a very laid back person when it comes to relationships.  I was crazy supportive of his life and we worked around his schedule (work, kids, etc.).   .   Fast forward to mid October:  He TEXTS me while he's overseas (yes, he can call, we talk all the time) and says he hates to do this but he needs to focus on his kids and he doesn't have time to be with me and be with them.  It's killing him, blah blah blah, he still loves me, blah, blah, blah.  So the next 2 weeks go by just like nothing is changed.  We communicate all day everyday just like we have been for the last 7-8 months.  He flies back and i see him for a little over and hour and he leaves to go have lunch with his kids at their school.   .   He's been home for 3 weeks now and i haven't seen him since i picked him up at the airport.  So if you don't count the 1.5 hours he was at my house, i haven't physically been around him in 8 weeks due to this rotation.   .   He did a 180 and it's like pulling teeth to even get him to text me back.  Literally, it's like a light switch to night and day of what we had.  He tells me that he's sorry all the time.  He just needs time.  He needs a friend.  yet, he's not being a friend to me.  I won't hear from him for a couple days.  He won't come get his stuff that is still at my house.   .   and now, he told me at the beginning of the week that he quit his job.  I think he is self-destructing.  He's doing intentional things to make his life harder than what it has to be.  When we were together, it was so good.  We didn't fight.  We are really compatible.   .   I'm not making contact with him and haven't talked in a couple of days.  He knows i'm here for him and want to be his support.  He's breaking my heart.  the last time i spoke to him, i told him that he is actively choosing to do this alone and he doesn't have to.   .   What do i do?  Cut him loose and run like the wind?  Just let him come to me?  (i also need his stuff out of my house.) .   . edited: for visibility and spacing   .
I work at a pretty well known general contractor. I'm 20 and have been working there for 3 1/2 years now. For the past 6 months I've been helping fill in in the accounting department while someone was on leave. They chose me because they know I'm studying accounting in school and that's going to be my major. I liked what I got to do in accounting and the days went by fast. The CFO treated me amazingly well. I got multiple bonuses and a raise while working for her. I made some really good friends back there too. The only part I didn't like was working with 6 other women in a small area. Don't get me wrong I don't have a problem with women in the workplace but it's just not very fun for a 20 year old guy when we don't really relate on most levels. Plus I can't bother with all the catty shit that they involve themselves with. It's as if they're still in high school with all the drama they associate themselves with and it bugs the hell out of me.   Before that I worked in the property management department for nearly a year. I liked the work because it was challenging and very satisfying once a job was completed. I liked the people I worked with but was not as close with them as I am with my friends in accounting. I've been pretty much on my own in property management though. Whenever I have a question my boss usually tells me he doesn't have the time to answer so I'm left to answer a question by myself that takes me two days to find out when he knows the answer right away. Also I had to fight for a pay raise and have never gotten a bonus for any of the jobs I've completed. So the CFO in accounting recognizes my hard work more than he does.   I'm lost at this point. There's ups and downs to both sides. At least I like the work in both right?
Guys   So here's what happened.   My friend left his pack of cigarettes with me the previous night and while checking out the next day, I leave the pack at the hotel, intentionally, since I did not want to carry it with me ( I quit a while back).   My friend lived in another room and he smoked outside, while I was with him and then came over to my room- we spoke a while and he left and forgot his pack of cigarettes. I wake up next morning, pack my bag, see the pack of cigarettes, leave it behind and leave the hotel   The hotel now charges me 250$ smoking charges, when clearly no one has smoked in the room. I tell them the above story and mention that unless they find ash they cant charge me. I also put a hold to the transaction amount they charged.   Now they call me back and tell me they found ash !   WTF?! What options do I have here reddit??
People just shouldnt do give aways if they are gunna set requirements like that. Like if you want them going to people who have helped others then go search down that TSV's page and post an offer if they want the egg. I feel people do this just for a false sense of authority to be able to say "no you cant have it , but you can"
Oh, I dunno, the large swaths of the planet that are inhospitable to human life? The arctic and antarctic, the tundras, jungles, deserts, mountains, savannas, bodies of water. Many of those places, humans only survive through a great deal of struggle, and still they suffer high mortality from disease, wildlife attacks, injury, environmental exposure--that's even assuming there are any humans there at all. And those areas in which we live comfortably have mostly had to have undergone a drastic transformation over decades or centuries of human activity.
which one should i be starting? I dont have room in my flex (have Tabzz as flex). This decision is so hard. Selife has carried me quite a few weeks, but link gets consistent point. any thoughts?
The only reason you see it as a possibility worth seriously considering is because you've been raised from birth to respect the idea, because it's so popular. Sure, the kind of God you're talking about is possible. But there's no more evidence for it than for any of the gods we've invented. So it's simpler to just assume that this is another god we've invented. After all... you pretty much did that in the OP. We have no more reason to believe in the god you outlined than any other.
Totalbiscuit originally recommended the Yogscast for Polaris, I believe. This makes him recieve some finances from the Yogs, but I'm not 100% sure, citation needed.   He's called them out a few times for Yogventures and the indie games developer sponsorship ideas.   Totalbiscuit then called out the Yogscast for doing paid promotions, they responded by clearly marking them in the video instead of in the comments.   Yogscast Lewis replied to Totalbiscuit and pointed out he does the same and hundreds of other youtubers do too, far more, and questioned why he singled out the yogscast repeatedly.   Then Gamergate, which I don't fuckimg understand, but Simon and TB are on the opposite sides of.   Now Simon called him a crying pissbaby wor moaning about some shit, which apparently is a big deal.
A little back story: I hooked up with a girl last summer and she asked me not to tell anyone.  I told her I didn't but I did tell my closest friends.  She asked me often whether I told anyone and I continually denied it (lied to her).  She found out several months ago and was pissed.  She decided to keep seeing me but holds a grudge over it.   Things got really bad over this summer because of the grudge.  She started to pull away and started thinking I was a bad person because of my previous lie.  She also started talking to someone else.  I told her we should go our separate ways and she said ok.  After that, as a single man, I went to Europe and ended up having sex with two girls (a condom was used both times).   When I came back we started talking again.  She asked if I made out with anyone.  I told her I did.  I didn't tell her about the sex.  She told me she wanted to work things out with me.  She is currently still closed off and holding the grudge.   We have some mutual friends so I feel like she might find out even if I don't say anything (the friends I went with have already told other friends, who have told other friends).  I have asked those who are aware of what I did to not talk about my sex life but I doubt they'll oblige.  I fear if she finds out through our mutual friends she might think that I lied to her because I withheld this information when she asked if I made out with anyone, which will exacerbate the grudge.   I also feel like it's better if it comes from my mouth.  It's been 3 weeks since I have gotten back and I've seen her once and we have not had sex.  I'm torn whether to do it now when she's closed off (which may make her not want to work through things but may hurt less), wait until we become sexually active again (telling her before), or not bring it up because I was single.   Do I tell her?
Here's the Nyan Cat trademark.](   The trademark isn't for the image of Nyan Cat, it is for the phrase "Nyan Cat."  Like, each time you say Nyan Cat you should probably be putting Nyan Cat^TM.  Therefore, there is no bearing on whether it is a Pop-Tarts^TM or a toaster pastry.   The image of Nyan Cat is copyrighted instead.  This uses a Pop-Tarts^TM / toaster pastry in the image but makes no claim to it being a Pop-Tarts^TM.  Therefore, Pop-Tarts^TM doesn't have any claim to trademark infringment based on the image of Nyan Cat^TM.   Pop-Tarts^TM may have a claim of trademark infringement based on the fact that he is marketing Nyan Cat^TM merchandise (probably) and has used the mention of Pop-Tarts^TM.   This would probably be a weak case as he was referring to it generically as a pop tart instead of trying to make a connection of "this cat is made from this specific brand of toaster pastry called Pop-Tarts^TM."   However, any trademark infringement of Pop-Tarts^TM does not nullify the copyright of the Nyan Cat^TM image nor the trademark of the phrase "Nyan Cat."
Since there's no top level comment that explains this, I'll collate some of the correct answers from other comments:   First of all, Hershey's is not trying to block  all  Cadbury's chocolate. They're going after a specific importer who imports the majority of UK chocolate.   Secondly, the way they're allowed to do this isn't exactly through a contract they have with Cadbury's. Yes, they have exclusive rights to manufacture Cadbury's chocolate for distribution in the United States. That isn't the important part—the important part is that they have exclusive rights in the United States to Cadbury's  trademarks . For all intents and purposes, this means that Hershey's owns the trademarks in the United States.   Now for the explanastion: What's happening here is that there's a company importing Cadbury's chocolate from the UK to the United States and then marketing it as Cadbury's chocolate. Hershey's, since they own the rights to Cadbury's trademarks in the US, is suing them for trademark infringement to block the importation of the "counterfeit goods".
It takes some time to get used to the ring control, but you have to realize that most of the functions will not be used at the same time.   What I'll do is click the tail cap "on" and leave the ring in standby mode when I know I'm about to use it.  Then I'll hold the flashlight in an overhand manner with my thumb and forefinger grasping the barrel, my middle finger to rotate through the infinite adjustment and strobe, and my other two fingers supporting the bezel with the end of my palm.  (If you can picture any of that in your head hahaha)  The brightness is a little more difficult to adjust than the P25 (just manipulate the 2 stage button), but you really don't find yourself needing to go back and forth too quickly.  Generally, I find myself starting low and gradually making it brighter depending on what I encounter out there.   The only drawback to this grip is that I feel I don't have enough leverage to switch in the other direction to the RGB colors with just my middle finger, however, the included shooting grip ring does help.  I just don't use the ring because it doesn't fit into my belt holster.  Obviously, I don't think you'll run into a situation where you're going bright white light and suddenly decide "I need to switch to the red LEDs NOW!" unless you're some hardcore special forces guy, so switching to an underhand grip to reach the RGB functions isn't an issue for me.   HOWEVER, I remember reading a Surefire Flashlight ad in a magazine a while ago that bashes the adjustable lights.  Something along the lines of, "You need your flashlight now to illuminate the threat.  Unfortunately for you, your multifunction flashlight was set to the wrong setting and you couldn't see the threat.  Now you're dead."  So I suppose if I was reading with the red LED and then forgot to switch it back to white when I was done, I could run into some issues if I'm not careful.  All depends on what you're using it for.
I went on a fishing trip to Mexico and on our way back, a sea lion jumped on the back of the boat (expecting to scam some fish I would imagine). I asked our guide if I could pet him and he shook his head, held up his hand with two remaining fingers and said "lion of the sea." Never thought about it that way before, but the malicious mother fuckers.
There was one time I was eating one of those delicious bastards while sitting on the floor.  Someone called for me so I stood up rather quickly.  Somehow the motion of standing up lodged the sour in my sinuses and it took me 10 very painful sour minutes to blow it out of my nose.  It took me like a week to stop smelling the sour.
Given that Vanek is injured at the moment and given how his production has dropped, I would definitely drop him for Tlusty.  The Tlusty-Staal-Semin line has really clicked and been pretty hot, especially in terms of +/- (Staal is 7th in NHL with +19, Semin and Tlusty are 10th and 11th with +18).  They're producing in virtually every category and if Tlusty is somehow still available in your league, I would grab him in a heartbeat. Personally, I would drop Pominville for Stewart, but he's individually good enough to keep around or at least try and get a decent trade.
haha I like that pass out line, I'll have to use that myself.   I am a competitive runner and I agree. I have a years worth of free gym membership and I do intervals of things like sled pulls and jumps and running up stairs with weights. I rarely see anyone else pushing themselves to the limit like I do - not in terms of work done but visible effort put in. I do this stuff in addition to running (though not on the same day as 400's or 800's).   At the same time, I do not think you would progress if you did every workout to failure (which I think would be 100% max). My high school coach said something like "we train to race, not race to train" and I think there is truth to that.
So I met this guy about 3 years ago through a club at my school and we never really talked until one day he was asking me about the club meeting. I was too busy playing GW2 and told him that I was too busy at the moment trying to finish off a dungeon in the game. He also happened to play, and we ended up talking for the entire night about games, anime, and a whole bunch of things we had in common that we never knew about. We started seeing each other pretty intimately shortly after, watching movies, cooking, cuddling, bed stuff.. you know. However this only later about a month before I had to move out of town in order to work for a semester. Sadly he was also finishing his degree that semester and moving across the country to work.   Over the new years he was in town to visit family and we met up, caught up in life and had some fun time in bed. He then said that he wanted to show me his city, take me around town, give me a tour and what not. I told him I would be delighted.   I am a person who likes to plan things ahead.. and if it requires traveling far distances, in this case getting on a plane, I like to plan far in advance , 1-2 months prior to going. So I've tried talking to him about it a few times, sometimes he's really excited about it but then when we get into the logistics I could only visit him between Friday - Sunday, and he doesn't have any holidays at the moment since he used them all to visit his family. Now when I ask him about visiting in early April he either avoids answering or tells me that it's too much money for me to spend just for a 3 day trip.   I feel like hes pushing me to not visit him and it kind of hurts because he's someone i care about deeply, and I don't really care about spending the money because it's total worth it just to see him again... Now this is not something I've told him because I've discussed with him before his feelings towards me and a relationship, and although he likes me a lot and cares for me, he doesn't want a relationship that is long distance.   I'm at a lost though.. I have very strong feelings for him... I'm not sure what they are exactly, I probably wouldn't call it love but it seems pretty close. If I've had more time with him, more time to talk, more time to play, more time to just be around and with him I would've probably been long gone. I'm not sure about the full extent of his feelings.. I know that if we were closer we would be in a relationship, and that's about it. I think he doesn't feel as strongly about me though because his views on long distance things is that they're hopeless. He doesn't see me as a potential partner anymore,but whenever he talks about showing me his city I always feel like there's some sort of hope...   Am I being delusional? Should I just give up? Do I back down? Do I attack? I don't know how to act towards him about this anymore. Before now I would just pursue him with flirty messages like "hey handsome", or things like" I need a certain someone to come keep me warm ;)" but now I just don't know what to use. I don't really get what he wants from me. Does he want to be with me? Does he just want to have sex with me? Does he still care or has all his feelings for me died away because of the way things are?   I'm mostly here to rant since I don't have any close friends, and any advice, or someone to talk to about anything, doesn't have to be about this, can be games, anime, life, whatever you feel like.
I played Tt tonight vs a tryndy as Gragas. I got 4 kill on him before 6. He hit six, then proceeded to get 5 kill and no deaths (before or after loaning phase I'm not sure). Their best player was a 5/1 pantheon and I was a 9/1 Gragas. I could roflstomp pantheon and nasus instantly, but tryndy would just ultimate and hit me for his GP back. Even with my spammable dash, I couldn't kite him long enough most of the time.
I've been dating this guy for almost 6 months now. At the end of February, I go to study abroad in Australia for 4 months. I'm incredibly in love with him and we have a very close, caring relationship. However, both of us  have a hard time being physically apart for a long time. Every time I've brought up a conversation thus far, he has said "its a few months away lets not worry yet".  Obviously I'm getting worried now that the time is coming closer.  What are some options for couples when one studies abroad? Is it better to stay together or to take a break?   Edit: I'm from America and will be in Australia, my initials are NZ, which is why that's my user-name.
My boyfriend and I have been dating almost 9 months now. He is a great guy, he treats me well, our sexual chemistry (and non-sexual for that matter) is unreal - unlike anything I've ever experienced. I know he cares about me and he does love me. I love him also, very much so. Although it has taken me a while to get used to the way he does things (he's a busy guy with work and such, not a big texter - but still sends a text every day at some point - he's very laid back and a man of few words, so he doesn't always express affection or feelings all that well, but he is still affectionate), I think I'm getting better at knowing who he is and how he does things.   The issue. I find myself OBSESSING over little things, like the words or format in a text he sends or he spills his heart out to me one day then the next we're watching tv and he's not even touching me, or the sex wasn't off-the-charts amazing one time. BUT, he has no idea that I obsess over these things, because I don't tell him. I keep them all to myself. Because if I tell him every little thing that goes through my head, he would think I'm insane. I get over these little things, whether it be the next time I see him in person or whatever (when I see things are completely fine and I've been anxious for no reason). The weird thing is, that although I have some anxiety issues (they've never been that bad), I'm normally a pretty laid back, cool person. So when I'm with him, that is who I am, because...that's normally who I am. I don't know WHY all of a sudden I feel like I need to over analyze EVERY.LITTLE.THING. I journal in order to get my thoughts out, but that doesn't seem to help either.   I'm so happy when I'm with him, and when things are going well (in my mind) I'm happy as can be, I'm my normal self. But for some reason, when I start over analyzing everything, I turn into a different person that I really don't like. I know this has absolutely nothing to do with him and everything to do with me. He's really not doing anything wrong and I know that. Which is the main reason why I don't voice any of this to him. However, I have voiced a couple things, but never in an accusatory way. He knows I worry sometimes, and a couple times he's been so stressed at work and that's been the cause of some of these things. So we've talked about that. It's not that I don't voice anything to him at all or don't communicate. It's just that I know I'll come across as a crazy person if I voice all of this to him, that's all. I don't see a point in it. I want to deal with my own issues, because they're not his to deal with.   It's just that this over-thinking bull-sh*t is causing me to obsess over him and our relationship, and I've never been like that in past relationships before. I don't want to lose him. I want to be as happy as I am on the good days the majority of the time. I guess what I'm asking of you kind folks is, have any of you had issues like this? How did you get through it? Any recommendations you can give me would be greatly appreciated, as I don't want to self-sabotage this relationship with an amazing person. I don't want to ruin something that I know really is great, I just don't know how to tell this voice in my head that's making up issues to shut up and let me be happy.   Sorry for the long post.....thank you to any of you that actually read it :)
In preschool (of course we swung only about an inch), me and my friends would get on the swings, and the others who didn't get swings would stand in front of us. We seemed to enjoy getting kicked in the stomach. I also jumped off once and landed on my face.
So I'm in kind of a weird situation.   I am constantly distracted by every little thing that the universe sees fit to hurl across my path but I still manage my own dumb ass. I'm just finishing high school in a month, and it has been the hardest thing I've done with my life so far. Don't get me wrong, the feeling is great, and I love that it's over but I want to go to university next year and I don't know how I'll deal with the work volume. Don't get me wrong, I work hard as a mofo at school, I get all of my assignments in and I do my best to study as often as I can but it costs me.   All nighters are common, last minute projects are the standard fare. I struggle to divide work and finish it on time. I do my absolute best to finish work that should only take an hour but winds up consuming my whole evening. I'm far too easily distracted to the point that I can't work with a computer near me. If I even turn it on to look up the answer to a tough question I run the risk of typing "www.re-" into chrome and we all know where that road leads.   I have a job that I commit 25-30 hours a week to, and from an 18 year old's perspective, I make bank. Just like school, I work hella hard for what I've got. My manager loves me, and work is nice because of the pace. The pace is 0-60 the moment I walk through the door and it doesn't let up until I leave. I feel exhausted at the end but it's great because I can constantly switch focus to one thing or another and still be doing something productive.   I took ritalin as a kid and it did help me some, but my parents ended up talking to the doctor and cancelling my prescription because they "didn't like what it was doing to me." So I'm wondering now, should I talk to the folks at the hospital again and explain what I'm going through in hopes for a vyvanse or adderal prescription to make it easier to work on school or should I continue to struggle and beat myself to death in the hopes that it will get easier as time goes on? I don't know how to do this? How do I approach them?   On the exterior I look like a normal, productive teenager. I'm trying to get into engineering after HS for Pete's sake, but the struggle to get here has been so unimaginably hard that I can't imagine working like this for the next four years. I'm just too disorganized, too slow to work on deadlines, too bad at remembering things. I put in so much work to be where I am, but it's killing me. I have no energy for anything. My life is in a rut. I'm stuck in the pattern and I can't break out because the rut is the only thing holding me on the rails right now. If I step too far out everything goes flying wildly out of control.   I was sick last week and all of my carefully planned work collapsed around me and I've been trying to pick up the pieces since. I know it's 'only highschool' and everyone does it, but that doesn't make it any easier. It only makes it harder, seeing all these other people, living their happy, full lives and here I am, stumbling along like a robot, trying to finish everything mostly proper and on time and all it's doing is slowly killing me. All I want to do is get on a boat and travel around the world. I don't want to work for a living, scrape by for years and hope to save enough to retire; I just want to exist and see the world I've been born into, all of it, in all of its aspects.   All I think about is how much I want to do anything but what I have to. It's so easy to just do anything but what is expected that I do. I spend so much time procrastinating that if I actually used that time to put work in I would be so ahead of the game it wouldn't even be funny. I just can't find the motivation anywhere. I don't know. I don't know what to do, where I want to go, what I want to do with my life. I know I want to build things, and that's a start. I like helping people. I just can't help myself.
Season 1 Episode 9: Repairs Synopsis": A mysterious force threatens Phil Coulson's team when they bring in a StatiCorp safety inspector named Hannah Hutchins who is blamed for an explosion that killed some technicians at StatiCorp's Particle Acceleration Complex where it is believed that she has manifested telekinesis. Coulson's team soon discover that the mysterious force is actually a Particle Acceleration Complex worker named Tobias Ford who is trapped between Earth and "Hell" (which Tobias believes that he is being dragged to) following the explosion and is targeting Hannah to protect her from those who were harm her, as he accidentally caused the explosion to get time with Hannah.   Fitz and Simmonds spend part of the episode trying to determine why the particle accelerator exploded. Simmonds soon discovers that the particle accelerator may have tapped into some kind alien dimension or unknown place. Tobias appears and says that it is "Hell". However, [this is what unknown place Simmonds finds looks like.](   Here are [two]( [images]( of the alien planet. In my opinion they are too similar to just be a coincidence.   I believe that the particle accelerator somehow opened up a portal to the alien planet IT is on. Tobias could have possibly been possessed by IT because we do know that when IT takes the body of a dead person, IT retains at least some of that person's memories.
Crashed my Motorcycle going 65+ MPH on a Highway in Oregon.  My rear tire locked up when the engine seized due to a oil leak.  The driver behind me hit me.  I flew off the motorcycle and skidded on my butt for about 70 feet.  My jeans ripped all the way down.  Cars screamed by me on either side at 50+ MPH.  I was amazed I survived with no injuries to speak of except tons of road rash.  To top it off all of the traffic stopped behind me and people ran out of their cars and started clapping when I jumped up.  Once traffic cleared a guy in a candy truck, I kid you not, let me crash at his place until I got a plane ticket home.
I was on Effexor for a year as a teenager and hated it -- no highs, no lows.  It discouraged me from trying other medications.  Now, a decade later, I've been taking Wellbutrin for almost a year and the difference is night and day.   What Wellbutrin does is hard to explain, because I don't feel like it does anything.  I don't feel artificially happy or feel like I'm being kept from feeling sad, instead I just feel like me.  The Wellbutrin me, however, is more upbeat, more outgoing, and feels better.  People around me comment on what a dramatic difference it has made in my attitude, my behavior, and my actions, yet I don't feel that any of it is fake.  I just feel like me.
Before I start, I'm a 12 year old boy, and I know that nothing happening now really matters too much, but I'm really frustrated about what just happened.   Earlier this year, I met a nice boy, who I ended up being friends with. I would not say best friends, quite yet, but almost there. I also met a nice girl that I really like, thus was in October by the way. My friend at the time liked someone else, and when I told him I liked her, he didn't really care, they knew each other, but at the time he did not like her.   In January I really started thinking about this girl a lot, but never asked her out because it's only middle school, it's realitivly pointless, and I don't even know my parents rules on dating if you could call it that, in middle school.   Now it is March, and my friend has just started to like the same girl as me, but says isn't going to try and "sabotage" me or anything like that. Based on this girls actions, I think that if given the choice, she would pick him over me.   Just to clarify, non of us are popular, but we are all pretty well known. We are all smart, but none of us get bullied or teased for it.   I was not present during anything in the following paragraph, but it was told to me by my good friend mentioned earlier.   Now, because my friend and this girl were both in the school musical, I was not, they both have a cast party on Friday after school. He set up a Google Plus for her, just so she could talk on Google Hangouts, which is just texting if you didn't know. He has a hangout with just her, and me, him, and her. Apparently on the same night, they started "dating", and she found out that I like her.   Now the people that managed to set this up were my crush and friends older siblings, who told each other that their siblings like the other, and Vic versa.   Finally, earlier tonigh my friend told me this on hangouts after all of us talking in the group hangout for a while. I told him he would it loses friend or anything, but just expressed my frustration and anger.   I don't know what to do about this, and I really just feel terrible about the whole thing. This was my first crush that I thought about all of the time, and I really did like her. Any help on what I shiuld do would me much appreciated, and just say if you need anymore information, than what I have given.
100 kg for 100€   1€ =$ 1.35 (today)   1 kg = 2.2 lbs   i.e. 220 lbs = $135 (with eco-parcel within Europe).   You paid between $60-180 for 40lbs (depending on the service seemingly from the link above) for a very similar distance albeit domestically. Let's say you paid just the bare bones $60 for the 40 lbs. That would still cost $330 minimally so ship 100 kgs as I did in Europe.
I assume your car is the tin can and the SUV hit you. I already knew it was a woman, didn't even have to ask nor read the replies. It isn't sexist when it's a truth.
Recently I sold most of the things in my bank; as this week is finals week I saw it fit to afk merch whilst I study/test.  I've netted in a nice 10-15m profit since mid/late last week.  I've flipped through a good portion of my Rs experience.  That said I lack the knowledge of short/long term investments and my flipping list seems to be limited these days as inflation kills prices.  I also don't understand how 90weaps pc works.  If you don't mind either giving me tips to merching, some flipping items, or explaining how to flip with 90weaps pc; it would be appreciated.
So, here is the story.   A little background information first. I worked for a company called The Lily co. about 6 months ago, a guy there named Curt was my boss, he hired me and trained me. Good guy.   Second bit of information, about 2 months ago, there's a guy named Curt at my current job(Dilly co.) named Curt, cool guy, good work friend. I called him up to help me move some stuff into my apt, he never answered his phone, and I thought I saved his number in my phone(which I didn't). Curt and I mess with each other at work from time to time as well.   Here goes.. a few days ago I'm sitting outside of work on a break, and I had the sudden brilliant idea to send (Dilly co.) Curt a message on my phone. ((Hey man, I'm going to kick your ass)). So I sent it, immediately I get a reply ((Who is this??)). Well my break was over, so I went inside, immediately forgetting  about the text.   Well the next day, I send Curt another message ((I want to lick your bum and sniff your beard all covered in melted cheese)) Kinda funny, I thought he would get a kick out of it. Well... no reply. So I send another: ((Garlak and Black pepper are watching you and are going to get you if you aren't careful!!!)) [inside joke at Dilly co., only he would get it I thought].. well. No reply. I thought that was kinda weird but whatever I guess.   Well last night I got an email saying roughly ((Stop sending me texts, I have a warrant out for your arrest in 3 counties, I know who you are, and I know who you are talking for, you shouldn't have messed with me, you fucked with the wrong guy, now you are going to get your ass kicked by Tom Erkenbreaker)) ... Well I thought man, either A: This isn't (Dilly co.) Curt, or B: He is just messing with me. Well.... I went with B, as per I thought for sure this was (Dilly co.) Curt. So I messed with him some more... Curt sent me another message back saying he is sending police and will press charges. At this point, I was like... Shit... this can't be the right Curt. So I called Dilly co. and asked for Curts phone number, they gave it to me. I checked the numbers... they were different.   So I called the guy I have been messaging, and was hoping for a voicemail.  I got it. It was Curt from Lily company, and this guy thinks I'm someone else. I send him another message saying exactly what the mix-up was and that I'm not who he THINKS I am. Well, given my luck, he didn't believe me and he said if I send any more messages to him he would come to my apt with Tom Erkenbreaker and kick my ass right here and now. So I stopped and thought about it for a sec... IDEA! I'll forward one of my work emails that he sent to me back when I worked for him and apologize once again. Well this is still all last night. At about 12:30am. Figures. Well I write this whole elaborate email to him explaining everything and basically showing exactly what happened and that I'm NOT who he thinks I am. So I go to bed.   TODAY!   Wake up, check email... nothing. Well crap. What do I do now? Not sure. So I do nothing, I'll just wait, maybe he didn't have time to check his email yet. I check it again in the afternoon, then at night. Still nothing, its 9:10 now, and about a half hour ago he sent this message to me via text: ((Justin... just wanted to let you know I did get your email and sorry for the misunderstanding. And Sorry it took so long to get back with you. I am a busy guy... LOL... we fired an employee and he was making serious threats against me and several employees that he was going to shoot people and beat peoples asses... and sending crazy emails and voice mails.... thanks for sending your email.... and I sent the info to the police. So everything is cool. So don't worry about anything)) I just replied back to him saying thanks again ect.   Well so that's the story how I really did have a legit warrant out for my arrest and a crazy guy trying to track me down and kick my ass. Well that will teach me to check my numbers before I dial them haha...
Great Country?   No. Great idea of distributing a potentially life saving vaccine for free. Yes.   Many people tend to have a distorted view of Cuba, their politics, their people and the exiled community which now resides in the US. From the perspective of their healthcare system, Cuba is usually held in high regard. Often used as an example when discussing universal healthcare vs the U.S. healthcare system. It's true, in Cuba everyone is "covered" and everyone has access to free "healthcare". Now there is a distinct difference between having access to something and actually getting it. Cuba is an impoverished country thanks to it's many years of Fidelism, (by which I mean Fidel's version of communism). Resources are scarce, especially since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The hospitals and clinics in Cuba often run out of even basic supplies. Access to common modern medical equipment that you find in almost all US hospitals are hard to come by or for many of it's citizens are just not available. Remember in Cuba everything is rationed and distributed, including food and medicine.   Recently, Venezuela and Cuba have had a particularly close relationship. Thanks in most part to the almost sycophantic obsession Hugo Chavez has with Fidel Castro. So their has been a slight increase in money flowing to Cuba. Also, and this is important. Medical tourist (ie tourist visiting Cuba to receive medical attention) do not see the impoverished side to the Cuban healthcare system. They are paying good money for their medical treatment so they get access to the best services/care. But that's capitalism!, you say. Yes, and it also highlights the hypocrisy of the communist system in Cuba, which is why it is on it's legs. So the rosy picture Michael Moore painted of the Cuban healthcare system in his most recent documentary is a distorted version at best (which is a shame because I love Michael Moore :/ ).   A side note : I'm not calling into question the quality of the doctors, nurses, medical staff in Cuba. As far as I know, they are incredibly capable (perhaps even more so because they less to work with).   How do you know this shit?  Both my parents are Cuban exiles who arrived here with their family in the 1960's. I grew up in Miami; ground zero for the Cuban exile community and by extension end up learning a large amount about a country you've never visited. I've had many conversations about this very subject with recently emigrated Cuban doctors. Unfortunately, I haven't visited nor experienced their healthcare system first hand so my limited experience may not be a 100% accurate representation of current realities.
I see how it would seem like that, but what we are discovering is that the spectrum is  broader  than we thought, so some "fringe kids" who would get a kick out the door and a "good luck" instead of getting help they needed are now being included in this. It  is  also causing fewer diagnoses in one area, and that is in disorders which mimic autism (ocd, anxiety, social phobia, depression, etc). There are now more, and better, ways to differentiate. So, we lose some diagnoses from more accurate qualification, gain some for opening the spectrum to include a wider range of symptoms, and gain some from some doctors being lazy ass holes and deserving to lose their license (as well as some honest mistakes; they happen, doctors are human too). This ends up with a net gain in the number of autism diagnoses.
I've (28M) been dating my girlfriend (33F) for about 9 months. A few weeks ago, I had a first outbreak of genital herpes. I tested positive in a swab test but negative in a blood test (IGG antibodies test), which implies that I was recently infected, since antibodies usually take a few months to be produced. We assumed that she was an asymptomatic carrier and infected me, but she just got a NEGATIVE result back for the IGG blood test! She said that the doctor told her that these tests are 100% accurate, genital herpes is impossible to spread without sex, and that I have definitely been cheating on her! But I have not been cheating!!!   It has been an amazing relationship up to this point, and I'm terrified that this will end it. I'm running out of time, and I don't know what to say to her. She wants to trust me, but when the evidence says 99.99% that I'm cheating, she feels like she doesn't have a choice. How should I approach this? Is there somewhere else that I could have been infected? Is there something that could have caused a false negative test result? Please help!
I have a degree in IT and a job in IT, most days are 5% critical thinking, 10% slacking off, 25% simple tasks and 50% bureaucratic paperwork.   The last two weeks I've been on a project and I've been maybe 90% simple but phsyically demanding tasks and 5% critical thinking but for less technical, more logistical things like how best to stack X000 assets over 3 pallets. I get home body-tired everyday rather than just bored out of my skull. If you can do it without damaging your body for your later years, I highly recommend the tradie way of life. The culture, the work ethic, sleeping like a log each night, if it wasn't for the pay I'd drop my airconditioned office in an instant to be stacking boxes or fixing cars - until my back gave out, at least.
Where do you people get all this money from!?   It's like you've somehow worked out a system whereby you  work  in exchange for monetary compensation...but we  all  know that's a ridiculous notion!
I was thinking the chief; he would assume he either has blue or brown eyes, since he cannot see his own. He would be the last person to leave the island; he does not know his eye color. So, he would be saying he sees the eyes of someone taking him away, but he would never be taken away since he doesn't know his eye color.
Well long story semi short. [ Not native in english, sorry for any grammar errors ]   We have been a couple for 10 months now. My bf is a super busy student, that's involved with all kinds of student organizations. I'm in a different uni in the same town and not involved in such stuff. I prefer hanging out with friends and organizing stuff together. Recently I also been opening up to all my friends and classmates, even both of my parents, to make life easier for me and bf. He opened up to a few friends a couple of years ago but refuses to tell any of his current friends. He gets mad every time I even get close to the subject. Says he can't talk about it and I'm just nagging and being overly-demanding. Told him that he does not have to stress at all but that I just want his point of view.   So hence comes the problems.  Weekends: I'm free, he: Always has some kind of fun activity with uni friends, who he isn't open with, so I can't join any stuff.. Mon-fri when we hangout he normally has to study after school until 19-21.00 so that he can have weekends free for doing things (with out me).  He has stuff planed the 5 upcoming weekends, non that involves me.  There for we seldom do any fun stuff together. Maybe once-twice every month we visit friends, go drinking or visit the cinema.   I love spending time with him, and our times on town together has been a blast. But still I always has to force myself into his schedule. He told me he loves that I give him suggestions but that he indirectly makes clear that he can't plan anything because there might come "must-go-to" uni-events. He says that those activities are stuff that are essential to his life and therefor he can't work around them.   Usually ends with him asking that if the two of hanging out 4d/w isn't enough? And me saying "yeah if we actually did stuff and not just studied or watched a movie together in silence". Thats where get into a dead end with me saying he neglects me and doesn't want to do any fun, he says that " we hangout aaallll thhee time stop demanding so much, we are two persons not 1 "... I never ever felt like the clingy kinda guy before :/ Would be worth my weight in gold if anyone can give me some tips and reflections. HELP ME REDDIT.
I disagree for a couple of reasons.  First, I read ptichka & couldawouldashoulda's comments, the comments that you are implicitly and explicitly replying to, as simultaneously looking at the legality of the situation as well as the morality of it.  They both seem to be in agreement that what he did is legally and morally incorrect.   Regardless, the intersection of law and philosophy are interesting and jurisprudence is one of my favorite areas of study.  So, indeed, part of where we are not in concordance is that I am attempting to analyze this like a lawyer, especially since I already have it in my head that the ages of the parties most likely make this a strict liability offense.   I agree with your comment that some young persons physically and mentally mature at different rates, but the framers of our legal institutions seem to agree that 12 is a pretty bright-line age to apply a societal objective standard as opposed to having judges look at each individual 12 years and younger in these circumstances to determine what their age of mental maturation is.
So in regard of recent threads, especially the ones about homecoming I realize I hate the American school system even more that I did before, especially when it comes to the more sexual stuff.   Now, I am a proud 17 year old Dane and I go to what you could compare to the American High School, and reading about all the crazy school stories about homecoming and a freaking "No grinding" rule.   What. The. Fuck?!   Seriously, you're banning girls from grinding their innocent butt cheeks of awesome up and down a dudes crotch? For what reason? They're gonna end up having sex and get pregnant? Well let me tell you a few things...   As far as I understand, (correct me if I'm wrong) when it comes to Sex education in America it seems to me that they're teaching it as "Sooner sex is bad sex! Just don't do it!" Instead of saying "You're starting to become adults and sex is god damn interesting! Let me teach you how you don't fuck up and get pregnant!"   Here in Denmark we use the last way of approach and we really doesn't have a major problem with it.   According to Wikipedia,  41  31 of every 1,000 teenager gets pregnant in USA while it's only 8 in Denmark, and we even have alcohol thrown into this deadly cocktail of raging hard-ons and slutty girls in this raging war against our hormones. Can someone please help me understand this?
Think about what "platinum" means. Platinum means less than one third of one percent of the population of the United States  alone  liked your album. Eighty four million people watched the Mitt Romney Vs Barack Obama Epic Rap Battle of History. Over 212 million watched I Just Had Sex by Lonely Island.   It's an outdated term to describe how difficult distribution and advertising was 50+ years ago.   Aside from the large numbers involved the entire business model has changed. Them being Platinum is probably more proof that they are exactly as bad as people say they are: it's that their fans still actually  buy CDs.  As was always, CD sales are and will be manipulated for marketing and image purposes. In 1950, when the population of the US was approximately 150 million, 1 million purchases was huge. Today an artist can release a song on iTunes and have over 250k sales in a single  day.  Three major changes have happened. One, market penetration exploded. With market penetration came demographic pandering. Two, digital distribution wiped out the classic tactics of advertising. It actually made it easier to artificially hype a band. Three, the majority of music listened to isn't purchased any more. It's stolen, streamed or free in general.
This is how I learned.  Vanilla game and fortress quick start on the wiki.  Reason I started with vanilla is that the wiki screenshots are all in ascii. Made it easier to follow. Took a couple sessions and restarts to start to wrap my head around things.  Took me several world generations before I realized what the umkh keys do.  That seems silly now but the amount of information I was trying  to digest can be overwhelming.  After I got a good feel for it I got the lazy newb  pack and started using the best tool hands down is dwarf therapist.  Installed a graphics pack, Phoebus, and that really helped. Then I learned about dfhack  and work flow. Work flow is awesome. Now I have decent grasp of how to play but I learned something new every session.
Okay, r/relationships, I'm in a bit of a doozy. I'm on mobile, so please excuse my clumsy wording and grammar. This is also my throwaway for all my r/relationships needs.   So I met this guy, J, a few months ago through a mutual friend. We really hit it off, and started dating last month. He is an amazing person, always super kind and polite, and goes out of his way to help others any chance he gets. I've never once seen him be rude or generally mean to other people, and he's the most sincere person I've ever dated. It's safe to say that I am incredibly lucky to have met someone so lovely.   There is one drawback: he's homeless. He can't even afford a car. He has a job, but his schedule is incredibly inconsistent, so he can't even afford his phone bill. Luckily, he's looking for a second job to help, but the going isn't well. He has PTSD, and customer service really does a number on his mental state. He's looking into assisted living, but I fear that might not be enough either. I can't offer him a place to stay due to my living circumstances, and I feel awful about it. He can't live with his family, as they are incredibly abusive, and very few people are willing to let him room with them due to his financial situation. Thankfully, my best friend has offered him to stay at her house occasionally to sleep and to shower (I am forever thankful to her).   I invite him over whenever I can so he's out of the heat and so he can eat and relax without having to worry about other people, but I feel like I'm not doing enough. I buy him food and water so he doesn't go hungry, and lent him some of my art supplies to help him with commissions (he also draws and is hoping to get an apprenticeship at a tattoo parlor, which would benefit him greatly). It's a strange situation that I've never dealt with before, but it's unfortunately very common in my area for young adults to be homeless and on the streets.   I guess my question is, what more can I do? I am not willing to throw away a relationship based solely off the fact that he's homeless. We have so much in common, and I have a lot of faith in this relationship. I'm hoping this is just a rough patch, but I'm more than willing to stick by him and help in any way possible.
Had a hellish hangover yesterday and spent all day in bed. Very intense migraine all day, painful stomach, feel sick, couldn't think straight. I couldn't work out how I was so ill after only drinking beer, until my friend reminded me of the gin (oh yes... the gin).   Just watched a video of myself my friend filmed that night and I was all over the place. I'd never seen myself drunk in a video before, it's really weird watching yourself in that state, and I found it pretty shocking. My friend however didn't seem to think there was anything shocking about it (your always like that, it's normal for someone who is drunk) - we'll, I don't think it's normal, him and my other friend don't act like someone with Parkinsons when they are drunk. I'm not happy with it. Also sliced my finger with a knife trying to cut a lime.   Also just bumped into a friend I went to school with a few hours ago, and I could barely make conversation with her. My head was still fuzzy. She asked what i've been up to. I was too ashamed to admit i've been out of work for 7 & 1/2 months. It's pathetic. This ends today.   I'd been concentrating on trying to fix some of my other addictions recently, but I realize now it was too much. I need to concentrate entirely on booze if I am to beat this thing. Booze is the drug which has taken the most from me in my life, forget internet addiction, caffeine or anything else.   Yesterday 12/12/15 was my first day sober, and I pledge that I will be sober 1 year from now on 12/12/16 . I'll decide then whether I want to take up drinking again, but I wanted to write this post for accountability.   I'm no longer willing to exchange 3 hours of pleasure for almost 2 days in bed hungover or feeling shitty. It ends now.
I'm nearly 23 years old and about to earn my bachelor's this December. I haven't looked into many (career) job opportunities because, honestly, I haven't had much of an idea of what I really want to do with my immediate future. I've heavily considered following in my older brother's footsteps, travelling the country with copious amounts of my favorite whatevers and seeing all there is to see, but I will not realistically have the resources to commit to such an experience any time soon. Even though I've done what I can to reduce the amount of student loans I've taken on over the years, I still have a hefty amount of debt that I'll need to start paying off six months after I graduate, and I haven't been able to save up much of anything because I've been living mostly paycheck to paycheck as a full-time student.   As of right now, I just can't see myself getting a job that will allow me to cover my necessities (food, rent, insurance, etc.) while also letting me chip away at those student debts at a reasonable rate without having to get sucked into more debt. It's not that I don't want to work, I just have a desire to do something a meaningful with my life for a few years. This is what made me consider enlisting as an officer in either the Army or Marine Corps.   As I'm aware of it, the military would assume my student debt while letting me save up a bit of money over my time serving, which would be a TREMENDOUS help to me later on down the road when I'm ready to enact my master plan of starting and running my own small business. I've never been opposed to the idea of joining up, and when I brought the subject up to my family they were suprisingly supportive, saying that they've always thought that I would do well in the military. In any case, I think the experience may help develop skills I can use later on in life when I'm ready to move on to my other life goals. I am sure, however, that most of my preconceptions and expectations of the military are far from what it's really like, so that's why I'm here referring to my favorite online community!   I'm meeting with an OSO for the Marines soon, and I am hoping some of you could share some experiences you've had with recruiters or offer any advice on what information I should be sure to get out of the meeting, recruiter tactics to be aware of, etc. A few questions I'm going to ask involve:   *Occupational Specialties   *Responsibilities as an officer and in regards to occupational specialty   *School debt details   *Schedule of training/deployment   Thanks guys. This is something I'm taking very seriously, and I want to be as prepared as possible so that I know I'm making the right choice one way or the other when the time comes.
Will this game be fun? Probably a fuck ton of fun actually. That Nemesis System sounds great. If it didn't have "Lord of the Rings" in the title to bandwagon its way to more more I'd say I'm looking forward to it.   Will this game be in any way accurate? A fuck ton of no.   I saw the timeline and thought "Oh maybe a game about Aragorn doing badass stuff before LotR? That could be could really cool and there's plenty of material in the Appendices to work with."  Kept reading and...NOPE! The character is some ranger with "wraith abilities". What the fuck?
When you say, "The moral of the story." You're speaking from the writers perspective. When you say, "
Let's pretend that the circumstances in Mass Effect 3 are even more dire than they ever been.   After Shepard's crew split up to face off against the Reapers on their own home worlds, Shepard and the other human crewmates make their way to Earth to face-off against Earth's Reaper threat--and they do so in dominating fashion.  But the Reapers, in their final moment of spite, decide that if they cannot be the lords of organic life, no one can--and they move to remotely detonate all mass effect relays in the universe the moment before they themselves are wiped out.  Currently, every race is within their respective sectors fighting off the residual Reaper threat such that if a Relay is destroyed in the Turian system, all Turians will die, (Asari system, all Asari perish, and so on...).  Shepard has gathered four failsafes that can overwrite the detonation commands in time.   And so, which four races do you save and lead into a new dawn of organic life and balance?
The short answer is rarely.   It really depends on the situation.  In most fights, you need unchained to deal with tankswap/add mechanics, so it's not available to be used other than those times.  When you don't need to do any sort of tanking mechanics in the first two minutes of the fight, it's fairly common to do an unchained opener(use all storm's eye combos during this if the pld is pulling in sword oath, which he should be).  Using it mid fight for dps, however, is rarely an option.  It takes more than a full GCD to pop all the oGCDs you need to unchained, so you'll pretty much break even on dps at best.  The bonus crit rate is fairly negligible; your only real gain is doing an inner beast, and you're risking performing an auto attack with the defiance penalty at the beginning and possibly the end of the time you spend in defiance, which is a loss of a little over 25 potency each auto attack.  It can be worthwhile to do if you're forced to disengage due to a mechanic(meteor stream + divebombs or something), but these situations rarely come up.

So for several months I have been developing feelings for one of my best friends and now housemate. We're both people who don't want to jump into relationships, as we both are people who like to take things at a snail's pace. I'll not reveal the details of what I love about her as that I feel is a personal matter.   However, a few weeks ago I finally gathered the courage to tell her what I felt about her. She feels the same as I do and we share the same concerns, being that we are best friends who live together, if shit goes south it is highly likely to crash and burn. We're both level headed people though, we do not have any sort of demands or expectations, other than to be good to one another (though that should go without saying).   Here's the thing, given everything so far about us, I know that I love her. I know this isn't infatuation, I've been there and am tired of that. Its our friendship that drew me to her. I went through a really rough time, details I won't discuss, and she was there for me, she gave me the emotional support that I needed and without her I know I would have been worse for where compared to where I am today. I care for her more than I have for anybody I've ever had any sort of bond with. When I see her smile there's a certain peace that fills me, when her laugh is sweeter than any music, and when I see her saddened, hurt, or in tears I feel my heart break some.   And that is what scares me, what do you do when you care this much about a person? I would do anything to make sure she is safe, happy, and successful. What do you think reddit?
Not true... I started tinkering with programming back in my HS days - back then we were taught PASCAL on Apple IIe! I didn't get it and to this day have no idea how I passed.   I remember being given an assignment to do some simple calculation of sorts and instead of building an array, I just did like 20 sub-routines for each instance of the problem. I then took EE major in college and my CompSci (now Fortran programming) made me realize I wasn't cut out for programming... and dropped it.   However, my lessons weren't over - I tried my hand at VB3 and combination of having shitty teachers/severe case of A.D.D. made me realize I couldn't concentrate enough to see where the sub started/ended, why my code wouldn't run (missing syntax, etc.)... so I became PC Tech/Systems Engineer. Which suited me just fine and I think I did well for myself (now doing architecture/etc.)   However, it came back full circle - in order for me to adequately support technologies I work with, I now need to learn/understand shit like Unix Shell scripting, Python, RoR, Powershell, SQL queries, and possibly C# (for FIM/IDM). CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!!   I just can't wrap my mind around programming. I don't know if it's a mental barrier or I didn't have good teachers, or something else... but part of me wants to learn (judging by all the programming books I have at home)... but I just lack the concentration and seeing far enough ahead to build an algorithm.
A friend of mine had to come to her house to check something out I find particularly odd. My computer (lenovo windows 7) connects fine to her router, as do other computers. Her computer (Toshiba windows 7) connects to the router, but makes the internet access limited (no internet connection) for everyone one her router. Her toshiba connects just fine to other routers. Any ideas? I've never seen something like this before.   I just ran malwarebytes and removed some programs before trying again with the same results.
Book burning, as you say, have lost a bit of its edge with the advent of the internet. It does, however, have a strong historical meaning. Book burnings were committed to exterminate ideas, something I think we can all agree was a bad idea.   But to expand it to a broader context: should we exterminate ideas deemed dangerous? Most people agree that the Golden Dawn in Greece is dangerous and that the idea should be removed for the good of society. But should we? How do we determine what ideas should be removed? Some Muslims think that freedom of speech is antithetical to Islam (drawing Muhammed, blasphemy etc). Some atheists think that religion should be destroyed and erased from history. Some feminists ( cough  Atheism+  cough ) think that freedom of speech is the best thing ever, as long as the speech agrees with them and their feels.   Where do we draw the line of acceptable ideas? The simplest solution: there is no line, all ideas, however putrid or glorious, should be allowed to exists on equal terms.
I've been that guy (except I'm a girl, and not totally). By that I mean, I have my baggage. I had an abusive upbringing, I was raped and abused by my first bf, I handled it all poorly turning to self harming coping skills....   First, I wouldn't discount someone just because they've had some bad experiences. But, to me there are some key red flags that you need to think about. Do not stay with someone out of pity, weigh what you're looking for and the risk/reward factor.   My concerns:   1) He told you too much too soon. I suspect that had you had three or so fabulous dates, and then he sat you down and said "Look, we need to have a bit of a serious conversation. I hate that I have to tell you these things, but the reality is I do. Here is what happened to me, here is its affect on me, and here is how I'm dealing with it."   By blurting it out too soon, he's given you too much to deal with, and he hasn't shown you that he's worth the work by showing you more sides of him -- right now the only side you know is that he's got issues, and he's great at sex.   2) He had sex before he was ready. There is a lot of pressure on people to have sex and be open to it. Its great if you are that way, but not everyone is. For me, sex is something that I really have to be ready for or I end up freaking out and crying... Just like he was. The fact that he got upset and clearly has issues around sex (because of being raped and having abusive exes) shows that he moved too quickly for his own comfort. This makes me worry that he isn't good at listening to what HE needs -- this MIGHT mean that in a relationship he spends all his time trying to please his partner at any cost -- which is a personality that attracts the abusive type (hence his experiences, not saying you).   These two red flags tells me he's got a lot of work to do on himself. I'm not sure your ages, so it could just be that he's too young to have realized it, or realized how to do that (therapy).  Someone with his past is not a bad partner, or a lost cause or any of those things. However, someone with his past who isn't willing to do the self work needed, is a poor choice. Which one is he? And are you willing to be part of that journey (its ok to say no).   I know someone said something like "If he's had all these crazy girlfriends, the common denominator is him." I wanted to comment on that -- Yes. it is him. That does NOT mean he's crazy, it does not mean he's a write off (though he may not be right for you, and that's ok). In my case, I was the common denominator as well -- and Ir ealized that it wasn't that I was crazy or asked for it, it simply meant that there was something about my personality that made me an easy target. It was by working on myself, learning to be assertive etc, that I learned to not be a target.
My first hero was my best friend in Kindergarten to 4th grade. He was smart beyond belief and not a lot of people would be friends with him, as he was a little 'off'.   He was the youngest troll I knew, by 1st grade he memorized the keys on a keyboard, and would yank them out and re-arrange them, so the other kids would spell their words wrong every time, in this computer program.   In second grade, he begun to teach me algebra, and the importance of knowing big words, as we would read books and the dictionary together. He would also describe his current science projects he was working on at home.   By third grade he had hacked the school network systems (which was in the days of Dos) and had made us both network administrators. We were called into the principals office (1994-1995 era) and was told him that he wasn't allowed to make anyone else a network account. As they didn't know how to undo what he did, or even how he did it, the only way they could punish him was if someone squealed.   I lost in touch with him when I moved to Italy due to the military, but I recently found him on Facebook. He's now openly gay (that thing that made him a little 'off' with the other kids growing up...never bothered me, still doesn't) and getting his degree in Computer Engineering.

Okay so this probably isn't as important to you as it is me, but what does "TAKE 2 TABLETS ONCE DAILY TIMES 5 DAYS" mean? Take 2 tablets at one time or take 2 tablets a day, but at different times? It's definitely the once that's throwin me off, and it looks weird.
Hi,   I've built an OpenStim and tested it during the last few days. Thank you, ohsnapitsnathan! I think it's really great for a relatively simple DIY one!   I don't really have much experience with and knowledge of electronics (just the basics). Could somebody please help me out by answering one or two of the following questions?   When measuring the current with no electrodes the device can't generate a current lower than ~ .5 mA. I think that's logical because the 10k pot can't reduce it any more (at 5V) if it is the only resistor in that circuit. Is this correct so far?   I've added a 4k7 resistor just for testing and now get around .34 mA and more, but nothing different between .34 and 0. That still makes sense to me. So overall I assume I have assembled everything correctly and it's working as designed.   But this also means that I won't get clean ramping in the lower part with this device and I can't use it for very low currents, like 200 µA. There would be no ramping in this case. Is this simply by design and is the missing beginning of the ramping not a problem in practice?
I met this guy (we'll call him Jordan) in school a few years back. He recently came home on leave from military and we reconnected. He's handsome, kind and I enjoy talking to him overall.   After a month or so of long-distance communication following his leave, I decided to visit him! He's only about 5 hours away, so it wasn't a bad trip. He stayed in a hotel with me for a few days and some things just rubbed me the wrong way.   First, once he met up with me at the hotel he IMMEDIATELY had an erection in the elevator. We got to the room and he was making out with me. Right off the bat, he was trying to have sex with me! It felt rushed, but I was comfortable having sex. I asked if he had a condom (I didn't either, but I wasn't pushing to have sex straight away), and he replied that he didn't as I was on birth control. This made felt funny and kind of presumptuous to me. People who are first starting out don't go without protection, right? He eventually went out to buy condoms and we had intercourse.   Afterwards, we were spooning and chatting. He sort of pat my stomach and was like,"Anything you're insecure about here?". Dude?! I know this might sound petty, but come on. He knows I've been dieting strictly and going to the gym regularly. I don't know if this was just a social blunder or what, but it felt condescending and strange.   The rest of the weekend went by alright. There was a consistent theme of him being a little too touchy, but nothing that made me uncomfortable per se.   Am I looking into this too much? I know it's soon, but i'd rather identify red flags before things become too serious.
I've written about this on reddit before, but I'm going to put it here again because I'm pretty sick of people not understanding how this shit keeps girls out of STEM in fundamental manner:   I took high school computer programming (about 15 years ago now). As you mention, I was the only girl in the class. Did the guys in the class treat me like just another computer programmer? Of course not. I was either to be avoided or to be hit on as much as possible during interactions. Getting a question answered was impossible. In addition, although I didn't notice myself falling behind or really doing anything different than the male candidates, my teacher asked me at least twice "are you really sure this is for you? Wouldn't you rather be doing something else?". It seemed like everyone was personally offended I was taking this course.   In case you're wondering, I didn't bear up to the social awkwardness and pressure the whole situation caused, and I dropped this class halfway through the year (I was 14). Now, I'm returning to finish programming degrees as I prepare for a job change, and I'm experiencing the same thing but from the perspective of an older woman. I'm happy to say it's much less pronounced, and now I have the confidence to tell naysayers to fuck off instead of letting them get in my head. AND I'm happily out of reach of the young fresh-out-of-high-school guys, who are the worst misogynists of the bunch until their empathy grows in.
So this happened 2 days. Me and one of my best friends were chilling by the hardor, except of course, we're not idiots and both very paranoid people.  We sat at the upper part of the harbor instead of right where the ships and boats usually stand. So there was a really big wooden layer underneath us and the water was located about 5 meters away from that. That same day, my boyfriend presented me with the beautiful OnePlus phone, since he knew how much I needed a new smartphone. I was ecstatic! I thanked him a million times and basically felt blessed.  So flash forward to the harbor, me and my friend are having a very heated conversation, she raises her hands and accidentally hits the phone, which falls down to the wooden part but it doesn't exactly stay there...it flippin bounces off of it (since it's a relatively big phone) and falls into the water. Just like that. It just disappears.... Me and my friend are just staring at each other, unable to comprehend what had just happened. I obviously wasn't able to get the original phone back, but I luckily had the chance to replace it with a brand new one (waiting for it in the mail) What a day...
I am unsure I should get the H440, RGB keyboard, or a new G502. I currently own a HAF 912 that won't fit my H100i and am too lazy to mod it. I also want a side panel window. My G502 died so i picked up a Corsair RGB Sabre, but not a huge fan of the plastic construction (M65 is an option). The only problem w/ the G502 is the mouse color scheme is blue and my color scheme is red currently but can be changed easily enough. Then I have a K70 with a busted "0" switch on the number bar that is bugging me (cat broke it).   Any suggestions are appreciated, be it different case, mouse, keyboard, or other piece IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH IT.

I took a sleeping pill, and those make me the weirdest kind of horny. I was stimulating my clit, and I really wanted to try to get a g-spot orgasm. I grab a nearby sharpie and started pushing it against my g-spot. It felt so good, so I started doing that and rubbing my clit simultaneously for double feel good. I was soaking wet. I came quite intensely. I pull out the highlighter and it drips on my face.  Aw yeah my vaginal cum is so hot on my face . Remember, sleeping pills make people weird. Then I turn on the light to see how much I squirted.   It was blood.   It was all blood and cum.   My hands and face were covered in blood, the sharpie is producing a murky brown color, and there was even blood splatter on the walls. I guess I got my period. Whoops.   The worst part is that I got period blood on my dead grandmother's quilt. I sleep with it every night, so that's why it was there in the first place.
This might get buried, but for once I actually do have something to say.   This was a four years back. My friends and I were practicing cricket on our college grounds. I was the wicket keeper(Kind of like a catcher in baseball). So the bowler pitches short and sends the ball way over my head and behind some trees. I went after it and finally found it resting about 30 feet away from me beyond a patch of land bordered (on my side) by thorny bushes.   So, instead of going around the bushes, I decide to jump over them. I land, neck deep in quicksand. For a second, I was lost in shock. Then I remembered what I was told ages ago about how to get off a quicksand. Looked around, found a branch within my reach, slowly reached out to it and dragged myself to the edge and climbed out.   As I sighed a sigh of relief, the smell then hit me. I had jumped into what I can only figure was a bio-gas dump.( I dunno why it wasn't covered yet or why it was there in the first place. All I know was that it was a pit full of shit). By this time, my friends come looking for me, see me like that, and laugh themselves silly. I toss the ball over and make my way back to my room.   Thing is, that meant I had to walk across my college grounds, and then across the campus to the other end, where the hostels were, so everyone saw me neck-deep in shit.   I showered four times that night. The bathroom I showered in stank for 2 days afterward.   I still shudder when I think about it.
Did you even read that? What you posted is wrong. AMD's is AMD64 and Intels is EMT64.   Then I guess Debian has it wrong too.   Linux Spartan 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.60-1+deb7u3 x86_64    That's on an AMD CPU.   Oh, look! Apple has it wrong too:   Darwin pro.local 13.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 13.4.0: Sun Aug 17 19:50:11 PDT 2014; root:xnu-2422.115.4~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64    That's on an Intel CPU.   What's this? [AMD appears to have it wrong as well](   "The x86 Open64 Compiler Suite simplifies and accelerates development and tuning for x86, AMD64 (AMD® x86-64 Architecture), and Intel64 (Intel® x86-64 Architecture) applications."   Wow, all these major computer manufacturers and kernel developers are wrong in  exactly the same way I am!   What are the odds?!   >  But all that is beside the point. x86, or 32 bit, can only address up to 4gb of ram.   Here's Microsoft talking about 32-bit Windows 2000  of random access memory (RAM) by way of the Intel Physical Addressing Extension (PAE) specification. Windows 2000 Advanced Server is limited to 8 GB, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server is limited to 32 GB. You can enable PAE in the Boot.ini file." (steps follow.)   [Here's Microsoft again:](   "Windows 2000 Memory Support. With Windows 2000 Professional and Server, the maximum amount of memory that can be supported is 4 GB (identical to Windows NT 4.0, as described later in this section). However, Windows 2000 Advanced Server supports 8 GB of physical RAM and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server supports 32 GB of physical RAM using the PAE feature of the IA-32 processor family, beginning with Intel Pentium Pro and later."   While  individual applications  running within PAE can only address 4gb of RAM, the OS itself could be made aware of far more despite running on the x86 instruction set.
To everyone complaining about Jesse releasing 70+ episodes of a single game:   May i bring your attention to Tobuscus? He began playing on the same exact day as Jesse and has released a staggering 260+ episodes of the game and is still going. Here's the thing those episodes are extremely shorter (10 minutes each) and argueably of poorer quality and causes waaayyy more but clenching. I mean FFS, Toby got stuck in a death loop by quicksaving right before he died. At least with Jesse, he's giving us quality gameplay along with the humor.
A little bit about me: I played some MTG years back and have a decent collection from those days, returned to playing MTG a few months ago and I'm in love with the Pauper format. Started playing MTGO just to be able to play Pauper whenever I want.   Playing a lot of Pauper in paper and online I noticed a trend that is increasing with Pauper being more and more popular.   T1 Decks and Pauper staples are becoming more expensive online than in paper. This is mostly because some pauper staples that are still really cheap to buy in paper (eg. [[Gorilla Shaman]], [[Hydroblast]], [[Ninja of the Deep Hours]], [[Cuombajj Witches]]) are very expensive online due to the limited supply. This is only in a few rare cases true the other way round and often the cards that make decks expensive online are ones that are still cheap in paper.   I don't think this is a healthy trend for Pauper which has a lot of it's appeal for being a cheap (online) format.   With Pauper being supported by Wizards online I think this is a problem that wouldn't be too hard to fix as it's easier to reprint them in a special set online than in paper.   One idea I came up with is creating Pauper Boosters with 15 commons and offering Sealed Pauper Leagues and Drafts for them. I'm not sure if I'm overlooking something but I think this would be a good way to do some much needed reprints of Pauper staples online.   Interested to hear your opinions on why Pauper gets more and more expensive online and what could be done against it.   I love this format and want it to stay as accessible as possible and open for everyone.
As stated, we've been dating for a hair over 5-months and both love one another; however we are relatively inexperienced (actually, completely inexperienced) and consequently have yet to make any steps whatsoever toward a relationship of a sexual nature.   We have gone little further than making out, and understandably this has resulted in some tension and long discussions. She is reluctant to move forward due to being uncomfortable with the topic, and I respect this. While we have talked about it at length and agreed to "try and break down barriers," I am afraid the process will simply stall, due largely to the fact that she is relatively indifferent to the matter. I also don't want to constantly be the one initiating things, or nagging her to be more open.   What frustrates me is that she expresses quite positive attitudes toward sex, especially in her artwork and discussions with myself and friends. I don't judge her for this dissonance, but I'm terrified of pushing her and due to a complete lack of intimacy for the first few months of our relationship, I'm worried that this simply won't happen at all. I would potentially be okay with a sex-less relationship, but perhaps not happily.   I lose some self respect every time I bring it up, so perhaps Reddit can help with my situation? I will provide any additional or needed information as requested. I'm sorry if this issue seems too vague or trivial for anyone to render assistance, but even general insight or vague advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks.   (Does this belong in /r/sex instead of here? I'm really not sure.)
Every game the enemy jungler lives in the top lane bush and ganks every two minutes, while the other jungler basically doesn't realise the lane exists. Then fast forward 20 minutes in and the ignorant jungler starts flaming the top who lost.   What the hell is wrong with this game? I wanted to play some to see how S3 updates turned out (and I'm fucking loving the changes BTW) and apparently it's impossible, at least top lane.   What are the fucking odds? At least 6 games straight the jungler ignores top completely while the enemy camps it like no tomorrow. Wards down 24/7, doesn't matter the second they go down the jungler comes there or then he appears whenever you go to set down a new ward. The one game I fucking jungle, our ADC disconnects and the top and bot laner start blaming everything bad on the jungler who is 6/1/5 and ganks his balls off while keeping an eye on dragon timers.
Now's my time to shine!   I was single and at a con rave. I'm dancing with a couple of my friends and scanning the area for some man meat to tease for the night. Suddenly, accidentally, I lock eyes with this guy in a cape. No cosplay, just some dark-blue cape. I immediately look away to try to signal I'm not interested. Keep dancing with my friends. Get even a little closer to them maybe.   Nope. Hint not taken. He makes a beeline towards me and starts grinding up on me. I inch myself away and give him an apologetic smile as if to say "I'm sorry I led you on, I'm really not interested."   My good guy friend made his way between us and got the guy off of me and we managed to get lost in the crowd, and cape guy is gone.   A couple minutes later, I feel him grinding up against me again. My good friend gets in-between us again. This time I told cape guy I wasn't interested, and so he buzzes off.   Well, my guy friends had to leave, but I didn't want to leave, so I wandered for a moment or two, trying to find some of my old college friends who were also there. I pull them aside for a second and say "hey, I wanna dance with you guys, but there's this really creepy guy that will not leave me alone. I told him I wasn't interested, but I'm worried he might not have gotten the message."   So, we danced for a good fifteen minutes before suddenly these caped arms close around me and all my friends can do is make [this face]( He starts getting in really close and rubbing his hands all over my face, and finally I push him off of me and tell him to back off, and to seriously, leave me alone.   I left pretty soon after that because I couldn't handle it anymore. A year later, my guy friend sends me a message, asking if I remember the guy. Turns out cape guy was now facing murder charges for some unrelated incident.
precisely. it takes a helluva perspective shift to see the matrix in its true form, and it takes a very strong mind/will to remove oneself from it.  In a sense, it's not unlike people who are raised Catholic, have Catholic values/beliefs instilled into them in childhood, and slowly but surely shed their religious clothing as they see reality more and more through their own eyes.
Honestly, I have to agree with your teammates. Force staff is terrible on Sniper, you might as well get a blink. If it were old force staff, I would say go for it, but it doesn't give the +Dmg or IAS anymore. Personally I can't see any reason to get a force staff in that game anyway unless it was a support forcing you away from Axe, but in general force staff is pretty "eh" against Axe anyway. Just going to throw this out there, but that game was in the "Normal" skill bracket where people don't realize that Sniper is a hero and will ignore him 100% of the time.
Ok. There are some errors with the information in your post.   1)     Dietary and Serum cholesterol are linked. Technically you don’t need to ingest cholesterol. Your body, specifically your liver, makes it anyway. Anyway, the intake of saturated fats and cholesterol via a high-saturated fatty acid and cholesterol-containing diet has been directly linked towards the upregulation of cholesterol found in the bloodstream (   2)     There has been a long established link between cholesterol intake and the development of atherosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis is the hardening of the arteries in general but in this context (of cholesterol being the cause) I’m going to discuss atherosclerosis specifically.   Atherosclerosis Development:   •    Atherosclerosis begins with cholesterol – specifically Low Density Lipoproteins (LDLs), the difference between HDLs and LDLs will be discussed shortly – entering the blood vessel wall. The wall of a blood vessel is composed of 3 layers: (going from innermost to outermost layers) the endothelium/tunica intima, the tunica media (essentially smooth muscle cells) and the adventitia (connective tissue). LDLs squeeze through the spaces in between the cells of the intima via a process known as diapedesis and into the internal elastic lamina (the space between the intima and media). Once there, the LDLs have difficulty escaping. What happens is that one of the lipoproteins composing LDLs (Apolipoprotein B-100) interacts with proteoglycans which are structural proteins that connect cells to one another and so it can’t leave.   •    Once there, LDLs become oxidized. The oxidiation of LDLs is not an entirely understood process as there are many potential causes. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are thought to be a main cause ( These are byproducts of your cells’ ATP producing process known as the electron transport chain which include superoxide (O2^2-) and Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2). Anyway, these oxidize the LDLs which initiates the release of several signaling molecules known as cytokines from the intima into the bloodstream in order to initiate an immune response. Oxidized LDLs if left to their own devices can potentially kill cells or damage cell components such as DNA which could lead to things like cancer. It’s one reason why antioxidants are so heavily marketed nowadays, it’s because they negate oxidizing agents. But keep in mind that your body also produces enzymes such as superoxide dismutase to deal with oxidizing agents.   •    Immune cells known as monocytes come into the internal elastic lamina to take care of the oxidized LDLs. Once inside, Monocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) causes monocytes to differentiate into macrophages which now engulf the LDLs. While they’re doing this, more cytokines are being released to increase monocyte recruitment.   •    As macrophages become full with oxidized LDLs, they get stuck. Foam cells do secrete ApoE which helps recruit HDLs who then take out some of the cholesterol. However, eventually the foam cells die leading to a necrotic center and eventually a plaque.   •    Now, over time plaques like this begin to form and grow due to the buildup of smooth muscle cells and structural proteins around the plaque to prevent it from bursting and causing an embolism. Oxidized LDLs also prevent the production of Nitrous Oxide which your blood vessels use to cause vasodilation (the relaxing and widening of blood vessels). These two factors combine to cause arteriosclerosis, the hardening of blood vessels and one of the hallmarks of coronary artery disease.   I’ll be honest, I didn’t look through all of the links that you included in your post, but I’ve never heard of cholesterol having a healing effect on arteries. One important role cholesterol does play is in maintaining the fluidity of cell membranes. However, that doesn’t really come into play when it comes towards atherosclerosis development.   3)     You are correct that HDLs and LDLs are not cholesterol and they do transport it in the blood stream. High Density Lipoprotein and Low Density Lipoproteins are both two mechanisms for carrying cholesterol and something every person hears about in the news on a regular basis or on food labels. The density refers to the ratio of proteins and lipids in the molecule. There’s not really a set proportions differentiating the types of LDLs, more a general guideline which basically divides them somewhat arbitrarily based on their relative concentrations of lipids and proteins. In general, you have VLDLs, IDLs, LDLs, and HDLs (very low/intermediate/low/high).   When cholesterol leaves the liver, it’s packaged in VLDLs which then deposit their holdings to your body’s cells as it travels along. The further it goes, the smaller it gets. The reason why LDLs can get into the internal elastic lamina to begin with is because of their smaller size. So indirectly, cholesterol causes atherosclerosis. But since it's only really moved in the body via these LDLs/HDLs for the sake of this discussion they are synonymous in effect.   HDLs are helpful. They carry cholesterol away from arteries and also help transport paraoxonase, an antioxidant, to arteries. Paraoxonase is capable of degrading oxidized phospholipids such as oxidized LDL.   4)     Saying that people eating lots of carbs, getting high blood glucose levels as a result and then arterial inflammation is a somewhat incomplete statement.   Yes, chronic high blood glucose levels can exacerbate oxidative stress on cells and lead to atherosclerosis. HOWEVER, this kind of high blood glucose is due to the insulin resistance characterized by type 2 diabetes as opposed to someone who eats a lot of pasta on a regular basis. It’s not entirely clear what causes insulin resistance. There are many factors involved, both genetic and acquired. One major one that has been suggested has been the circulation of free fatty acids derived from fat cells. ( For background information: insulin is a hormone produced by the islet cells of the pancreas. It flows into the bloodstream when your body detects that there are higher than normal levels of glucose (typically after eating and digesting something). Cells sense the insulin and proceed to increase the incorporation of GLUT 4 receptors into their cell membranes which allow them to transport glucose from the bloodstream into the cell. Insulin has some other effects such as the prevention of lipolysis but its primary function is this GLUT4 receptor expression (and if you think about it, it makes sense. Your body doesn’t want to burn fat it doesn’t need to. Why allow fat to be broken down when your body is about to use glucose anyway?).   When your body becomes insulin resistant it means that your cells have difficulty/cannot detect it and thus you can’t take glucose from the blood as easily resulting in high blood glucose levels. So having high blood glucose levels WILL NOT lead to arterial inflammation if you are a normal person with a normal diet. LDLs DO NOT become oxidized SOLELY BECAUSE of high blood glucose levels.  If you are at the point where you develop type 2 diabetes there are bigger problems to be addressed than simply having a diet with high amounts of carbohydrates.   5)     Yes, a low fat diet will lower the amount of HDL in your body and will raise fasting levels of triglycerides which, frankly, brings up a really important point I’ll get to in a second. Anyway, in terms of having healthy levels of HDLs and LDLs, the composition of the cholesterol and fats you have in your diet is more important than the overall levels. The cited study specifically emphasizes the replacement of saturated and trans fats with unhydrogenated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.(   In Summary:  High carb diets are not a direct cause of atherosclerosis. Low carb high fat diets will lower your blood glucose levels but will simultaneously increase your risk of heart disease. Eating bacon will not kill you. Only eating bacon – along with nutritional deprivation – will increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis, increasing your risk of getting a heart attack or stroke which in turn will kill you or at least potentially lead to long lasting damage. The important thing to take from all of this is that your body needs balance to be healthy. Only eating sugar is not good for you but that doesn’t mean that only eating fat is the solution (I’m not claiming that that’s what the keto diet is, I’m just using that as hyperbole). It’s good that you’ve decided to take control of your body and health and that you’re trying to find the best solution to be as healthy as we all should. However, it’s crucial to remember that THERE IS NOT MAGIC BULLET. The keto diet may work for you and it may not, the same goes for any other kind of diet regime. We’re all a little bit different and thus our environment affects us in different ways. The important thing is balance. There are some fundamentals that we can all agree on. You need exercise. You need a balanced diet free of excess from one particular food group (I’m talking broad spectrum: carbs, fats, etc. obviously ingesting trans fats or saturated fats in excess is bad for you). If you’re trying to lose weight you need a caloric deficit to do so. Take everything into account and stick with what is working for you. Most importantly, don’t give up.
I realised not too long ago that I was privy to two different sides of the fat logic process, and I thought FPS might be interested in hearing them.   Story one: a friend of mine got fat. Like BMI of 43-45. He didn't try and hide how much he ate, but he explained that he never got that feeling of being "full", and would just keep on eating.   He had a sticker on his car which entitled him to a free cheese burger at the fast food joint. He would drive past said establishment to and from his GF's house. As such, he would get two cheeseburgers every time he saw his GF. He saw her at least once per day. At least. Another time I was helping him with some work at his office, in three hours he knocked back three cans of soft drink. This appeared to be normal.   After a lot of cajoling from friends and family, he underwent stomach stapling (I think). He has stuck to his diet, he exercises daily, and his BMI is probably better than mine (he would be around 30 I guess).   I think he is gonna make it.   Story two: while on holiday recently in South Asia, we walked back to our hotel to find possibly the largest woman I had ever seen in a bathing tent. The usual term is bathing suit, but I feel it does not adequately describe the increase in worldwide textile demand caused when this garment was produced. She was about 5'9, and I would suppose around 350+ pounds? I honestly don't know, all I can do is relate it to a cow or a pig, as that is as far as my large animal experience extends. I shall call her WB, short for Wildebeest, as its my story and I want to.   Her husband said hello to my wife and I, and we all got chatting about where we had been, where to eat, etc. They seemed like nice enough people, Ill try and not judge on outward appearances and all that jazz.  We recommended a place that we had just dined at, and invited them to share a taxi to another area the next day.   During said taxi ride, WB told us that she had recently had the same surgery as in story #1. We complimented her, and asked how it was going. WB mentioned she had already lost 30 pounds in the first six weeks or so (my brain stopped while trying to work out what WB would have looked like with another thirty pounds).   WB then told Wifey and I about this excellent little card she got that allowed her to get a smaller portion of food due to medical reasons. It turned out that when she goes to Crack in the Box, she can get a small shake and burger, instead of the full sized one. But the can't eat much at a time, so she goes there more often. Like up to four or five times a day.   Wifey and I looked at each other with confused looks. My brain was thinking: but, I thought, doesn't that mean....but it doesn't work that...I don't think you....I got nothing.   I don't think she is gonna make it.
My great grandfather was an Australian who ran away from home as a teenager, and worked on a boat for several years. Then World War 1 broke out, and since he was in Ireland at the time, he lied about his age and joined the North Irish Horse. He fought WWI on horseback. Coming out of that alive, and heavily decorated, he brought his horse back to Australia, and began entering riding competitions, and won several ribbons. Then, WWII rolled along, and because he obviously hadn't seen enough war, he lied about his age again, and joined the ANZAC troops, fighting as a foot soldier. Then he popped home and lived quite nicely for another 30 some-odd years.
Alright, so, there's [this post]( over on TRP. And, unsurprisingly, there's a lot of advice saying that it's totally okay for that professor to date the student when she's no longer  his  student. As a student who has been down this path, I'd like to drop some wisdom on all y'all pillers of every color reading this.   When I was in undergrad, I was friends with a bunch of upperclassmen and a handful of alumni and grad students. One of the grad students was kind enough to set me up doing the catering for the graduate student mixer club. It was at their end of year event, my freshman year, that I met Greg, who, it turned out, was  Professor  Greg Glitter ^^^obviously ^^^I ^^^changed ^^^his ^^^name, ^^^but ^^^if ^^^you ^^^knew ^^^his ^^^real ^^^name ^^^you'd ^^^know ^^^how ^^^funny ^^^this ^^^is.   ANYWAY, Greg and I were talking quite a bit at the mixer. I mean, all I had to do was show up with the food I cooked and they let me hang out for the party - problem being all my friends were busy running the damn thing. So, yeah, at some point somebody had introduced me to Greg during a natural conversation and they kind of wandered off and we wound up talking all night.   He was interesting, actually. Very intellectually stimulating. But, of course he was! I was 18 freaking years old and he was a goddamn PhD candidate/Professor. Anyway, at some point I mentioned what courses I was taking and he looked pretty taken aback. He was 27. I think the age difference kind of threw him for a loop. I mean, I guess he had assumed I was a grad student too, because that would make sense. Okay, no harm no foul.   We kept talking, decided to hang out another time, since the party was over and whatnot. Traded numbers. Yadda yadda.   Well, I had just gotten my transfer acceptance to a different university several states away and decided to go there instead. I assessed that it would be cool to be friends with Greg, so we kept hanging out outside of school sponsored events, as I was no longer a student at the university and neither of us thought it would be a problem.   He eventually asked me out. I hesitantly accepted. Decent time. I called the whole thing off as I was moving a couple thousand miles away pretty soon. He decided to start showing up at places I was hanging out with my friends. Places I'd not told people I would be. Places I'd not posted about online. Freaky shit. But, being impressionable, he convinced me we should keep in touch after I moved, no big deal. Then I decided I'd made a mistake changing schools and I wanted to go back to the one I started at. When I told Greg of my decision, he immediately started talking about how we could be together. I told him, no, I didn't think so. After all, I was going to be a student at the university where he taught.   He began trying to convince me, telling me how so long as I wasn't  his  student, it would be okay. How it was totally fine because some mutual friends of ours (female student, male professor) had started dating and were now engaged. Difference is, when they had started dating she was a senior, not a sophomore. And they were quiet about it because they're not stupid. Now, I'm not saying I approve of what those two did, but they're married now and happy, so whatever. THE POINT is that Greg was insisting that just because these two did it we could too. Well, at my university, in the core curriculum, there are two tracks you can choose to take. Greg taught Track A, and I had opted for Track B. So he was insisting that that meant he would never be in a position of power over me so the code of conduct CLEARLY wasn't talking about us. We could TOTALLY be together, no worries.   I was extremely uncomfortable, to say the least. Not only did I find it highly unethical for a student at an institution to be dating a teacher, regardless of whether there was a direct relationship or not, I was really freaked the fuck out that "I don't want to, Greg," was not a good enough reason for him.   He wrote me poetry; he called at odd hours; he left threatening voicemails and emails saying how he loved me and he cared about me more than anyone else in my life, including my family, and knew what was best for me; he told me, if I didn't do what he wanted, he would  end  my academic career.   So I went to the President of the University and presented all that evidence and told them I didn't want to be around a freaking  stalker . I didn't feel safe. Now, I won't bore you with specifics, because that's a whole other story and this is WAY too long already, but they let him stay on so long as neither of us spoke to the other. Okay, whatever.   Except not whatever. Imagine my surprise when I got back to uni and Professor Glitter ^^^snigger ^^^I'm ^^^sorry ^^^I ^^^couldn't ^^^resist was now teaching in Track B. A course that I needed to graduate. A course that I needed as a pre-req for OTHER courses I needed to graduate. Technically, dude wasn't breaking the agreement with the administration. Anyway, I waited til senior year then raised hell about how either he would be removed from teaching the course or I would not be required to take it for graduation, because I was NOT going to be taking a course with my freaking stalker. And he got removed from the course. And I graduated on time.   Because THAT is what ACTUALLY happens when you tell a smart girl that it's okay to date because you're not  her  teacher. Technicalities don't mean shit when ethics are involved.
Preface: I love Gnar. Everything about him. He's fun, interesting, mechanics focused and cute as hell. I don't know where and who to explain this to so I'm hoping this gets seen here.   Dear denizens of Riot/Reddit, please hear me out. Gnar's passive, Q and R are still in need of some fine tuning. The interaction of these abilities with champions and walls alike is making the champion a lot harder to play effectively.   Please Riot, I'd ask you to do the following.     Gnar's Passive NEEDS some sort of leniency.     I'm having this repeat issue where either I'm trying to cast an ability in Mini form and cast the Mega Version when I'm at 99 rage and it's about to tick over -OR- when I'm about to come out of Mega Form and trying to cast an ability, it casts the Mini version if I have roughly 5-10 rage left. This USUALLY winds up with me casting Crunch but, midjump, I turn into Mini Gnar and HOP right under the turret, where I can get locked up and killed instantly. Can there be some sort of leniency for this? Since we know you can't let us manually change forms, can you PLEASE give Gnar something that lets it flow better?     Revisit the hitbox for Q.     I've had various instances where I'm standing perfectly in line to catch the Boomerang and it goes right through me. And it still tries to go towards thick walls on random occasions too, making it impossible to catch. On top of this, trying to cast Q while hopping (E) makes the hitbox go haywire, usually making it go in the opposite direction, or casting into the unit you hopped over.   Mega Gnar's Q has some weird interactions when it comes to terrain, getting stuck in some but not others. Also the back of the hitbox still catches on minions if you're about a minions width ahead of the unit. The most annoying part though is that if it's max range and it lands within the hitbox, it'll land, do the animation, but zero damage.     Revisit the hitbox for R, and give MiniGnar R something useful in general?     The movespeed passive for MiniGnar's R is barely noticeable early game, and doesn't seem to benefit his kit until he hits level 11, where the gain is large enough to allow you to chase most ADCs.   The MegaGnar R, has it's own share of problems. The directional cast tootlip doesn't seem to want to work with you when you try to cast it on diagonal angle, which in turn, leads to very bad ultimates when on the move. However that's not my pet peave with this ability. There's 2 other giant problems.   This one MIGHT be solved with the new SR Update: If you cast towards a wall with curves or a slope, there is a 50/50 chance that some champions will actually go through the wall and take no damage. This also happens on broken turrets sometimes.   The other problem is that at max range, some champions hit the wall, get the animation, but take no damage and don't get stunned. Nothing quite like watching an ADC jump away after that happening. Almost makes you wish you could channel your IRL rage back into the rage gene. >_<
Well, to summarize this for you...  this question makes me feel like I'm line dancing in a mine field. Reddit tends to break out the pitch forks if someone sneezes at the wrong time so speaking my mind is dangerous.   My honest opinion is I have never bought into the whole Diacetyl scare. I am not a chemist, and I will not get into any debate over safe levels of what is in anything. All I can state is what I know to be true as far as what people have told us.   Is there Diacetyl in our juice line. No.   Is there Acetoin in our juice line. Probably. As far as I know almost all flavors have trace amounts.   Will I have our line tested. No. Other companies have had them tested. We see the tests come back negative and people wanting it tested for MORE things. We've also seen test results with two completely different results from the exact same batch. So, testing is inconclusive and inaccurate besides being very expensive.   I did do the math once to be able to picture in my head what 1PPB is, which is a common number that I see people referring to. It is a 10,000 gallon pool (a typical backyard pool is 5,000 gallons, so it would be two full swimming pools.)  Put one drop of water into it. That drop is the one part per billion that we are talking about. Now you talk about acetoin being .01% of 1 ppb and you have that drop divided by 100. (Please do not take my math as fact, it was derived from 30 drops per ml, then scaled up using excel. It is as factual as that.)   So we are testing the pool for that drop. That's why the numbers are all off on all the tests. It is such an incredible small amount.   The scare over Diacetyl isn't anything new. There is a new wave every 3 months or so. The reality is a lot less scary than it seems. I absolutely believe you inhale more carcinogens by walking on the sidewalk next to a busy street, or even by being in an office when someone makes a bag of popcorn in the microwave. We've been inhaling THAT for years thinking "Ooooh, that smells yummy!".   So, there is my public stance, make of it what you will. I believe the flavoring to be safe or I wouldn't be making it.  And for those that are afraid to inhale chemicals I would ask to please not vape. Inhaling any foreign matter be it smoke or vapor, car exhaust or smog is worse for you than a walk in the country with clean fresh air. I am all for people vaping to quit smoking, and then gradually quit vaping. It can't be stressed enough that this is a healthier alternative to smoking, not a healthy habit to start.
heres]( an article on high turnover rate. [Heres]( another article. According to [Matt Damon]( 62 percent of teachers have second jobs. He also talks extensively about turnover rate, and how badly teachers want to teach but can't afford it because of the pay. Most of the teachers I had worked summer jobs.   In addition, in some states, like my state of MA, we are required to get our masters after by year X of our career, and have to finance it ourselves. That puts us further in debt. Now, in regards to what teachers get paid, theres a few major points. The average salary for teachers in MA is around 66K. However, at the bottom the salary is only 38k according to the National Education Association. Then you look at other states like North Dakota, Arizona, or Oklahoma, where the starting salary is as low as 25K, again according to the NEA. Now, according to the  census . This says nothing of car insurance, energy costs, the cost of buying supplies for school, for your kids, clothes, and everything else. Just going by those two numbers, and looking at the average starting salaries, what becomes clear is that once all the cost is calculated, teachers get paid enough to get by. They are not living high on the hog. Then, you want to cut their salaries? The cost of living is so high they wouldn't be able to afford anything, and then to toss in this X factor, people are talking extending the school year, which means teachers may not be able to work that second job. So, all of this means what exactly?   What I said before. Cutting salaries will only mean that less talented people want to be teachers, making the state of education even worse, raising the turnover rate, and hurting the teachers just starting out. I am training to be a teacher. I eat, breathe, and sleep this stuff man. i know what I am talking about because I study it. EVERY DAY. I just didn't want to go into a longwinded answer.   Theres one other thing youre forgetting. Teachers are part of the professions. Other professions get paid way more. Teachers work an average of 70 hours a week (according to Matt Damon's Documentary  The American Teacher . Teachers are underpaid, if anything.   To prevent an economic downturn, one of the things that is critical is to have a strong middle class. To have a strong middle class, you need a strong educational system. Now, spending money on education in large chunks isnt the answer. its spending effectively. Cutting spending isn't the answer. education isn't like other institutions. You can't base its purposes off money when it provides so many other things for the country.   What we really need is more schools to disperse the student population, allowing teachers to work more effectively.
Really depends on what you find fun. I know some people who religiously play United every single FM game. He's a United fan since he was a boy, (early 20s now), and he simply wants to make United the best in the world.   For me, pre-takeover, I religiously played City as a Championship or mid to low Premier League team. Once they got taken over, and had a huge transfer chest, I stopped playing them. As much as they are my team that I've followed for years, the fun wasn't there.   On FM 12, which I've not played enough of, I've started with Everton and Newcastle games. Good teams that I can take forward without having a gaping blackhole of money to throw around.   I have a friend that picks a conference team every year, and takes them to the Champions League if he can. He loves doing those little teams you have no idea even existed, though I don't think I'd enjoy doing that. (I have done a few Bury FC games, as my lower league local team, but that's about it.)
My girlfriend and I have been 'official' for about four months now, although we had an open relationship for a much longer time (about two years).   I love my girlfriend very much. I love being around her because she's one of the most enjoyable people I know. But being 3000 miles away is slowly chipping away at me. Before we made it official, we were in an 'unlabeled' relationship. Whenever I would go home (every six months or so) we would be inseparable, but when we were away it was basically just a 'best friend' relationship, although more on the romantic side: We celebrate each other's birthdays and accomplishments, buy each other gifts, call each other pet names like 'honey' and 'babe'. We were basically dating without the label and distance.   My last real relationship ended in 2011, and it was horrible enough that I have commitment issues. I would love for her to move to the east coast but her job and family commitments are holding her back, to which I believe is for the better -- her job pays very well but is only in Las Vegas. And I'm contracted to be in the east coast for about three more years.   I've asked my friends for advice, and it was basically 50/50. One side said, 'if you love her, then deal with it.' The other side said, 'you never know how it's gonna end up, and you're only putting yourself through this mental torture with the risk of having nothing in the end.'   It meant a lot to her when we made our relationship official, but it's slowly turning to my nightmare scenario-- she's going out of her way to do things for me because she's my girlfriend and I'm her boyfriend. I want her to live her life and tell me about it over the phone at night, not plan trips around my schedule. I make a lot more money than she does, with a job that's a lot more flexible, and it's making me uncomfortable when she's making all these job and financial sacrifices for me. Our lives cross when I go home. That's what I want.   But a relationship isn't about what I want anymore, right? It's about compromise.   ..so what do I do?
I just need to get the experience off my chest:   Jury selection took three agonizing days. Each day my chances grew higher and higher that I would get selected as the remaining pool of candidates dwindled. My co-worker and my manager were on the edge of their seats too because what happened to me would affect them too.   On the first day of the process, I actually remember thinking it was actually kind of interesting, if not a bit slow. I never saw the selection of a jury before and was learning as it went along.   All was well until I witnessed the first round of jurors getting peremptorily excused. This is when I had a terrible sinking feeling and realized, "Oh shit, this is all a game and anyone who is quiet and honest is going to get royally screwed."   And for sure, after that point, once people in the audience saw what they had to say to get excused off the jury, then when they were called up into the stands, many of them were all suddenly singing the same, sour tunes.   Once it "slipped out" by the defense that suicide would be playing a part in the trial, all of a sudden people looked relieved if they knew someone who killed themselves at one point and couldn't wait to bring it up - another free pass there. Attempted suicides were fair game, too, the more attempts the merrier.   And boy, fuck diversity and unity because if racism will get you off a jury, you bet suddenly everyone's a little bit racist and they're no longer too shy to admit it.   One big guy said he couldn't promise to be fair if he saw even a bit of blood. He was also racist, too, just in case.   In contrast: one older guy, randomly selected in the very first round, never found his way off the jury. He was calm, even though it was obvious he wasn't happy about being there. During a recess, I heard him talking on the phone. I couldn't hear what was being said to him, but probably something like, "You have to say something that will get you excused!" His reply: "There's a process of justice going on here here, and I just want to be fair, to give the attorneys a chance to evaluate me. Hey, we'll see what happens."   Nice, genuine man, I wanted to shake his hand and be his friend immediately - and at the same time, I knew at that point he was a goner; he was going to serve.   The worst part, the detail that makes me froth at the mouth and floods my body with stress recalling it even now, is that more than a handful of very willing, qualified, intelligent candidates were let go. They all had experience that would help them make informed decisions on the case - people who worked in or around law, medicine, and crime scenes - and they all promised to be unbiased and fair. All sent home, by the defense, of course - on your way, thanks for your time, don't let the door hit you on the way out.   Before jury duty selection, the judge told us, "You know, I get summoned for jury duty every year and I always show up." Easy enough to do when you'll never get put on a jury. We all have an equal chance of serving, my ass.
Well....I'd like to see your legs for days. Have any photos you'd like to send me? :)   So, USS Nimitz (CVN-68) - July 1987. We stopped in Rio for a week of Liberty, after a long time at sea. The beaches were stormed like nothing seen since Omaha, Gold, and Juno. The debauchery...Oh, the debauchery. And gunshots. And assaults. And International Incidents.   When our Carrier Battle Group pulled out 7 days later, the entire U.S. Navy was persona non grata in Brazil. I think, to this day, they still are.   As far as Costco, well...I was down on my luck after a divorce. I finally landed a job. I hated every second of it, but I needed to keep it. On the way home one night, a threadbare tire blew. I knew the others weren't far behind. So, the next day, I went to Costco and had 4 news ones put on my car. I wrote them a check. Actually, I  floated  them a check. I knew I didn't have the money, but I needed to get to work, and I was getting paid in a couple days. I really intended to make good on it. Then other bills came in, and it got away from me. One day, I get a Notice To Appear in the mail. Fuck....   I went to court, the judge had me pay what I owed ($568.00), and the charges were dropped. I'm not welcome there anymore.
Resistances don't have diminishing returns.   Let's take simple numbers.   You have 1000HP and 0 Armor. This translates to 1000 Effective HP against physical damage.   Let's add 100 Armor for a 50% damage reduction against physcial attacks. Opponent's physical damage is reduced by half against you, so now you have 2000 effective HP against physical damage.   Let's add another 100 Armor for a total of 200 Armor. This reduces physical damage by 66%. Opponents damage is reduced by 66% (he deals only one third of damage he would deal if you had 0 Armor) This increases your effective HP to 3000.   The previous 100 Armor you added and the next increased your EHP by exactly the same amount. No diminishing returns.
I own a gun because I like to go to the shooting range occasionally. If you've never been to a range it's hard to describe. I know I'm going to get murdered by some anti-gun nut but you get a thrill out of firing a gun similar to riding a roller coaster. I find the people that are against guns don't really have valid reasons why, or they make extreme stereotypes about gun owners. Obviously for somebody to own a gun they have to take safety seriously and take care to train anybody that they allow to use their firearm.
Not all libertarians are ancaps. That said, CATO has its good share these days (Aaron Ross Powell and David Boaz are two that come to mind).   Fun fact, Murray Rothbard was a founder of the CATO Institute and the guy who thought of naming it after Cato's letters.   I use to be a huge fan of the Mises Institue, but then I sort of actually began reading Mises, Menger, and Hayek along with more recognizable economists outside of libertarian circles. On top of that, I realized people like Walter Block, Lew Rockwell, Thomas Woods, and Robert Murphy were all asshats who had some questionable views and backgrounds in terms of race relations. I'd toss DiLorenzo in there, but I've had enough discussion about the Confederacy and succession in my Twitter feed over the past week for one lifetime (fucking Jack Hunter fucking things up. fuck.).
It all started with a Carnation Instant Breakfast.   Throughout my childhood my parents demanded I drink milk for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. I used to have terrible stomach pains growing up and spent a lot of time in the bathroom reading whatever I could reach from the toilet. My parents never put deuce-and-deuce together and honestly I didn't until I was in my late teens that I was lactose intolerant.   So yeah, one morning in 5th grade I chugged down an Instant Breakfast. Vanilla was the only flavor left in the multi-flavor pack, so I was off to a bad start. I go to class and the 'sweats' started early on. I was used to it though, and could fight my way through a few 'waves' before I felt nauseous enough where I would have to go spill my bowels. It's about an hour or two in and I had to go. I ask the teacher if I could use a bathroom pass to go, and she said "no". I tell her I really need to go, but she was a cunt that hated men and took it out on every boy in class. I go back to my seat and go through about an hour of clenching through each 'wave' where I thought I was going to either barf on my desk or my balloon knot was going to burst all over the classroom. Finally, my teacher seeing me in agony for that long finally says, "You can go, but come right back."   I shuffle as fast as I can down the hallway into the bathroom. As I got closer to the bathroom my brain already started sending signals to my loins excited about the big moment, which made the walk that much worse. Luckily the bathroom is completely empty and I enter the first stall. I fumble with the lock on the door to make sure it is secure, realize I have no time to mummify the seat with paper, and turn around for my moment of relief. As I pull down my drawers I'm about at a 45 degree angle from sitting down and  BOOM . It was so loud and so quick that I had no idea what happened other than the euphoric sense that I exorcised the demon from my rectum. I turn around expecting most of it to be in the toilet and it was one of the worst scenes I have ever witnessed. The back tile wall, the sides of the stall, the toilet, the floor, the old metal pipes...everything behind me was covered in speckles of shit. It was like someone put a gun to my intestines and murdered my asshole.   I didn't know what to do and fearing someone would walk in, I grabbed a wad of toilet paper, wiped my ass and got the fuck out of there. Somehow, miraculously...no remnants of it were anywhere on my body or cloths.   I get back to class and general relief of everything (finally going and not getting caught) made me suddenly get the giggles. I just kept thinking about that disgusting scene now permanently tattooed into my brain. A friend of mine sees me holding back laughter and asks "What?" and I tell him, "Go look at the stall in the bathroom."   Fast forward 5 minutes and he comes back. He's laughing so hard that his face is blood red and he's audible to the whole class. The teacher is furious at this point and grabs his arm and takes him out in the hall. I hear him laughing and mentioning the bathroom, and then I hear their voices trail off. The teacher comes back in a few minutes later but not my friend. My friend was spending the next hour cleaning MY shit off of the walls, toilet, floor, pipes...because the teacher thought it was him. Plus, I never fessed up to the poor guy and that was back in 1986.
So this whole One Million Moms thing is an attempt by conservatives and homophobes to voice their anger at cultural acceptance of homosexuality by a major American corporation, right?   So why doesn't someone just make "Two Million Moms" in support of Ellen/JC Penny, and try to get more Facebook users/likes, organize a campaign to call JC Penny and tell them they support them, etc? All we need to do is counteract all the negative stuff/publicity OMM is doing, and try to do it all louder, better, and in greater numbers.   It shouldn't even be that hard, especially if we got something like this frontpaged on Reddit and other websites.  The only reason OMM has as much support as it does is press, since even websites like Reddit are posting stories about it - I'd never have even heard of them if not for Reddit, which unfortunately means plenty of people who support their cause/hate have also heard of them.
I'm a cheap asshole. I always buy the cheapest products. Except for TP.  I buy the best, fluffiest, softest, most layered TP I can find.
Several mutations might be done for that code: int foo(int x) return x+x; int foo(int x) return x-x; int foo(int x) return x/x; The first one will still pass, while the second and third should be successfully killed by the unit test. You would then have to write at least one other unit test to kill the first.   And that is a problem. Now we've got two passing tests, 100% coverage and implementation that violates the contract for most possible inputs. I mean whole idea of writing tests to maximize coverage metric seems wrong to me, you'll get a lot of tests, that you have to maintain, but little information about implementation. Actually, this approach gives zero information about implementation, so it's kind of wrong to declare that it helps to catch bugs, it doesn't. What it really does well is assessing quality of your unit tests, which is important.
To answer your question: Uranium metal is what's mostly used in the Nuclear industry as fuel. Assuming the sample had enough rebound energy to actually lift up off of potential dampeners there would probably be some resounding tone generated. I'm not sure the resonance would be audible or even sound *like what Goering has described, but it would be there.   Goering was staunchly anti-Nuclear at the time of the creation of the Simpsons, and I believe a member of Greenpeace (proliferators of the  peace sign . I bring this up only to point out the President of Greenpeace at the time has come out in favor of peaceful nuclear energy, though the organization he created has not.   Full disclosure I support nuclear power within peaceful contexts and uses.
Got 1/2 way through this thread all about dogs and cats and realized I had one with another species. :) I had just moved to a new town. New town to my old town was windy crazy back roads with trees near the edges. (The short cut). This one part of the road I knew was weird... a pinch point. Two huge trees right basically cutting off 25-30% of the roads footprint. Also! it sloped up to the two trees on either side so you couldnt see what was coming at all.   Youd look at this and say wow dangerous except the road was 20mph. I didnt really know the road well but it didnt matter. My mom and I are driving along that road at night and a deer comes out... slowly walks out into the middle of the road.  So we slow down. female deer stares at us. Pauses for a 3 count, then contines walking slowly across the narrow road into the woods.   We think weird! Beautiful... we get going. Mom says take it easy we dont want to hit one... less than 10 seconds later we get to the pinch point and a nissan armada comes flying through doing at least 50.  It came so close to hitting us. (honda civic) We were just 30-50 or so yards from the pinch point and the wind from the armada really shook our car as it passed by us. Woof.   Moms maintains to this day it was my grandmother protecting us since she had just died.  I pretty much believe it. We were freaked out for days.
Um I thought the same thing when I dated my first Asian girl, but I ended up breaking up with her because of jealously. every friend I had of the opposite sex she would get in a bitch fit and ask so many questions. We only dated for 4 months but the 1st month in she was already saying I love you I never said it back because it was way to soon for that. The girl was awesome and always full of surprises. But this girl had a serious case of bipolar. She would keep texting me nonstop and want to hang out and would never let me have time to myself especially to do homework for class. Well I could go on but I think this shall do for now lol
I've told this story before, but here goes: Girlfriend and I both moved out of our parents houses into the dorms, her into a freshly re-modeled suite with air conditioning, me into a horribad shithole building that had high-speed internet (our priorities were somewhat different).   Her roommates moved in the same day, mine hadn't arrived yet, so we were enjoying some privacy and started getting into it. Hadn't even taken off our clothes and she's on top of me makin' out and whatnot, she sits up straight to take her shirt off and kind of raises up off me just as I thrust upward to adjust my position...   ...somehow I managed to drive her, head first, into the concrete block wall behind the bed. She slumps over on top of me, unconscious, half-shirtless. I ask her if she's alright, no response, I shake her, finally she comes to after 10-15 seconds, with no idea where she is or what's going on.   I explain it all to her, she's got a small cut on her forehead right on her hairline and a throbbing headache. No hard feelings over it, but it definitely killed the mood.
First of all, i'd like to apologize about my english, it's my 3rd language.   This afternoon, i was waiting for my girlfriend on a bench in a park. I was a bit sooner, so i had to wait for something like 10 minutes. I asked to see her because after 4 months of love (and i still love her), i wanted to break up with her. Why ? it's pretty complicated, i'm kind of emotional, and she is pretty extroverted, so the fact that she was close from many guys bothered me. But i didn't want her to stop being friendly with everyone. I suffer from that for the past 4 months, and i decided that i wanted it to stop. So i asked her if we could meet. During this 10 minutes, an old-man who had a walk, came to me and said : " Are you waiting for your girlfriend ?" ; i simply answered with a "yes". Then he started talking about womans. He told me that today's woman are exactly the same as they were when he were younger and stuff like that. Even if I didn't say anything about my plans on breaking-up, I believe that he understood what was happening with me and my GF and told me before leaving :   "  Life is good, you have to take it as it comes  ; good luck young boy ; see you tomorrow"   A few seconds after he left, I had one of the biggest smile on my face, I was happy, even if I was fucking destroyed by that fact that I'll quit my GF a few minutes after.   I don't even know him, I still don't understand why did he say "see you tomorrow", but I think I'll try to catch him tomorrow at he same place and thanks him.   P.S : I broke-up with her. And i feel sad right now.
Hi guys,   So this isn't your typical r/ems post and it may even be a silly post but I really need some advice. I'm a NREMT and was just hired on by AMR. I passed their pre employment tests, drug test, physical etc.   Orientation is due to start on the 13th of this month and the only thing between me and the job now is taking the protocol test.  I'm scheduled to take the test on the 7th as that's the earliest they can get me in. I've been studying the protocols since I was told I'd be hired on and am feel like I have a hang of them as far as being a basic goes.   Here's the thing..I have a current job that's non ems and I've been with them for 1 1/2 years. They have no clue I've been hired on and plan to leave.   I haven't told them yet because I'm nervous about this protocols test. I get really worked up about these things. In the protocol manual there's like a flow chart of list of steps to take per provider level, etc and I don't know how that will translate into the protocol test I'll be taking next week.   So because of this I haven't told me job I'm leaving. I don't want to take the test, fail it for some reason (just me being negative here) and then have already quit my job and be left with no job.   Now if I pass the protocol test I'm in with AMR and start orientation the following Monday.. Meaning I'll have to quit my current job within 2-3 days.  I am not the type of person to just quit with little notice like that. Usually I'd give the full two weeks, etc and so I'm torn.
Very well actually. I was just afraid. Have you ever felt alone. I mean you're surrounded by people everywhere you go but at the same time you're as alone as anyone can ever be? That's how I felt. Now think of a teenaged boy, completely alone in a life where nothing seemed to be going according to plan. I don't know how many times I considered ending it. The first time I did, I cut my wrist. I wanted to do it really deep, maybe even end it, but as I was going through it, it kind of made me think rationally, straight. I realised I didn't actually want life to end just yet, but as the physical pain had indeed distracted me I continued to do it for a year. I haven't done it for a year and a bit now and thank god I didn't end it because my life right now is much much better.   (sorry for the long message,
I'm 21 and she's 18. My girlfriend and I started our relationship as a long distance one. But not too far, just 2.5hrs away from each other. Everything seemed to be going fine. Until a year and a half into the relationship. She met up with an old friend who introduced her to two guys and they hung out for a day. I didn't hear from her much that day until the morning after when he called me and said she cheated on me by kissing one of the boys. I was devastated. But after a lot of talking, we decided not to end our relationship. A few months later, I was over at her house and I did what I shouldn't have. I snooped through her e-mail and found out she had been messaging a stranger she met on the internet. I also found that she sent him very racy pictures of herself. She found out immediately and we again had a long and emotional discussion. I was more sad than anything to be honest. We're almost at our 3 year mark and everything seems to be alright (we're no longer long distance). But there's just this constant underlying thought in my head that she'll one day cheat on me again. She's changed a lot as a person from the day we met, and changed for the better. But I still can't seem to shake the doubt-monkey off my back. Her last long term relationship ended because she made out with a friend of hers and her boyfriend at the time found out. However, like I said, she has improved a lot as a person. Do I have trust issues? I just don't know how to go about this anymore. This is something I've never brought up because I've told her many times since the incident that I trust her; and I do. But there's just this silent but nagging doubt I always have. She's a really sweet and nice person, but also sometimes seems too nieve. She always seems to be attracted to people who end up being a bad influence, and it bothers me a lot but I refuse to be a controlling boyfriend who tells her who she can't or can't be with. She always has more guy friends than girls, she just seems to be that kind of girl. It concerns me at times because right now she's living in a dorm and often hangs out with one guy who's a bit if a stoner. I don't trust him at all. He's a nice guy, but a massive horn ball. He already got another girl who is a relationship to do "things" with him.   Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? Please help, and thank you.
Being an international relations major, this is horrible. Like I really think that people are acting 100% irrationally and quite frankly irresponsibly. The costs of them releasing these will be astronomically worse than the Iraq stuff they released earlier. I would almost go as far as to say that this isn't "investigative journalism" or being a "government watch dog." Honestly, this is almost borderline terrorism -- and I'm fairly liberal.   I want to put this into context: The United States, and EVERY OTHER nation spies and/or communicates with other nations. The United States has battle plans at the ready in every instance, and so does every other nation. The NSA and the military both have classified battle plans in case they have to invade Canada or Mexico. Would we use these? Probably not. But in these so called "hypothetical cases," we communicate with other nations on what their potential plans could be.   In addition to which, there's very sensitive information that's being discussed between countries. From what's spreading, these documents deal with discussions about Chinese Human Rights and North Korean Refugees. You have to understand that the United States engages in background politics to ensure that more people don't get harmed. The things that happen in the background in most instances are there to ensure that there's protection, sometimes, yes, the discussions are borderline - if not fully - unethical. But unfortunately, that's the world we live in. Exposing these documents does nothing but jeopardize further discussions that could potentially help others.   Do you really think the United States would tell China to completely stop Human Rights violations? Absolutely not. It would be impossible. It would be a diplomatic nightmare. The United States probably tells China that if it wants to operate like this, they should keep it at a minimum until the can make progress in affording or even having the ability to grant human rights. Its a horrible cost vs. benefits scenario. Allow people to suffer in the long run, or allow people to suffer in the short term and then progressively enhance these things.   In addition to which, the United States makes background deals in order to ensure working negotiations between nations in order to protect mutual interests. Several people have stated that a lot of these documents deal with North Korean refugees. Look, if the United States came out and publicly admitted that they support China's policies of getting North Koreans out of there and being placed under China's control the North Koreans would be PISSED and go on a rampage. There's working negotiations between the Chinese and the North Koreans to open borders slightly and open up for aid. If the United States made concessions that might be looked on as shameful (such as looking the other way in regards to Human Rights violations), it might be the best fucking option. To the public though they'd lose trust in the government and several other nations being exposed in this would bring international relations to a clusterfuck of a standstill or worse -- a massive war.   Not to mention, we don't even know what the fuck these documents contain. These documents have been scanned and looked at by people who have a political motive: to destroy governmental legitimacy. Some people will say that releasing these documents will IMPROVE governmental legitimacy. Are you fucking crazy? No, they do this to release documents and shame nations (mainly the United States) to change their policies. The problem is that CLASSIFIED STATE DEPARTMENT CABLES ARE CLASSIFIED FOR A REASON. They're classified to promote TRUST between nations. They don't release them for a reason. If you released all your classified discussions between nations YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED INTERNATIONALLY. Why the fuck should a hand full of individuals, who want to literally destroy government operations, be allowed to determine what documents should be released or not?   I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but understand that I was all in favor of the Iraqi documents being leaked because it showed the US government was covering up a lot of the things in Iraq -- most of which were wrong. This however is a classified discussion between GOVERNMENTS. Notice: It's plural, not singular.
I lurk on TRP partly for amusement and partly because it's almost sad to watch people be  so close  to having a correct philosophy while being so incredibly wrong. To me they're kind of like antivaxxers  (shitty analogy but gets the point across) - kind of making a sort of true argument, that if enough other people are immune then they're safe (herd immunity): but they're doing it for the absolute stupidest reasons, and so overall they're just plain wrong.   First off, there's nothing wrong with saying "I'm interested only in sex and not relationships." As long as your partners are informed of the situations, there is absolutely NOTHING morally wrong with solely desiring sex. Yes, you probably should have told her something along the lines of 'I have 0 interest in any typical relationship though I'm willing to be fuckbuddies' though that time is gone now. But just wanting sex isn't TRP, and just wanting sex doesn't mean you "hate women."   TRP is convinced that  all  women ride the "cock carousel" in their youth and are always swoon over "Chad Thundercock." They believe that women are incapable of doing work of equal quality of men, that all women seek validation from men (TBH I don't know where lesbians fit into their philosophy), that women are incapable of love, and that feminism is an anti-fertility movement. They also have some weird obsession with virginity because they enjoy devaluing girls based off the number of sexual partners they've had (while all the same time bragging about "spinning their plates"). If you disagree with any of this, you're not TRP.   The problem is that while TRP has some valid points - ex the Title 9 bullshit at colleges regarding sexual assault policies - they ruin them with shitty logic and overall terrible philosophy. If you've ever seen the threads which have titles along the lines of "Look at this TRP post found elsewhere on reddit, it has so many upvotes, they don't even know (etc)" you may have noticed one thing: while perhaps people agree with some of the tenets (ex lifting is good for you) they don't agree with the overarching philosophy. Being against the death penalty doesn't make you a Catholic. And for all they pretend that they're "alpha" they're always seeking validation from eachother about how "alpha" they are and how there are truly more "alphas" out there - so the entire philosophy is essentially bullshit
Chicago Cross Cup #3 - Dan Ryan Woods. Long course, big climbs, high-speed descents, singletrack climbs and root filled descents, two standard barriers, and three small ones that a lot of folks bunnyhopped. My second race ever. Pre-rode, everything seemed kosher.  Started at around 70/100. Huge pile-up coming out of the chute. Got around ten people or so. First climb was a bottleneck, so I dismounted and ran around about twenty people. Passed more on a fast descent. Was in the front third of the pack coming out of the first section of singletrack. Very fast slightly off-camber turn, rear wheel got out from under me. Tire pressure was too high. I came down flat on my face and chest and watched as everyone I'd just passed went by me. Got back up with a bloody nose, let a little air out, and kept going. Got by a few people on a straight, cleared the two stepover barriers without issue, cleared the solo bunnyhop barrier with a clean jump. Caught up to a friend at the set of two small barriers, right in front of the tents and most of the crowd. Cleared the first one without issue. My friend in front of me botched her remount (she ran the small barriers), so as I cleared the second one I went straight into her rear end, and the loss of momentum slammed my rear wheel into something. We both went down, I rolled through the tape into someone's dog. Got up, kept going. At this point, nose and knee are both bloodied. Finished lap 1, get about 15% into lap two and realize that I'm quickly losing pressure in the rear. Decided to risk it. Hairpin rolled my tire off of the rim and ended my race. Got back to where my wife posted up to see that my friend's brakes got jacked in the accident, so she also got DNF. Other than a tube, nothing is broken on myself, my bike, or her body. My knee looks/feels like hell, and my nose area is swollen. I guess I'll try again next week.
I'm not trying to exclude or talk down kids my age (14), I just feel as if I'm a lucky one. My dad has been listening to Radiohead since Creep first got huge on the charts here in the US. He says that the day I went home from the hospital , he had OK computer playing in the car on the way home. Radiohead has been apart of my life since day one and I appreciate it so much because I'm part of a rare few in my generation that knows almost every album lyric for lyric beginning to end. Sorry if this seems like some kind of "oh I wish I was born in this generation" kind of post but I just wanted to share my thoughts on how I'm in a small minority of kids who adore Radiohead. If you took the time to read this, thanks. :)
Hello. Just created this account for the sole purpose of subbing here. I was diagnosed with adult add about two months ago. I'm 37 and always kinda thought there wasn't right with, but could never really put my finger on it. I'm definitely not what you would call hyper, but I'd get distracted at work easily (like hearing colleagues typing on their kepboards would drive me insane, or I'd end up having 20 emails open at once, etc). To get to the point here, I went and saw a psychologist. He said I had adult ADD and referred me to a psychiatrist. I was given Strattera, but the side effects were kinda crazy (constipation, lethargy, appetite loss, trouble sleeping). The appetite loss baffled the psychiatrist because he said Strattera wasn't a stimulant. But I lost almost 15 lbs in the two weeks that I took it (it was one of those 30 day starter packs that ramp up the dosages). He put me on Adderall IR 15mg 2xDay. I can feel the benificial effects, work is improving, my home life is a little less chaotic (cleaned and organized my house ... yay!), and I'm able to eat but I'm still losing weight. I've lost a total 25 lbs in two months between the Strattera and Adderall. I eat healthy (eggs and some type of meat for breakfast, sandwich at lunch, typical dinner with sides and all) but I'm still losing like 2-4 lbs a week it feels like. I was a bit overweight to begin with, weighed 255 lbs. Now I'm down to 230 and my coworkers are noticing. I'm feeling a little self concious. Does anybody have any suggestions for KEEPING weight other than eating McDonald's 3 or 4 times a day?
My girlfriend and I have been dating on and off for a year. She suffers from anxiety and depression. I do not so admittedly I can't truly put myself in her shoes when it comes to situations like this.   I would consider myself a social person. I am not seriously extroverted or a "life of the party" type, but I have a large circle of friends I like to keep in regular contact with. This is my second year in University, my girlfriend just transferred here this year. Obviously I know a lot more people than she does here.   I have consistently invited her to hang out with my friends (girls and guys) when we are all doing stuff together. Out of the ~30 times I've invited her she has decided to come maybe 3 or 4 times. She has said she likes the majority of them (barring a few that she got bad first impressions from) and even texts some of them regularly.   When she isn't at school, a club, or hanging out with her roommates, she is laying in bed watching Netflix. I would estimate she spends 75% of her free time doing this. I don't have a problem with it, especially if it keeps her happy, but she often wants me to come lay in bed and watch with her. I'm fine with doing this on weekday afternoon/nights when nothing is going on, but she asks me to just as much on Friday/Saturday nights when I am often at parties (that I have invited her to) or hanging out with friends. If I decline her invitation to do this, she becomes extremely irritated with me and will be stand offish for the next few days.   I would love it if she would want to hang out with people on occasion, but I guess I shouldn't really expect that to change at this point. I just wish that she could come to understand that sometimes I prefer hanging out with my friends to lying in bed doing nothing especially if we have done that every day that week already. Any ideas how I can delicately bring this point across? She is very insecure and any dissatisfaction with our relationship I have brought up before has been met with her either breaking up with me for a day or so or completely shutting down.
Update:  I gave the pen back, told him how it made me smile all day due to childhood memories, he said it was his granddaughters pen from school that he grabbed off the counter on the way to work lol. Said he would let her know the adventures that her pen went on!
I want to comment on the "because they can" argument. This idea is correct, in the sense that they have so many applications that charging more to process an application is financially viable business practice. But I question is, why do they have such large demand in the first place?   No student that I know of personally can afford to go to university! Every student (well maybe closer to 4 in 5) that I attended school with had to take out loans to attend school. These loans are backed by the government, because let's face it, no one in their right mind would lend money to students who have no collateral and who are often young and have not established much creditworthiness.   Since there is such an influx of money available to people who don't meet logical lending practice standards, it artificially inflates the demand of the service of education. Because most people are actually quite poor, they would not he able to go to university. As a result, the schools and research institutions would have to restructure. Cut costs. Lay off teachers if they have too many. Reduce salaries. They would also have to cut tuition costs, to entice students to chose their university. The free market would actually create competition, where universities would attempt to offer the highest quality education at the lowest cost per student. That is the definition of success. They would have the most students, the most ideas and the most support in research simply by appealing to the actual demand of the market.   Instead of this, we have the artificial influx of borrowed money, and it puts the university's in to the drivers seat. Maybe they wish to charge a $3000 admin fee. Who's the stop them? It's ok, they can charge whatever they want, because the government is providing free debt to anyone who wishes, in the guise of "making sure higher education is available to all" and will match this rise in cost with the ability to take out larger loans (to students, who practically by definition cannot afford them, as they are in school and are not making any money or limited amounts from a part time job etc).   When government sets out to meddle in the market, it perverts the market from realizing the true supply and demand. This phony market that is created allows for abuses on the end of the universities. They love it! But truly it os not fair for the student or the tax payer who is ultimately on the line for the trillion+ in US debt created through the student loan process.   This is also the reason why a bachelors degree means nothing anymore. You graduate with 60-100k in debt and have a piece of paper to show for it, that everyone else has too.
One of which.. probably not the best but anywho: One day at my old work at a grocery store I went out to collect trolleys. I had about 6-9 without a rope attached to the one furthest away from me, and the car park I was in was on an incline (20-30 degrees). For some reason, the top trolley came off.. It was a busy day, and there were parked cars and cars everywhere. I watched in horror as this trolley started picking up speed as it raced down past me. I built up some strength and pushed the trolley line up hill and sprinted after the runaway trolley. I caught it just in time before it hit a expensive looking Mercedes.. Relieved , I turned around with the runaway trolley in my hands, and then saw my 'oh fuck' moment. The remaining trolley line had started to slow down.. That doesn't seem like much, but good ol' physics dictated that they all slow down at different rates due to the friction against other docked trolleys. So what this means is..the line of trolleys was starting to uncouple from one another. I pushed the trolley I had off into a nearby grassy area, and sprinted up to contain the line. By this point, there was three or four of the trolleys loose, coming down towards me.. I knew there was cars and potential damage all around me, so my adrenaline kicked in.. I caught the first one, spun it around (after about two years of doing trolleys, you start to get proficient with handling), and spun it around, smashing into another and slowing it down. I caught this other one, pushed my one up hill, grabbed the smash one, and then coupled(don't know a better word for it) them. There was two other trolleys that were coming down towards me, I then proceeded to... juggle my two trolleys, and two other not connected trolleys , gradually adding them to the line. The main line had stopped by this point, and I pushed my four trolleys up into them.  Sadly, of course in my only moment of work glory at that place , no one saw my oh fuck moment...but I was proud of myself.
I'm soon going to be a sophomore in college and I have been thinking about getting a 13 inch Macbook Air, but I've also started looking into getting 13' Pro. Right now I am a Film making major and I'm not planning on changing anytime soon, so I'm thinking i'm going to need a machine that can handle all that entails. I know I don't NEED a mac but I'd like to try one out seeing as if I get one it would be my first and I'm willing to spend my money to experience a different computer. So which computer with what specs should I look into?
I personally think if a team went from being coached by Mike Brown to Gregg Poppovich, that would be the equivalent of adding a fringe All-Star level player. What do y'all think?   Edit:
Dear Redditors,   Have any of you considered becoming a police officer, politician or activist to combat the corruption you see in the world?   Granted, we generally see the scummy end of police encounters on the internet, most certainly on TV, even though most officers are good folk. We all know politicians lie to get elected, etc. Media outlets blatantly fabricate stories or mislead viewers or, the worst, offer their own opinions instead of simply reporting the truth. Do you ever feel as though you need to jump into that fray, simply because you're sick and tired of things like police officers arresting people for video taping them in public? What about politics? I realize that many people get into it with the best intentions but then start to slip up and shying away from their beliefs in order to get votes, but damn it all, by doing that you're letting everyone down.   Is integrity forgotten? Strength and resolve too? I was raised to speak truthfully, praise honesty and strength, use logic and reason, to not hurt people unless it's self defense and to care for the people around me.
decent'. And thats the problem. If youre playing decent in the toplane then its fine. If youre playing decent in the midlane then  your team will have a bad time(or atleast not a good one). Especially if youre kassa is a "decent" by far not good enough but a top jayce is totally fine when hes decent.
EDIT   I posted an update [here]( Thank you so much for your advice here.   So sorry for the long post.   My mom recently got divorced with my dad about 9 months ago. They accumulated a ridiculous shitton of debt through gambling and loans. While I was in high school they had a gambling problem and still bought 2 new expensive cars. They are completely terrible with their finances and my brother and I always had to deal with the ramifications of their bad decisions.   EDIT  Also, I have NO sympathy for my father. I do have some for my mom because my dad tanked a bunch of his businesses and didn't pay fines/taxes and it came out of my mom's personal accounts because he took out all his money to evade the IRS taking money. So I kind of feel like my dad was her downfall (she used to be much better with money) but she made tons of mistakes as well.   They borrowed more than 150k total in the last 3-5 years that I'm sure of, but who knows how much more (only recently found out about this amount too). During this time, our bills were still never paid and we constantly had our power shut off, no hot water, landlord coming by to collect rent, etc.   When my dad left (he had an affair), my mom was in a hard situation because my dad evaded the people he owed money to, and then the loaners came to my mom and harassed her. She feels obligated to pay a ridiculous amount of debt that they both accumulated when she probably makes 30k a year and still has no control over her finances. So, my brother and I got an apartment and we agreed to pay her rent for one year between us. At the time I wasn't working (my dad insisted I go to school and he could support me even if I didn't work, of course his word means shit) and then got any job I could get, which was only part time and I probably make like 15k from that yearly. Obviously that's not much left for rent and my brother is in sales and makes a gross of like 40k+ a year but his paycheck amount fluctuates on how good his sales were. He has covered the rent himself for about 5 months and he sold his car (that my parents bought, for 20k). I don't know how much my mom 'borrowed' from that 20k (over half?) but he holds this over us constantly. I absolutely appreciate it and have chipped in where I can, paying the electric bill, cooking for him few times a month, buying necessities, doing the laundry, etc. But that means very little to him.   My boyfriend and I want to move out together when the lease is up. I want to live my own life. I'm so tired of being responsible in my life while still dealing with the consequences of the bad decisions of my parents. My mom constantly needs help with everything such as paying her bills (as in she gives me money and I take care of actually calling them in), helping her through the divorce legal stuff (I know nothing so...?), making her business cards, helping with business tax stuff (I definitely know nothing about this but she doesn't want to spend money on someone who does?) and stuff like that. My brother does not deal with these things, he gets very very angry and says he works too hard to deal with having the stress of my mom's requests.   Since my brother was having an issue with paying so much rent, I have been looking for a better paying job, even though my work now has been promising me full time and a raise (but who knows when that will be). I have been talking to him every few months, gently introducing the idea that we all go our separate ways after the lease is up. He agreed and said that is what he wanted to do.   Yesterday, I got the luckiest break ever and after 4 grueling interviews got a job offer with a 41k salary. After hearing about this, my brother says he wants to renew the lease because it would be better to live together than to live with roommates and still paying the same. He doesn't do laundry, cook, clean, deal with the mail, or anything - he just works and pays rent and can get away with living however he wants and being messy. I HATE this and want to live in a place where people clean after themselves. Now, after my mom and brother hear about my salary, they want to live together for another year. I offer to send them extra money every month if they need help but I want to live with my boyfriend. They shoot down everything, say I'm ungrateful, say it's just for another year and my mom would be in a better place (how? she said this last year... every year I've been alive... still owes 80k). My boyfriend says I keep the place together and manage all the details and help them with whatever they need so they still want to live with me but are using guilt to make me stay and postpone living independently.   I hate living with them so badly but I'm conflicted because they say I'm abandoning them. Could you give some advice?   Edit:  Ok I am going to leave. Should I pay my brother back? He won't even be happy about it I feel like he would rather have the 'power' and mighty feeling of being our savior than have the 3k back... My bf says he wants to lend me the money and have me pay him back but I feel uncomfortable with that too. Should I give my mom some extra money like couple hundred a month to help?
I used to work as a night shift janitor in one of the zoology buildings on campus.  The building was basically divided by floors, with entomology on one floor, marine biology on another, etc.   It was about midnight, and I THOUGHT I was completely alone, when I bumped into this nice (but very socially awkward) professor.  I asked her why she was there so late, and she explained to me that she was cataloguing samples.  When I asked "Samples of what?" she led me to this room that turned out to be full of shelves of jars- kind of like the prophecy room in Harry Potter.   She showed me the jars that she was cataloguing- they each had these weird fleshy animal parts in them.  When I asked her what they were, she said they were female reproductive organs of various mammals indigenous to the midwest.
My wife is a second grade teacher and the other day a second her a text message joking about anal sex.  She told me later that evening that she had been using a document camera to project her iphone screen onto the wall as a timer for the kids when my text popped up.
It has very little to do with your physical form and everything to do with what it changes about your mental state. Sure, looking better and receiving compliments/looks from the opposite sex helps boost your confidence and everything, but what did it for me more than anything was a routine and notable progress.   Depression took the wind out of my sails, every day was a challenge, just to get up, to move or get motivated to do anything. Not going into detail about it, I was a sack of shit for awhile. Working out gave me a structure, it gave me something to look forward to and to know that today's version of me is better than yesterday's. Not to mention, the mental clarity and discipline that working out gives you.   The past is the past and the only thing you can do, in fact, the best thing you can do is to better your current self to show that you've moved on. I know it's easier said than done, but I can guarantee it will change your life if you truly commit to it.   Just browsing through fitness boards like 4chan's /fit/ or /r/fitness here on Reddit showed me that a lot of people starting working out because they were depressed and it helped them. That was one of the biggest reasons I decided to do it and holy shit am I glad that I did.   Feel free to ask any questions, I don't care how personal/detailed. I'm an open book. Hope something here helped and I'm not trying to offend.
So the other day I was using my computer when my monitor decided it did not want to auto detect my computer anymore, switching back and forth between digital and analog before finally sticking with analog and telling me to check signal cables. The sound was still going but it was like what would happen if my computer had froze (constant, same sound loop). So I rebooted the computer, and it made a beep and booted up like it normally does but still no display on the monitor. I made a few calls, and my MOBO was beeping as it should, with all signs pointing to a defective GPU. So I ordered myself a nice GTX460 because I needed an excuse to upgrade anyway.   After installing this new card, my MOBO refuses to even beep now, just booting up with everything seeming to run (HD, and all fans including CPU/GPU and all USB ports are powered). I have already re-seated everything in my system and still have the same issue. The only slightly odd thing is when my monitor is switched to digital the monitor will act as if it is properly plugged in, but the computer is off/sleep mode (Black screen power light flashes).   I have pretty much come to the conclusion that it IS my MOBO that is defective, I was just hoping for some more opinions on this matter. I am taking it to get a diagnostics test here in a day or two, but if anyone can offer some expertise in this subject I may not need it.   As far as system spec's are concerned: PSU: is a 585W Orion HP585D (I know, but it was a good price with a good warranty)   MOTHERBOARD: MSI K9N SLI-F V.2 NVIDIA nForce 570 LT SLI Chipset DDR2/800 SATA RAID PCI-Express MBoard w/GbLAN,USB2.0,&7.1Audio   CPU: AMD Phenom(TM) X3 8650 Triple-Core CPU w/ HyperTransport Technology   GPU: ASUS GTX460 1 GB GDDR5 PCI-Express Graphics Card ENGTX460 DirectCU/2DI/1GD5  and/or a evga Geforce 9800 GTX   MEMORY: 4GB (2x2GB) PC6400 DDR2/800 Dual Channel Memory   Thanks for the help!!
Wow... just... wow...   This game... is AWESOME!! Seriously, I would've never pictured myself enjoying this game a year ago, and now, just... wow! But so far, clocked in about 11 hours according to my Steam account, and I'm enjoying every minute of it.   So my story with this game: well, in the beginning, I never had much thought into it. When I first heard of it, I was like, "An Elder Scrolls themed MMORPG, sounds cool man." but I was immediately turned off when I discovered that it had that $15 monthly subscription fee. Then i watched Angry Joe's review of the game and that was that. I never had much care for that game from there on out.   Until I discovered in February that Zenimax Online Studios decide to drop the subscription fee. I decided to do some research of my own and discovered that Zenimax was planning ahead for a 2.0 overhaul of the game called "Tamriel Unlimited". And then reading the  future plans by Zenimax . I came in with no expectations beyond the fact that this was an Elder Scrolls themed MMORPG.   The gameplay is solid for me, successfully maintaining the traditional action-packed combat of The Elder Scrolls with MMORPG abilities and UI. the community (though I haven't joined any groups yet) is passive and much better than  cough cough  GTA Online  cough cough . The voice-acting is superb. The quests are all I find well-written and designed better than dare I say it, Skyrim. And this is coming from someone who still reveres Skyrim as one of my favorite games of all time. Crafting is a bit... different, coming from Skyrim, but I'm starting to learn the ropes. And oh man, I cannot wait to see what this game has in store for me soon: grouping, PvE, PvP, endgame, exploring the other factions, guilds. Writing this down, I'm feeling like a little kid entering the candy store, can't wait for what this game has to offer.   But seriously, this game is awesome, you guys are awesome, and the queen is awesome. GET HYPED!!! :)   EDIT: grammar and spelling. Also, I forgot to include that this is also my first MMORPG. Though I have played GTA Online and the Destiny beta, this is so far my favorite multiplayer game.   EDIT 2: I really have only one complaint about this game so far, a minor one: I'm a bit disappointed that Zenimax did not use Christopher Corey Smith to voice Molag Bal (he voiced the Daedric prince in Skyrim, I personally found him more intimidating). As well as the fact that they never approached Wes Johnson to voice Sheogorath, Hermaous Mora, or anybody in particular. Missed opportunity. And this is probably a dumb thing for me to say, but I would like to see a way that players can obtain Crowns for the Crown Store in game, to help stimulate the Crown Store economy. I really don't know, to be honest.
I'm planing a new table build (3 actually) and would appreciate some advise on joining the top together.   The top will be made of ~5x  8" wide 8/4 boards at roughly 80" in length. The wood will be reclaimed heart pine.  Here is a quick sketchup:   I'm concerned about longevity of the piece and wood movement, so I'd like to build it right the first time.  Based on what I've seen around the interwebs it appears that three leading options are available to ensure a stress-free and even glue up:     Glue with Cawls   Loose Tenons   Biscuits     From my limited experience, here's my assessment of each option:     Modern glues are very strong, and glueing along the grain (side grain/edge grain/long grain) will work fine as long as I use cawls to ensure a flat glue up. (time required: minimal)     Loose tenons may take a bit to setup on a router (edge guide or using a template), but the joint will be stronger than glue alone, especially for a table top of this size. It is worth the extra effort. (time required: probably a decent amount since it's my first attempt at loose joinery)     Biscuits won't add much strength to a table top of this size, but will make life easy to ensure that the table top is close to flat. It's probably still worth using cawls, but the biscuits will make things simple. (time required: minimal)       Given the size of the table top, what do you recommend?  I'm not sold on a dowelling jig, so I left that option out.
Long time vaper, started on my little quest [here](   Long story short, Lavatube V2, want to get into RBAs. Know NOTHING about them really. I am a dripper, don't want a tank/carto/anything... Are RBA's "bridgeless" too?   What are the benefits and differences between the IGO-L vs the A7 vs the Pheonix? What are the draws like, where the airhole is and what difference it makes, do I have to tilt them, will they leak, etc.   What should I look for in a coil, or wick?   Also, I notice this: > Rebuildable atomizer coils and wicks have known risks.  Rebuildables are for experts, not average or beginner vapers with no multimeter or knowledge of how to use a meter, or when a meter must be used, or how electronic devices work.   Anyone care to enlighten me on this? I don't own a multimeter, I haven't used once since High School... I'm  assuming  that's just so you can check the resistance of the wick you put in? How dangerous is an RBA?   Tell me EVERYTHING. There is no such thing as
Firstly, I know I am probably not a very likeable person and I feel horrible that I even need to learn NOT to despise people who make different choices than I. Secondly, this is probably going to be a long vent. I decided to write it here since I thought maybe other CF people might understand me better.   I have always been proud to label myself as a benevolent "live and let live" kind of person. Generally I've been interested in other people's life choices but that's about it, people are free to do what they like with their lives as long as they're not harming others.   However, about a year ago this started to change, perhaps at the same time when I began to read /r/childfree. No way am I blaming another subreddit for my own hostility because it has been a great sourse of support for me multiple times. But I guess that might've had some impact, nonetheless.   At the same time my family would start to bingo me and harass me about having children and they'd never listen to my opinion. So maybe it's some kind of defense mechanism: people try to force you to eat broccoli, you hate broccoli even more. I'd get angry and every time I saw families and children, I'd remember my parents who would try to push it down my throat that  I would  have kids one day. I still get a lot of anxiety for my parents declining to listen to my reasoning and I feel like I can't really be myself around them. Otherwise they are loving and reasonable parents.   Anyway, all this has really made me feel very hateful whenever I see kids. I can't really see them as human-beings, only as something that I definitely don't want anything to do with as it would lead to more bingos. I comprehend that hating on people who have decided to reproduce is wrong. I've known it all the time and I've never really shown my hatred. But it has started to take over my life and I feel tired.   Lately I've been trying really hard to become who I was before and quit being so hostile because I'm quite scared of how I'm now. I don't like myself very much but I'm afraid of people (family mostly) harassing me more if I show any compassion towards children. I've tried not to think about it too much and so I've began to investigate families' blogs and vlogs on YouTube (I like Ellie & Jared). It has helped me a lot and at times I feel like I was before but then I remember that people are expecting me to do the same and they won't listen to me and I just turn back into some scared aggressive animal. I'm embarrassed of the way I am.   ^
It's not really funny because in my city, there aren't any more handwritten prescriptions.  It's all done electronically, which creates all sorts of problems.  I never gave permission for any of my patient data to be entered into any Internet-connected databases, but they did it anyway, and don't even understand what the problem is after breakins at massive facilities like Anthem occur.
Legit question here, hopefully someone can give me some insight. Bear with me while I explain...   I used to live in San Diego (~4 years) - surfed as much as I could and got pretty darn good. Had no problems surfing some of the best breaks in big conditions.   Fast forward 3 years, now I'm living in NY and I've probably surfed 3 times in the last 3 years. Last weekend the surf out in Montauk was pretty epic (according to my standards at least) [pics of the surf from that day] (   I had access to my board and yet instead of going in, I stayed and took photos of other people having an amazing time. If it were 3 years ago, I would have been the first guy in the lineup.   So, where am I going with all of this - basically I was too much of a pussy to get out there b/c I haven't ridden barrels before and wasn't sure I had the skill to do it. When I look at all these surfing videos and photos of people in barrels, it  looks  so easy, but I know it's not. If there's another day like that day, I want to have the confidence to get out there and enjoy myself. Is there anything you guys can tell me that would increase my success in riding barrels?
author:  malagrond   |  author karma:  15 / 990   |  [original story's comments](  |  [flag]( describe why you're flagging this submission -       I posted here a while back, something like "I'm a Christian who respects logic and reason.

I'm 14 years old, I have had the same hairstyle since I can remember and I am in desperate need of a change. I have had long/medium length hair because I have always wondered what people thought of my ears. [They stick out a lot and have no definition]( and they have always put my confidence down.   But my mindset right now is to just deal with it and go with it but I am stumped with what I should get.[ I have put together a very small album of some inspo of the style I like the look of. (1950's/60's rockabilly)]( But I'm not to sure if my hair is thick enough to do what I would like it to do, m[y hair is very thin and fine but there is lots of it.](   [Also for some strange reason I have never had any sideboards.](
I've been going to AA for 8 months now and things have been pretty smooth. I've been kind of dragging my feet on getting a sponsor and working the steps though.  I was talking to my uncle who is two years sober and goes to NA.  He suggested I give that a shot, at the very least I'd expand my circle of sober contacts and at the very best I'd find someone with whom I identify and will become my sponsor.   Anyone been to both?  What do you prefer? I don't really know anything about NA other than it's based on the same 12 steps.  The meeting is Friday and I'm excited but curious to know more in the meantime.   I guess most of my history is in using drugs, stopped when the wife got pregnant and then just picked up with alcohol, so in the sense that I'll use anything in front of me for a buzz, NA is a good fit in principle.  I'm in AA today only because alcohol is the only drug I ever run into these days.
I made a sweater for my husband this summer. I found this wonderful and cheap Icelandic lopi and bought enough for 3 sweaters.  I knit myself one, it only took me 2 days! Then I got started on his.   It had an all over Fair Isle pattern to make it extra warm.  When I finished the body and one sleeve I noticed that what I thought was all dark grey skeins of yarn, were actually a mixture of dark grey and dark brown skeins. The front and back were knit in all grey, while the sleeve was brown. Of course all the yarn left was brown - I had to unravel the entire body of the sweater.   First I threw the knitting across the room. Then I gathered myself, took a deep breath and sat down to start again.  But not without making a huge mistake first I mostly make my own patterns, and thought I should do a quick measurement of the sweater before unraveling to check the fitting. My husband wasn't home, the papers were lost, a was angry, so I consulted a chart and found that the sweater was to narrow.  So I cast on some extra stitches and finished the sweater.   At this point just thinking about this thing could almost make me vomit, I was crazy sick of it. But when I start knitting something, especially when I have spent real money on the yarn I rarely quit. The angrier I get with something, the more stubborn I become- no sweater will ever break me! Even if I have to rage-knit for weeks to finish it.   Of course when my husband tried on the thing, it was just a terribly misshapen monster of a sweater. When I saw it,it was like something inside of me disappeared. I was so ashamed, and angry and wanted to cry.   When I unraveled it the first time, I should have done something else with it. I tried shrinking it, but it made it worse.  This experience has taught me never to start over huge projects when you are angry, at least not until you have taken a break from it to calm yourself. Knitting while angry just produces monsters.   Now I am turning this monster into a pillow or two.  Beside my husband no one has seen the thing, and no one ever will.
OR, "Why Saints Fans Shouldn't Be Allowed to Customize AR-15s"   Alrighty. The road to my first AR-15 has started. Let's just say that I was looking for a color scheme and living in NOLA has started to get to me. ^^^^fuck ^^^^the ^^^^falcons   I know some of y'all are traditionalists and don't like color-fills, but I figured some of y'all would like this. Apologies in advance for potato photos. I did this at night in a poorly-light room and sobriety was optional.   Getchu [some supplies](     Isopropyl alcohol   Nail polish   Non-acetone  nail polish remover. The non-acetone part is important to prevent discoloration.      Getchu [your lower]( I chose an Anderson Manufacturing lower from KYGunCo because the shipping was free and the lower was $70. [There was a reason that the shipping was free.]( Fuck KYGunCo. Even my FFL was surprised when it came in a bag. There were definitely minor blemishes in multiple locations because of this. At any rate, IDGAF enough to have it returned. Moving forwards...   Put [a show]( on in the background. You're going to have to wait for the nail polish to dry. Multiple, thin coats > few, thick coats.   [Clean up the lower]( with a cleaning cloth and the isopropyl alcohol. Make sure that the lower is [clean and dry]( before you apply nail polish.   Shake the bottle of nail polish real hard, wick off the excess, and get to work. Go crazy with it, do as little, [or as much]( as you want. Just make sure to keep the coats moderately thin. Thinner == faster drying.   Getchu dat [nail polish remover]( Wipe off the lower, being very careful not to press too hard. Pressing too hard will remove the polish from the engraving. Moderate pressure and short, repetitive swipes should clean the excess polish off.   Repeat as necessary. I only had to go over mine twice before[ I was satisfied.]( Note that I'm a fucking fool and picked a polish with glitter in it. This is not a bad thing, necessarily. The glitter is fairly small and seems like it's stuck there at least semi-permanently, giving the metal a neat speckled effect.   I liked the speckled effect a lot. [God, what have I done?](   As you can see, it looks like the speckled effect [turned out okay]( on the other side, too.   I am pleased.  Time to continue on with the rest of the build. This might end up being a pistol build because I'm stupid like that, I like the Sig brace, and I was told that that Jefferson & Orleans Parish police are mostly unwilling to sign off on NFA items.
This story is kind of embarrassing, but it brings a bit of context.   Over the past summer I made an effort to exercise and get in better shape. I've always been pretty skinny and finally I'm looking a bit better.   Anyways I started off the schoolyear and it turned out there was a really cute Japanese exchange student in my PE class. I really wanted to get to know her but I was too shy. Sometimes I thought she might have been glancing at me, but I thought it was my imagination. I was pretty shy and it seemed I would never be able to talk to her. I started to notice her glancing at me more often along with standing near me and I thought it was undeniable that she was at least a little interested in me. A few weeks ago she actually sat by me but she avoided eye contact and I was still too shy. Finally a couple days later (third last week of January) I decided to stop being a wimp and sat down beside her and talked to her during the off-time in PE. We were both pretty nervous and I thought I kind of sounded like an idiot, but it was alright. After a few minutes of talking we had to go back to playing. I thought she probably wasn't interested in me, but before I went to bed she messaged me on Facebook (I had already added her a few months back) saying "Hello austinweiss13, I'm glad to talk you in PE class :)". Then I was pretty happy and texted back I did as well. The next morning she texted me "Good Morning" and said she would see me in class. This is where things get a little weird, I'm assuming she got shy and kind of avoided me in class that day but I did make an effort to say hello to her. Afterwards she texted me asking if I enjoyed class and how I was doing. She continued to avoid me in person but still text me. About a week later I asked if she needed any help studying via text and she politely declined. I thought she probably wasn't into me but then she kept texting me after I decided to leave her alone. So I've kept up texting her until the end of the semester. We both texted each other about our upcoming classes and I managed to switch into a Photography class she was taking. I sit beside her every class, but one of her Asian exchange student friends (a girl, not Japanese) is always sitting on the other side of her and they always talk. The Japanese girl I like is usually too shy to say hello to me and just talks to her friend the whole class. Although she did say "hello" to me while walking into class with her friend a few days ago. It feels kind of weird to sit by her and not say anything, but I am very shy and I don't want to interrupt her and she is the only person I know in the class. Last week I got her a gift for Valentine's Day and gave her a card that said "thank you for being my friend" in Japanese. She was really happy and texted me thank you multiple times afterwards. It just kind of sucks because I want to get closer to her but its really hard when she is always talking to her friend. I think she might have told her friend that she likes me, because her friend always makes sure she sits beside me. Today something really strange happened. I was processing my film in the dark room during photography class and I walked out of it to take some more pictures. She was walking in with her friend and its kind of semi dark in the exit but I could clearly see her. I said "hi qt's_name" to her and as if she didn't hear it or see me at all she stumbled into me and kind of grabbed my arm for a second and then got all embarrassed and muttered sorry while her friend started giggling. Then afterwards her friend and her kept giggling when I was near them.   I'm just not sure what to think of all this and how to overcome being so shy around her. I'm pretty sure she likes me because she texts me quite often even if I don't respond. Is my best option to just trying to talk to her when she's talking with her friend?
I would recommend against ever making vague plans with a girl. Don't ever say "We should hang out sometime" "Let's get a drink sometime" etc. It should always be "Lets hang out this friday, I have so and so going on and it's gonna be fun" or "Hey come get a drink with me tonight."
One time I went to a game that was in the middle of nowhere - in a pub somewhere in the fields. The people were nice, the GMs were ok, the plot was - well, there was a plot. But the location was horrible. Basically it was a normal pub and while we were playing, the normal patrons of that pub were on the other side of the door, getting louder and more drunk by the hour.   At some point one of the patrons came into our room and shouted: "Look... Don't get me wrong... I think everybody should be happy and do what he or she loves. But... isn't this pretty much escapism what you are doing?"   To which I thought: "Ok, mate. You go to a pub. In the middle of nowhere. Out in a field. On a Saturday night. And poison your brain to the point where you don't feel anything anymore. And YOU call US escapists?"   Yes, it is a form of escapism. Absolutely. For up to a week, I am not the same person. I play a character who has his own motives, ideas, plans, friends and enemies. Is that problematic? No.   I also have a very stressful job. It is very likely that I get a call and I need to work overtime, possibly even on weekends. And despite that, I stay sane. I don't suffer from burnouts. Why? Because every now and then, I put my ordinary life in a corner, turn off the mobile, leave my computers at home, don a tunic, go to some place in the woods and play a different person for a while. That character may win, may lose, may even die. But whatever happens, every day I have more stories to tell, more extraordinary experiences to make and bold actions to report.   And after that time, I go home and I'm me again - feeling that delicious mixture of energised and absolutely tired. You are inspired, you had incredible fun to the point where your body didn't feel, didn't WANT to feel the exhaustion and now you just want a shower / a bath and 9-10 hours of sleep - and you don't care in which order.   In German we have a phrase for that: "Ferien vom Ich" - "Vacation from the I", meaning that it can be very refreshing to leave everything that defines your normal self behind for a while.   Can this be dangerous? Sure. For a relatively normal, relatively sane person, all this is just an exciting hobby. But there are cases where LARP pushed a schizophrenic over the edge, where borderline personalities took everything too seriously and where the difference between "game" and "reality" was violated by people who should know better. And there are people who speed in a car. Everything has its dangers and LARP is no exception.   Most LARPers I know lead absolutely normal lives otherwise, with normal jobs. They have bfs or gfs, wifes or husbands and they even have kids. Sometimes the whole family comes to a LARP, something I like very much. So, no, thanks, you don't need to tell me to get a job. I have one, thank you very much. You don't need to tell me to have sex. I'm sexually active, thank you very much. You don't need to tell me to have a life. I have a brilliant, exciting and fun life. And my hobby is one of the reasons for this.   And if you want to, come along. I cordially invite you to accompany me to the Drachenfest. For science.   And, for the record: that pig costume in the picture is incredibly ugly.
If you are searching for some legitimate advice, I would recommend reading Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People." The book breaks down some fundamental truths about what it means to be a friend, make people interested in you, and, in general, be a better person. If you are seriously interested in improving your social skills, this is the book for you. You can find a pdf version through a simple google search or you can buy it from your local book store. Either way, after you read the first chapter you'll understand exactly what I'm talking about!
I've got my first pet turtle a few days ago. yaay. I have some questions.   How much do I give her to eat? I found some info on the internet but got nothing really useful. Mostly things like "give little turtles food a few times a day, adult turtles every other day." My turtle is pretty young (cca 5cm across the shell) so I guess it still has to eat every day, but how much do I give it? A lot of people warn about overfeeding them, but how am I supposed to know when is enough?   Plus, when I feed it, I have to put the brick (turtle food..) directly in front of her mouth, otherwise she won't see it and will keep waiting.   I have also heard that it's a good idea to have a small pond of clean water for her to drink, seperate of her swimming water. Which leads me to another question, how will she know that there is some clean water on the other side of her aquarium if she can't even find her food 2 cm away from her?
First off, I'm not sure if this is even the correct subreddit for this question. Life changing decision time. I am separating from the military with no job-related skills in the civilian world. I don't enjoy what I do very much, and wouldn't like to continue it but that's the only job I seem qualified for.   I have a wife, two-year-old daughter, and a home that's paid off to go back to. And finally I have around 300K in savings. No debt. Now the decision part: Should I find a job that we will only barely scrape by and take care of family and finances first or can I justify digging into savings and go to school full time. Its always been my goal to get a Bachelors and move on to a graduate degree from a prestigious university. I feel as though I am intelligent enough to do so, I have friends that took different paths and are doing so, but having a family changes things.   We can do it. With savings plus a part-time job we could survive many years as a full time student.   Any advice or experience people have from similar situations would be greatly appreciated. Will we be better off in the long run ect...
Hello, to start off I would like to give you some statistics about my current health, I am a 16 year old male that is 5'6 and weighs 210 lbs.. My current body fat percentage is 29% and my lean body mass is 149.1 lbs.. To go about lowering body fat percentage I was recommended by my trainer to go on portion control, while others said to do lots of cardio, and go on a calorie deficit.   So to begin with my first question, 1.) I find it really boring to do cardio alone unless someone is there to push me or if there is someone doing cardio. Otherwise, I find it REALLY easy to quit a few minutes in. I am looking for a solution to not quit so easily. Also, what is the best type of cardio workout to cut body fat %, whether it be sprinting, long distance jogging, weight resistance workouts, etc.?   2.) I want to be very strict with my diet but my willpower is just way too weak. People who eat healthy are usually disgusted by fast food and junk food but I cannot help myself when it comes to it. I was told that if I cannot cut it out of my life then I would have to go on portion control. Is there a way to teach yourself to eat healthy and not binge on junk food? I would rather find a way to teach myself to cut it out of my life completely rather than having to cut down on portions.   3.) I was told a lot of methods to cut my body fat %, whether it be portion control, counting calories, counting macros, cardio, etc. but in the end I am still looking for a solution for cutting down my body fat % substantially in the best way possible, what do you reccommend?   Any help will be greatly appreciated, I want to live a healthier life and it would mean the world if you could help out even in the slightest.
Okay, now in the tenor of the Internet: fuck them and their loser god.  You don't have to take any of their judgemental shit.   But that's too easy.  Read on.   I think your friend revealed more about hir  own  insecurities than ze has about yours.  If ze reacted so strongly to the admonition that you and your wife are even  thinking  about dating a girl together, calling you an insecure pervert who's going to ruin hir marriage by breaking the sacred vow of monogamy (which is totes the only natural because all species with sexual dimorphism mate for life don'chaknow, especially primates! God is really amazing!), I think there are likely some less-than-benign motivations lurking behind it.   I know: it seems intellectually lazy to say that someone who stands strongly against something must ashamedly indulge in it in secret, but many Republican sex scandals (among other things) have taught me that people are often  just that puerile and unsophisticated  about covering up their thoughts and deeds.  It could be that ze has infidelities in hir past that ze is ashamed of; it could also be that hir parent's marriage or the marriage of someone close to them was harmed by deceit about infidelity (I maintain, as some others do, that lies and contempt, not sex, are what destroy marriages); it could be none of those things.   Those of us who have been doing this for a while have probably faced censure at least once for our non-monogamy if it be known, or kept quiet lest this happen.  But we also craft poly-positive social circles for ourselves, and stand up for ourselves and our choices when nominal "friends" decry us as pungent mold on a decaying civilization.  I would advise you to do the same, but with this caveat: if you suspect that your friend is amplifying hir disdain to cover up their own insecurities, you won't help them by disassociating from them.
Hello /r/relationships! I've been a long time user of this sub but haven't ever really posted for advice that's as important as this. Throwaway since my boyfriend uses Reddit and knows I frequent this sub, and please forgive me for any formatting or spelling errors as I'm using mobile. I'm asking for advice on how to survive and handle this so I'll give backstory to help give an idea of who we are. I think that'll help? Idk   My boyfriend Will and I met in high school and have been together ever since. We go to the same college and have an apartment together with three other students this year, and dormed last year. Our relationship hasn't been too great for a while I guess but I didn't really notice it, or tried to ignore it. In high school we were very happy and going into freshman year of college, we had a period of time where we would have a fight about something once a week, regularly. We discussed breaking up but never wanted to. After fighting we would make up and talk about how to fix things and improve, and I think we've done a lot of growing and changing for each other, in good ways. Recently, we haven't fought for a while but also Will has become increasingly distant and moody. This has been going on since before Christmas, but I can't really remember how long it's been. He's chalked it up to various things, like not enjoying classes, becoming stressed and anxious about his career since we're halfway through college already, and becoming disenchanted with the industry we plan to join. Things like that.   Our last fight we talked about taking a break and changing things but it didn't really happen. He isn't always moody. He's an amazing partner, driving me places, having fun going grocery shopping together, going on fun movie and dinner dates, cuddling and goofing around together, and just having fun times. But the past week I've felt like I've been walking on eggshells around him, afraid to make him annoyed at me, but annoying him anyway on accident to have him make passive rude statements, brush me off, roll his eyes when I say something or ask him something, etc. Thursday night I blew up at him about it when he was insensitive to me over text and I left my class and came home and we went to a private place and fought for a while. It ended up with him lecturing me and I stormed out of the car and walked away, and he left to go somewhere else.   Other stuff happened but I think that's not very important to the story and to spare you all the boring details, we ended up talking more calmly and Will told me he wants to take a break. He said he cares about me, can see himself being with me forever, and wants to stay best friends because I'm his best friend, but needs to "get stuff out of his system" to be with me and something along the lines of "hates the idea of sacrificing everything for our future." I'm not really sure what he means about the last part. I'm really heartbroken but I've been feeling some of the same stuff and wondering what it would be like to be single at this time in my life, although I didn't truly want to try it out. I think I can be happy with this but I'm just worried that we are going about it too naively and we'll ruin our relationship that I really cherish.   I left to stay at my parent's for the weekend and haven't seen him in two days. We're planning to have a serious talk tonight to figure everything out and lay out some rules and a time frame and stuff. There are some things I already know we need to talk about, like how long the break will be, if we will be seeing other people, how much we will interact, and what exactly he needs to get out of his system. What else do we need to talk about to make this work?
To start with, let me give a bit of a technical explanation. LED's are diodes, they will only allow current to flow in one direction. Luckily, this means if you plug them in backwards, nothing will go wrong, they just won't turn on. The issue with diodes is that when conducting in the forward direction, they have a relatively low resistance. A common blue led will have a maximum current rating of 60mA and a forward voltage of about 3.2 volts. If you have a 3.2 volt source, you can plug it straight into the led and everything will be fine. However, if you have (for example) a 5 volt source, you will need to add a current limiting resistor. In this case, you will want a 33ohm resistor. I can show the math if you like, however there is a very handy calculator for this [here](
That is really not the case. You may feel that way, but if  most  kids who were in school felt that way, then none of them would go.   It really has not been that long since I was in high school and I have a sibling still in high school. Its not nearly as bad as you are saying. Even if it were, high school may promote those things, but guess what, thats fucking life. So grow the fuck up and do something about it if you dont like it, because as an adult thats what youre going to have to do.   Dont start crying to me about stress and anxiety and depression, Ive been through all that shit to the point where I was lying catatonic in bed for a long time and Ive still come out a well rounded and successful individual with a positive opinion of the high school experience.
My friends dad almost killed me, my friend, and my friend's brother. Long story short is we caught him cheating on his wife while we were having a sleepover. We went to go play paintball outside (hick area) and we got thirsty realllly fast. So like a half hour later we go inside and see his neighbor naked in the living room.... on the couch... on his dick. The dad gets really really really upset and beats up the neighbor lady until she runs away. He then starts drinking. A LOT. We decide to play outside and try to make the best of the situation. A couple hours later his dad comes outside, stands on the front porch, and aims his shotgun at us. We actually had to physically hide behind his pickup truck to avoid being shot. We eventually had a chance to run while he was reloading his shotgun. We ran for about 10 miles down to the nearest town, which actually didn't have a police station. We used this old ladys phoned and called the police. When we testified in court the shitty thing is the dad never got charged. The neighbor lady sworn in and said that us (the 3 kids) made it all up. (I'm guessing she wanted to cover her ass from her husband). The cops didn't even check to find the large amount of bullet holes in the truck. Since then, my friend's parents divorced and they moved 3 states away. I'm always afraid for my life anytime I go into a hick area.
I bought something from them and none of the pieces matched. Didn't realize until after the first use.... and you can't exactly take it back after that....   There is a small one called Father Nature near Orange Blossom Trail and Oak Ridge rd. but I think the old hippies in there are going downhill quickly, they always seem totally out of it..... go figure. New Galaxy Gifts is pretty neat. Kind of pricey but VERY haggle able.  Mysitc is a bunch of overpriced stuff and they don't really want to haggle. Also, it's a piercing place so I don't know how focused they are on their head stuff. 'Lit' is right across from UCF campus. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GO TO LIT. I've been there three times and EVERY time I went, the person behind the counter was a complete douche. I remember once, I saw somthing behind the counter that I wanted to look at so I asked the guy and at first he ignored me, then when I asked again he seemed annoyed and said "one second". He was looking at his smartphone... Up In Smoke is also right across from UCF (but in front of Greek row). I haven't had any bad experiences there, but they didn't strike me as anything too spectacular.
Why don't you see it very often in the UFC or other MMA fights?   As so_very_very said, a lot of it is philosophy. Aikido is not coincidentally referred to as The Art of Peace. Mainstream aikido eschews contests/competition.   There's more to it than this. Aikido doesn't have sparring. Aikido practice is mainly (but not only) paired kata practice. The closest you get to sparring in aikido is when two experienced aikidoka practice randori (pretty much any attack/any defense). Why is this? In part, it's philosophical. But it's also pragmatic. It's simply not safe to practice full-speed (or near full-speed) with someone who doesn't either (a) know what's coming or (b) know how to protect their joints/body from the unexpected. More directly, you'd end up with severe injuries and nobody to practice with.   For example, there's a common wrist turn defense (present in a lot of martial arts) where the wrist gets folded and turned out away from the body. If you know how to react to this, you can move to get safe, take a fall, stymie, or even reverse the technique. If you don't know how to react, and it's done with sufficient speed and force, you get a spiral fracture of the lower arm bones rather than a nice, pretty fall.   But it's more than this too. Aikido was founded by a gifted MA practitioner who sought to combine and distill some of what he'd learned. He knew all about strikes--open hand and with weapons--as did all of his early students (who were almost exclusively experienced martial artists already). These techniques were effective against other martial arts. I dare say the founder of aikido--who was by all accounts exceptionally strong, quick, and dexterous for his size--would have fared quite well in combat with someone with mixed martial arts skills. Over time, though, the philosophy behind aikido, the desire to teach it as a more pure martial art (independent of striking arts), and it's broad appeal led to what we have today, which is still wonderful but lacks the martial edge you get with some other styles. Many (most) aikidoka aren't really savvy today about striking and the heightened focus you get with striking arts. Many aikidoka don't understand how striking and openings for strikes informs the techniques they perform. And teachers often have to resort to other measures (like including weapons practice) to bring a true martial focus to aikido practice.   Most aikido dojos don't train much against kicks. They don't train against jabs; strikes must be committed efforts. So they're not usually well prepared for contests/sporting combat. Conversely, what aikidoka do train on, in good dojos, they do exceptionally well. They train on a relatively small subset of jujitsu techniques and how to apply them from all sorts of attacks. They train with weapons (sticks and knives mostly) and against those weapons. They train against multiple attackers, which is something you're not going to get in a lot of MMA settings.   Another interesting aspect to aikido training is that when you have a couple aikidoka with sufficient experience, they can train together at near full-speed. They don't spar, per-se, so they don't train to pull punches or score points. This can be an asset as well.
Hey guys; long time lurker here looking to give some insight as to why it is unrealistic to expect significant change from the 07scape game mode. Just as some background, I played runescape for about 7 years until pre-eoc, then quit and now regularly lurk on 07scape just to see whats up.   Recently I've been seeing a lot of posts about how the polls are not going through for stuff in dmm, sailing, etc, and just want to point out a few reasons as to why this is not surprising considering the setup of 07scape as we currently know it.   1) Jagex will not risk upsetting the current 07scape playerbase in favour of acquiring a new one due to the outdated nature of 07scape not being competitive with other games in the gaming market. That is to say, the risk of losing current players (due to the game moving in a new, foreign, direction) outweighs the chance they have of bringing new players into the game from the same update. This is because 07scape is far behind other games in terms of gaming experience that they have pretty much saturated their market (i.e. those who play because they played in their teens or before). Therefore their it would not be a leap to suggest that Jagex's current strategy is the retention of the playerbase. (or people who used to play, i.e. bring people who quit back) This manifests itself in things such as the polling system, where the nature of the poll opposes change, since the worth of 1 person saying no is equivalent to 3 saying yes.   2) People who play 07scape do not actually want change, just the illusion of progression. Times have changed, and runescape has changed along with it, by which I mean RS3. Admittedly Jagex could have gone about keeping runescape competitive with other online RPG's in a better way, but that is a different issue. The fact that so many people were still enchanted with the pre-eoc runescape led to the creation of 07scape which by definition is the 2007 version of runescape. Surely it makes sense then that nobody who really enjoyed playing runescape as it was in 2007 and does so now wants to see the game evolve into something else?   3) Lastly we are left with what to do with the devs. Since the general population does not want to see significant evolution of 07scape, the remaining updates are more like QoL changes which are sometimes polled, some of which get through and some not but none of which change the essence of the game. [example of a non polled QoL change is changes to splashing, nmz] However since there are so many different types of scapers: casuals, elites, skillers, pvpers, pvmers and deadman moders to name a few, and the fact that most people vote in favour of self interest, any update has to benefit a large number of these 'factions' in 07scape to go through [think GE], thus any update appealing to just one group (for example, a deadmanmode specific update) is unlikely to go through, because the update will not have the cooperation of the other 07scape factions.   Therefore it is unsurprising that people who want a game significantly different from what runescape was in 2007 are left unsatisfied, because that goes against the nature of what the game is at its core.   Anyway let me know what you think, just some thoughts I thought i might share to get an opinion from y'all.
I try to hang out with friends and do things that I see as fun. If I can get my mind to forget reality in any way then I'm hunky dory. As soon as any minor negative thought creeps into my mind, it all goes down hill and my anxiety sky-rockets.   Unfortunately my family is the biggest cause of my anxiety and depression/anger issues, second to my financial instability. So recently my mental state has been diminishing since I had to move back in with my family due to my financial hardships on my own. So now nothing really eases me anymore since I'm surrounded by the two major causes of my stress 24/7.   I guess the only things that have been even remotely helpful would be exercising, alcohol/weed (I live in Colorado), and going to my therapist every two weeks. And the only way I can afford a therapist is because my parents think that therapy is all I need to get better and will stop me from over-thinking shit and from being depressed.
In my office we fill out  these forms  to fill out a stack of these a day. In an attempt to speed up the workflow, I scanned the form into Acrobat 9 and made form fields. Then I fill them out and it prints only the text. It looks nice, is clearly legible, and is much faster to do. Now that's  okay , except for the fact that every field is independent. There is no "table" field. If I want to add something to the top of the list, I would have to manually move every other item down. I also can't hit enter to go to the next row, but rather have to hit tab 7 times.   The office is Mac based. If need be I  could  switch over my computer, but I'm looking for a long term solution for everyone. Also, it's a small business which is one reason why no one has bothered to optimize the process. The other reason is "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".
so i had just gotten off work it was thursday and thats when the office was at its prime, and i had made some pretty decently good tips, and i wanted to buy two grams.   so i buy two, and end up smoking a healthy serving of bubbler to myself. my bubbler is a pretty beefy bubbler too. Its more of a handheld bong rather than a little bubbler.   anyway. so i power chiefed this thing in my bathroom as fast as possible, cause i was makin a pizza. so i go downstairs and realize...  i still have 8 minutes left...  so i decide to get another bubbler in.   10 minutes later  I am higher than i have ever been in my entire life. i smoked almost the completely forgot about the pizza and it was cooked just right ( i set the timer early to allow for laziness or in this case, stupidity.)   so i go down, and take the pizza out, and cut it and what have you. but i didnt let it cool down and burnt my mouth. so naturally i pack another small bowl to let the pizza cool down.   well, about 10 minutes later, i was deeming myself about to be too fucking high. so i go lay in my sisters bed, cause she had fallen asleep in my room on the couch watching tv, and put on some headphones, and listen to music.   in her room there was 2 closets, and one looked white and peacful, and the other looked dark and demonic. so after a few minutes i bail and go watch tv in my bedroom room by my sister whose asleep on the couch still, and fell asleep with the remote somewhere (definitely aint lookin for that shit right now) so i watch whats on... Its waterworld.   so one of the scenes in the end, i guess i dont know. it had the most ridiculous scene ive ever seen. a guy in a scuba outfit, swam over the camera, like the camera was filiming vertically and he swam over it, and then cut scene to him propelling himself onto the deck of this boat, and landing in the pussiest looking villain stance ever. at this very sight, i start laughing  uncontrollably  i laughed for a good solid 10 minutes or so id say. at one point i had stopped breathing and was just laughing. it was so bad i had to literally wake my sister up. and once i did, i was able to calm down a little bit, but only to the point that i could laugh  and  breathe.   so after another 10 minutes of her freaking out and asking why i woke her up and then her laughing at me...  the paranoia sets in   i suddenly had some chest cramps, and i told her to call 911. literally. but i want to be clear, i was just too high, i dont think i was that close to laughing myself to death. so i told her to call 911, and she literally said this to me, and it totally snapped me out of it..   "im not gonna be that sister that has to call 911 because his retarded brother smoked too much pot"   after that i was like, okay im going to fucking bed.   then... this.... little icing on the cake/ unfortunate set of events   "do you want a glass of milk? that usually helps sober me up a little bit" "oh my god, that sounds delicious"  -3 minutes later- "this milk tastes funny" "shut up and drink it, otherwise clean the kitchen... and why the hell did you take a bite of one fucking pizza and leave the rest out?! thats fucking digiorno in there!" "no seriously drink this..." -swishes milk- "this tastes like shit... clean the fuckin pizza"
I main ADC, and my friends list (outside of my actual friends), are all the supports I've played with, that we've added each other after a game.   My note always includes which champ they main, how aggressive they are, and their teamfight playstyle. I'm kind of an ADC slut.. There's 8 supports that I always play with, and sometimes I wish there was an "invisible" option on the friends list because I have to tell one of the other supps that I'm duoing with another supp... I feel like I'm cheating on all of them :c
After that he probably sat in a corner and started whispering to himself:"Why are they so damn intolerant?!! They oppress me so much!" And after that moment he decide sto stand up, rebel against the fundies with their 'wrong' views on life. He gained confidence and felt enlightened. He was out of cheetos but there was still some Mt. dew left. He drank it all and because of that Scientific( or dare I say Divine) drink he said something so enlightening the world would tremble to its very core: "In this moment I am euphoric not because of some phony gods blessing but because I'm enlightened by my own intelligence" and this is how Aalewis was born.
I'm not quite sure why this is happening to me, but I've been on okc and pof for about 1.5 years now dating, and it has occurred to me that at least 95% of all the women that have any interest in me are as tall or taller than me. I am a 5'9" asian dude, about 162lbs, fit and all, but for whatever reason, I have nearly no luck with shorter women initiating contact/responding/going on date with me.   I actually don't mind dating taller women, but, I feel as if my options have been cut by some 95% (cause according to statistics, only about 5% of women in North America are over 5'8"). Also, most of these women are of average and/or thin weight, and Caucasian.   Is there anyone else in a similar situation as me?
Okay, for those of you who have already read this, feel free to skip to the part where I talk about the cigars... Otherwise... Have at it:   So, a few days ago I was graced with the arrival of my r/Cigars SS gift. And I'll be damned if I don't sing some praises.   Liser, or as I like to call him, -Scribble Signature Sally-, sent me a lovely Canada Post package, which from first feel, I could tell was not just a single, well packaged cigar. Oh no.   When I opened said package, (making sure to keep it as lovely as when I first received it) I was greeted by lovely bubble wrap, the color of a can of 7-Up (green, for those of you who are blind), and inside of that green bubble wrap was a single bottle, of perhaps the greatest sounding beer EVER. It is called "Innis & Gunn", it is a Scottish beer "...with hints of Toffee, Vanilla, and Oak". Now I haven't tasted it yet, as I am waiting for my cutter and lighter to arrive (so I can enjoy it along with a cigar he recommended, not to open the bottle, or anything like that... honest!), but let me tell you, that I am staring at the bottle with the utmost anticipation.   As I delved ever deeper into the parcel, I saw, in the farthest corner, as if it were a treasure waiting to be discovered, not 1, not 2, but a BAG OF SIX cigars. All of which, he described as if Hemingway himself was telling a tale of the adventures I would encounter upon smoking them. (Unfortunately, I have not indulged in any of these sticks, so my descriptions will be barely scraping the surface) Upon further investigation, the contents of the bag were two (I believe) Maduro Ligero Vengeance sticks, two Jose Piedra Cremas, a Jose Piedra Cazadores, and an H. Upmann Regalias. If it weren't so cold out, I would be indulging myself as we speak.   In closing, I would like to say: Thank you, Liser. You have displayed the kindness of a true gentleman, and I wish you only the best in all of your endeavors.   As an added bonus, I would just like to make a big thank you to dlm04e, for being one of the most helpful, friendly people I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. When CI was having their $50 blah blah sale, he offered to have it sent to his house and then ship it to me in Winnipeg, from  Florida . Now, I'm not Magellan, but that's a long fucking way. He kept me posted on updates that he got, and he put up with my boyish excitement. My package arrived today and I couldn't be happier. So, pat yourself on the back, man. You've made me smile quite big :)   And as for the rest of you...   This community is by FAR the greatest community on Reddit. Whether or not we earn the title officially, I would like you all to know, that it is my pleasure and my privilege to call myself an r/Cigars Aficionado.
Too lazy to read your LinkedIn Publisher post in it's entirety...   Give me the
well I see a couple different comments down there relating to "what does it matter?" ... It's really easy being in a majority and feeling like it doesn't matter. But you get to see people like you every day in just about everything you watch. The idea that people like you are significant is all around you. So when we get disappointed that there isn't a gay character, it's because sometimes it is nice to be reminded that people like us are significant too. Sci-fi in particular is pretty good at reminding us that people being different is a good thing.   I'm not implying it should be in every sci-fi book, movie or show. Nor, do I believe that was the purpose of this post. However, for something that is a part of our lives for a few years such as Fringe, I completely understand why it can be surprising and slightly that someone like you isn't represented even once. And I hope my explanation helps you understand a little bit more.
It's more or less impossible for a scripted game to offer a large amount of freedom of choice. The variables just compound and you get a huge branching factor unless you clamp down on the impact of any given decision.   Like in your example, the hypothetical developers minimise the amount the puppy-orphanage timeline differs from the baby-train timeline.   You can have callbacks later on, maybe even change whether certain choices are available (e.g. you might find it hard to get a spare kidney from the mother of that baby you let die in favour of the puppies), but you don't have fully branching timelines.   If you do have full branching, you have to limit the depth.   Basically, a group of developers have a finite amount of "story nodes" they can create. They can either make it broad but shallow or narrow but deep.   The former creates a lot of content most players will never see (a lot of effort for little reward), while the latter leads to the occasional complaint of "restrictiveness".   Now procedural content could theoretically allow full freedom of choice. Of course that comes with its own galactic cluster of problems.
Hello guys, i'm reporting this on reddit because i want to know your opinion, usually when you spray with a weapon you get less accuracy, basically more u keep pressing left click less accuracy you get on your shots. I discovered that if you spam click using soldier:76 you can have the same firerate as a spray but your accuracy is 100%, i think this can be kinda broken, i come from years of CS 1.6 and CS:GO and it's fairly easy for me to aim and spamclick, i went from getting 7-8 kill streak to 20-30 using this method...i don't think it should be like this. To solve this just increase the time that has to pass between shots to reset the accuracy to 100% ( first shot accuracy ).
I'm on my phone at the moment so excuse my poor attempt at redditing.  I would like to just share an experience I have had with you guys.  I don't know how concerned I should be.   Last night I went out with a group of friends to the pub for about 5 hours.  At about 1am we said our goodbyes after drinking more or less 6 pints of lager.   A friend and I went back to his house to smoke some weed then go to sleep at his. I had not a lot at all (I smoke fairly often but not a lot at a time).   Anyway, I didn't feel to well so I decide to tactile chunder (voluntarily throw up, as it'll make the hangover easier to handle the next morning) so I told my friend I will be right back and then processed to throw up in my toilet.  Felt pretty good after that, just a tad dizzy.   That dizziness then just made me accidently fall asleep on the sofa next to my friend.   NEXT THING I KNOW, a group of drunk people ask if I want some pizza and asked if I was alright.  I tried to keep it cool and kindly declined their pizza offers (a sin, I know).  This is when I realised.  I was in town about a 15 minute walk away from my house (walking alongside a very long river).   Why does it feel like I have just woken up? Why is my throat all croaky?  Where is my friend?   ...  How did I get here?   Unsure, I thought I'd just phone him.  Nope.  Left all my possessions in my friends lounge.   I walk home to my friend awake on the sofa asking where I had been.  He looked a little distressed.  He asked where I for the last couple hours?  A couple hours.  Town was only a 15 minute walk.  It was 5am.  Why would someone walk to town at 5am.  All shops are shut.  I explained I have no idea why I walked all the way to town and back or my memory of walking there.   He commented on how well I handled my drink (minus the tactile chunder, but that is voluntary) and how I didn't smoke much weed to explain this type of behaviour.  He said I was acting fine until this happened.   My friend put it down to sleep walking.  I was convinced it was but it's never happened to me before (I live with family, so they would know) and I believe it is a rare occurrence in adults?
I'm stuck in the middle. Been seeing this guy for a year.   Long story short is my boyfriend and my parents are on the opposite ends of the political spectrum. I'm a moderate. My parents are hard core conservatives. Him a huge liberal.   Last night on a political meme posted on MY Facebook my mother and my boyfriend got into it. The meme called one of the candidates a Theocrat and my mother was arguing that he is a constitutionalist not a Theocrat. Fine, Whatever that's what you believe.   My BF would not leave it alone. I kept telling him to drop it and he would not. It descended into name calling, and him calling the candidate a scum bag, and telling my mother to 'get off her high horse'. My mother ended it by saying that she never wants to see him again and he better not be around when they come to visit me this summer.   Other family members have seen this and are appalled by his comments. I'm stuck in the middle. I'm trying to smooth this out. I want my BF to apologize to her for telling her to get off her high horse. I feel it's really a disrespectful statement. I would never dream of speaking to anyone in his family that way.   He just told me he doesn't understand what he needs to apologize for. I told him that he's been disrespectful and needs to tell her that he went overboard with his comments and he's sorry and didn't mean to offend her.   Am I wrong?   Edit to remove candidate/party names and include some more context : She was just defending the candidate in question, talking about his voting record etc. She wasn't being rude to him at all. He commented back to the comment about his record saying 'that's why he thinks he's scum' and when she replied back that he is not scum and he needed to be more respectful that's when he stated the 'high horse' thing. I probably needed to make that more clear.
I was in a relationship with a girl I met while I was working abroad. Now, before me, she had a long term bf of around 5 years but before she came abroad he broke up with her. She used to mention him from time to time and when we talked about our long term plans she would sometimes bring him up. I wasn't looking at this relationship as a long term thing as we both live on opposite sides of the planet (literally) so when we both went home again it may be unlikely it would continue and I was quite accepting of that.   Now we had been together for 2 months and I had went home for a 2 month break from work and we kept in contact a lot for the first while. Then after the first month or so things quietened a bit but I thought this was ok, maybe even a good thing as it would be a bit more fresh when I got back. Anyway it turns out she had started talking to her ex bf a lot more and as she was going home in a few months time they must have decided to try again when she got back and I got a whole long drawn out apology about it and she basically broke up with me without actually telling it to me straight.   Anyway I was a bit depressed about this as she is a really lovely girl and we had been really good friends for quite a while before we hooked up but I got over it and all was good. She wanted to stay friends when I got back and I initially had doubts about this as things felt a bit awkward and I wasn't sure if just being friends would be enough for me. However I just recently got back and she really went out of her way to get in touch with me and see me again so I let it happen although I initially tried to ignore her.   She has been over a few times in the space of a week and we've just been hanging out, nothing much has happened but small things I know about her and small things she has said to me make me think that maybe she wants to continue in a sense, what we had before until she leaves and then it will be over.   First off she is the kind of girl who always needs someone. The one who always has a bf or something similar to that with a male counterpart. This is one of the reasons I think she has decided to get back with her ex as the 2 months I left her alone for, I believe, has gotten to her and she's gotten lonely.   Another thing that I noticed is that she is always getting in contact with me, maybe even more than before. She will try and get me during the day to make sure she can come over during the evening just to 'hang out' When she comes over we'll sometimes just lie on my bed for hours chatting about anything you can think off but then last night it was getting really late and she was saying stuff like she was getting tired and if she lay here much longer she would just fall asleep and that she's really comfortable and that her place is really far and she cant be bothered going back. Before I would have told her to stay but now I wont as I don't know what her intentions are, maybe it's just harmless and she means nothing by it but then again maybe it's subtle hints that she wants a bit more 'fun' while we're together.   I really would love to get intimate with her again as we had so much fun before and it makes the time abroad a lot easier when you have someone like that. Perhaps that's what she's thinking too, I really don't know and that's why I'm asking you guys, because I don't want to be pushy or try something and then be rejected which could then potentially kill out friendship too.   All my friends and even my dad are basically telling me to just push it further (Quite a lot further) but im not really like that I kinda feel like I should leave it up to her to make the first move but then she might think im not interested any more as im not trying so Im kinda stuck.   Im going to see how it goes as I think she might becoming over tonight  or tomorrow night again for a movie night but I would really like any advice on this at all. I know it's trivial and maybe pointless to a few of you but it means a lot to me just now so I would love any input.   Thanks for reading, I know it's long as hell.
I wouldn't be surprised if they did not release one before then unfortunately. The concept is broken to begin with. If there is one, it will be an Aphrodite clone (heal/lane clear + soft cc/damage + some kind of buff skill and/or hard cc + utility ult)that will be used as a support and break high level play.   Or, we get a solo laner Ra/Hel clone that would be intended to break the warrior meta (this I would love to see, throw in 2-3 gods with some weaker healing/heal reduction and a utility ult and just see what happens to the solo lane warriors). Honestly, a Ra/Chang'e hybrid. A heal somewhere between the two that can be used on minions as well as people, a lane clear that is WAY stronger then Chang'es and a utility ult that counters the typical warriors kits. Basically, Chang'e with less focus on her ult.
That the Internet was awesome in 1997. I was a big computer geek in middle school and loved surfing the Internet on my 14.4k modem. It took me 3 days to download my first song on napster (ja rule where would I be without you) and my first Web page was a geocities page in 2000 with a brick wall background that my friends could write messages on and if they emailed me photos I could post them on the picture page. I made a social site for my friends to set up party invites for everybody but it quickly devolved into people pretending to be someone else and posting nasty messages.
WALL OF TEXT!!!!!   I dated a girl in high school. We stayed together through college. She got pregnant and we decided to have an abortion. That really fucked her up, mentally, and she blamed me for it. We ended up getting married (BIG MISTAKE) when she got pregnant a second time (after lying about using birth control and sabotaging condoms). My son was born in 2005, in the middle of my last semester of my undergraduate degree.   I started graduate school the next semester. She stayed home and acted the part of housewife, really poorly. I would come home from school at about 10 pm (I was working on a MS in Physics, so lab work, research, and classes took up a lot of time) and the house would be a disaster, shitty and pissy diapers all over the place, dirty dishes that stank up the house in the sink, etc. So I would clean up a little before crashing in bed. I had early classes, so I would wake up and drive to school pretty early (read that as I left the house around 5:30 am).   Around this time the 'rapes' started. She would come to me every few months and claim to have been raped somewhere. Either at a bar with her sister, or in the alley behind the grocery store, or something. I suggested she go to the police, but she always refused. I thank God to this day she never accused me of raping her. One day she came to the University and came into my office bleeding from her face and hand, telling me she had been attacked and raped and that the cuts were from the rapist. I demanded she go to the police, and drove her there myself. She gave a statement and we left after a nice chat with police about a serial rapist in the area.   A few weeks later she found out she was pregnant. Two or three months later she admits to me that she was never raped, that the cuts were self inflicted, and that she only told me she was raped to make me mad. Oh yea, and that she had been having an affair with my used-to-be-best-friend (we'll call him Joe).   Trying to be a 'stand-up guy' I decide to forgive and move on, as long as she agrees to therapy and marriage counseling. I even agree to raise Joe's son as my own, and he can be Uncle Joe. This works for about a year (by 'works' I of course mean we were all miserable, but I continued going to school and making high marks while she did her business and I pretended not to notice). Then she comes to me and says that he best friend wanted to take a trip to Germany to visit her dying grandmother but didn't want to go alone, so she would go with her. We couldn't afford the ticket, so my mother bought it for her, thinking it would be good for her to relax and get away, and maybe come back a little more sane.   Turns out she just went to Germany to fuck some guy she met on World of Warcraft.   She comes back and stabs me in the eye with the news that she just went there to hook up with someone. I. Lost. My. Mind. I started screaming at her and threw all her shit out of the house. The boys woke up crying, she said some shit about how much better the guy in Germany fucked her, and I punched a hole in the wall.   I also kicked her ass out.   Fast forward to divorce hearings. She tells the judge all about how I yelled at her and punched a wall, and how she was afraid for her safety and that of the boys. Judge eats it up with a spoon. She gives my ex temporary custody.   My ex was living with a mutual friend at this time, and he had insight into her behavior when I wasn't around. After six months of fighting with himself over not wanting to get involved, he finally comes to me and tells me about how unsafe the kids are with her because she gets sloppy drunk and passes out with them in the house, or how he finds her coked out and unable to really function properly while the boys are out playing on the second story balcony (they were only two and four at the time).   A quick list of other shit: she was taken to a mental hospital where she escaped and ran around downtown in nothing but a hospital gown (everyone suspects she was on drugs, but I don't know for sure); she hired a babysitter for the children while she had a short-lived job at the Waffle House, and he turned out to be a convicted pedophile; lots and lots of drug use; multiple occasions where people found her so intoxicated or under the influence that they called her parents to come get the children because they feared for their safety; she spent child support money on plane tickets to California (from Texas) to meet another guy she met on WoW, and told everyone that I wasn't paying the CS when they asked about her not being able to afford essentials for the kids.   I had no idea any of that shit went on, until finally her parents came to me after she had forged several checks of theirs, fed up with her shit.   It took, me, her mom, her sister, her father, a CPS investigator, my friend who lived with her, Joe, Joe's attorney, my attorney, my anger management counselor (mandated because the judge thought I was a risk to the children), and the marriage counselor we had seen to convince the judge that something needed to be changed.   THE HOPE: I now have sole conservatorship of my son. The other boy lives with Joe, who has sole conservatorship of him. She gets visitation 1,3,5th weekends of the month, but supervised, and any extra time is at my discretion. She is supposed to pay child support, but the amount is so trivial as to be nearly worthless (she hardly ever pays anyway), but that isn't what matters to me. What matters is that I know my son is safe.
Remember back when you first started smoking? Remember how excited you were? Remember how you're Google search history looked kinda like:   How to smoke weed   A beginners guide to smoking weed   Weed information   How to roll a joint   How to smoke a bowl   Weed Etiquette   I'm sure there are plenty of older ents here who grew up before the internet, but you get the idea.   What if you could find all that information in the same place? What if it was all available in a series of short (3-5 minute) videos? What if we formed....   (Thunder crack)   ENT UNIVERSITY   We could have a series of "classes" like:   Weed history (weed trivia like the origin of 420, why we pass to the left, etc.)   Stoner etiquette (Why we have the rules we do, "so you just blew the weed everywhere: what to do about it")   Glassware (what each type of piece is and how to use it)   Buying (how to buy from a dealer, how to find a dealer, how to not get ripped off)   and there are plenty more that we could do!   My only concern is that the police might see that a group of mad ents are trying to teach the children our depraved ways, and come after trees. I like trees, and don't want that to happen, so if it is a possibility, we would have to make it a separate website.   All this information is out there on the internet, but I don't know if it has ever been brought together in one place. Would any ents be interested in doing this?
tr_aim on the fastest bots all day long.   No jk, things you should look into are making your game smoother and so more responsive. Good things to start: Chris' fps configs (no theyre not fucking outdated) to get more fps, and MORE importantly net settings from there.   And have this in mind: heavy really doesnt need that smooth tracking. Your gun shoots an invisible solid damage making beam, not bullets. This beam is pretty large, and so you don't need the smoothest tracking to maximize damage. As long as your crosshair is on (or even close) the enemy on close to medium range, you'll be dealing a lot of damage.   Also heavy is heavily positioning (pun intended) so in order to use your awesome tracking skills you get from playing tr_aim on the fastest bots you need to have good positioning.   Good luck and welcome to competitive tf2 :)   Cheers, Byte
I am speaking of things recognized by the US Supreme court and the entire Insurance Industry, very factual information, and people don't like to hear the truth. Lets make it pritty and easy to understand, like fox news.
My husband and I got married a couple years ago and he had intended to take my name (my dad jokingly? suggested it, and my husband thought it was a great idea and asked for my grandpa’s permission to take our family name), but we never finished the name change documentation thanks to his mother throwing a wrench in the works.  When we started planning our wedding we decided that we really wanted to get married in Alaska with my folks as we rarely see them and it’s a beautiful place to honeymoon. Plus we knew we didn’t want a big wedding because my dad and mother fight whenever they’re in the same room, and my dad and my husband's mother can’t stand each other. When we announced our engagement (and wedding date/location), conversations went a little like this:   Wife’s Dad: I know we’ve been tough on him in the past, but EnsuingRequiem has really grown up in the past couple years and we would be honored to accept him into the family, congratulations!   Husband’s Mom: So? It’s just a piece of paper. Want to go to the lake? (She and I don’t get along the best) Wife’s Mother: OMG A WEDDING YAY! (She’s on her 6th wedding…actually she had a wedding dress available for me that she hadn’t worn yet)   So…wedding day comes and we had a perfect small wedding. Husband and I head off for our honeymoon at a big resort and upon arriving he changes his name on Facebook to my surname. Within hours, his mom calls screaming and bawling so loud I can hear her across the room. According to her, this is a slap in the face to his stepfather who legally adopted him when he was 10, and it’s akin to disowning my husband’s ENTIRE family. After several heated arguments (ON OUR HONEYMOON!) he agrees to change his name back on Facebook.   I know it’s traditional for the wife to take the husband’s name, but is it really always necessary? My husband is on his third surname already whereas I have had the same name since birth, and he thought it would be a nice way to honor my family accepting him and also honoring our family heritage as my grandfather does genealogy (fun fact, my last name means “small but mighty”, and I am indeed small but mighty haha). My husband’s family has no interest in genealogy or any clue of their family heritage.  And if it’s a slap in the face to a man’s family for him to change his name, why is that only a one-way street? Kinda hard to think about having children when we have no idea what to put on the birth certificate…
Inspired by ** this   First, some simple background; I run a server providing a few simple services for some people. When two new friends wanted in we ran into trouble because they simply couldn't connect. They couldn't even get ping responses so I had them run traces to my server, they had the same ISP and both their traces ended at a node registered at said ISP. I assumed that it was a temporary outage of some sort and told my friends to just give it an hour or two.   Time passed and the problem remained. Because this isn't quite their area of expertise, I made the call to tech support on their behalf (behalves?) with the simple intent to check what was up with their routing to my ISP. Here's a rough transcript of how the conversation went:   > TSL (Tech Support Lady): Hello, welcome to <ISP> tech support, how can I help you?   > Me: Hi, I'm helping a couple of friends troubleshoot their Internet connections and we're running into problems when they try to connect to a server of mine. I was wondering if you're having any known connectivity issues between yourselves and <my ISP>?   > TSL: Could you please check your router for me? You should have a row of lamps^* at the top, are they all lit up?   > Me: There's nothing wrong with the local equipment, I've got two people who are both customers of yours and they can't connect to my server. I'm helping them troubleshoot the issue through a Google hangout and they're both online on skype. From what I can make out from a trace the issue is in one of your routers. Again, are you having any known problems routing traffic with <my ISP>?   > TSL: (Condescendingly) Dearie^**, you are either connected to the Internet or you are not. If your friends are connected to Skype, there's no problem.   > Me: ... Um, could I please be transferred to someone with an education in how IP and routing works?   > TSL: (Suddenly upset) I've got certifications in several networking technologies, what makes you think you know better?!   At this point I could've mentioned that I worked as a design engineer for one of the world's leading equipment providers in mobile network technology. This is pretty much my bread and butter. I decided against trying to trump her, seeing how upset she got at the mere notion that she didn't know something.   > Me: Please, can I speak to someone more qualified?   > TSL: (Still upset) Why are you calling us if you're not going to listen?! You said yourself that your friends are connected to Skype, that means that the Internet is working!   And with that she hung up. I'm still not sure what the problem was, the fault cleared itself the following morning, my friends' traces now showed that the previously blocking node now routed traffic to another node owned by their ISP before leaving their network. Sigh, all I wanted from her was an answer to a simple question.   ^* This is not a typo or a mistranslation, she actually meant lamps.   ^** I'm unsure of the proper translation here but you get the idea of dearie/sweetie/honey etc.   --
I am a freshman in college, and I have yet to have a girlfriend, let alone kiss a girl. I know some may say that's not important, but let me give you a little insight into my situation.   Right now, I am at a very rough point in my life. I have dealt with anxiety, depression, and OCD for the past 6 years or so, so that may explain some of what I'm talking about. I have no career plans at the moment and I am not doing extremely well in school. I'm doing good, but I could be doing better.   On top of that, I have felt since middle school that I needed a "partner in crime" by my side. I've wanted to have a girlfriend more than anything for a while now, and all of my attempts have failed miserably.   Now, however, I have my eye on a girl in one of my classes. To me, she is extremely beautiful, very energetic and easy going, and I think believe has a number of things in common with me. I've been talking to her (small talk, but it's something) for a couple of weeks now, and I feel as though things aren't progressing how they should be.   We started talking a couple weeks back in class, and eventually I asked her friend if I could join their group outside of the classroom for about 20 minutes. We all chatted, and eventually me and the girl followed each other on Twitter (whatever that means).   The next day that we have class, I see her and her friend sitting down, so I say hello and ask if I can sit down with them again. I did, and nobody really talked a whole lot, but we shared a few laughs and what not. After that, [18F] wanted to get something to eat with her friend, and I asked if I could tag along.   We went to the cafeteria, ate, I asked a few questions, and before you know it we went our separate paths.   Now today comes up; we meet in the elevator going to the top floor, exchange hellos, and went to class. That's when I saw that their guy friend who sits in front of us all the time is sitting in my usual seat.   My anxiety kicks in.   "Why is he sitting here for the first time?" "Did they tell him to sit here because she doesn't want to sit by me?" "Is it because I was too aggressive in trying to get to know her?"   These thoughts happen all the time. It happens.   After class, they went to their spot (where they went the first time we "hung out", and I went home. I wonder what they thought about that.   Anyway, the point I'm trying to make here is that I really want to give it a shot with this girl, but I don't know if it's already too late or she's just not interested. I at least want to try and not give up like I have with previous love interests.   Can anyone point out what I may have done wrong? What I should try to do? If anyone has any follow up questions, I'll respond as quick as I can. Thank you.
I got my girlfriend to play EVE, I kept talking to her about it as I was discovering it and she was taken in by the idea of mining. I helped her by expanding on the tutorials and equipment. She figured out stuff by herself and soon enough she was in a retriever mining to her heart's content.   She dabbles in exploration, missions (she likes courier missions) and ratting as well. I'm happy I managed to properly convey to her the idea of a sandbox game, originally she wasn't interested in combat but she tried it out and enjoys doing it sometimes (of course she really likes to salvage wrecks).   All in all, she takes things even slower than me, she wants to properly understand things before doing them and she knows her limitations (she reacts slowly in combat). Knowing that, I help her fit her ships when she has an extra slot and doesn't know what to do with it, I tell her of equipment she doesn't know exists (I had the same problem when I started, didn't know things existed). Maybe I steer her to passive mods so she doesn't get overwhelmed with activating too many things. It works, she learns, and soon I she's doing it by herself and trying new fits.   We've fought side by side in anoms and missions. We've mined entire ore sites by ourselves in our retrievers. I love how she has explored more systems than me, I've never been to Jita she has on multiple ocasions. I have a blast in knowing I'm in the same universe as she is and that we can meet at any time for whatever reason. I completely understand EVE is not a game for everyone and feel really lucky that she is into it. I got a girl whose definition of "game" was flash and browser games and I thought she would never go for more complex things (she says she doesn't like newer graphics, too real for her, so I fired up Streets of Rage for the Mega Drive), I know many people like that, now she has played games like Diablo (1 and 2), Torchlight, Morrowind and EVE. I am very happy (and obscenely lucky) to see her enjoying herself with the same things that interest me. I loved to follow (and help) her progression into a game as fantastic as EVE is.   I forgot where I was going with this, guess I just wanted to share what I enjoyed so much about getting my future wife into EVE.
Honestly, and you're going to hate this answer, but pretty much the top banks only recruit heavily at target schools (talking Ivies + a few other target schools like Duke, Chicago, etc.). So if you're at one of those target schools, great, go to the on-campus recruitment events. Otherwise you're going to have to just do a resume/cover letter drop with some random careers e-mail or apply online.
Meh ive only seen tetshio but to me hes just hard to understand (cause his accent probably) and the videos Ive seen he doesn't really seem to know exactly what he's doing.  For example he uses filler words a lot (words such as: like, umm, etc.) Also he acts as if hes going into the video blind and doesn't have a plan of what he wants to do in the video and the way he wants to do it.  Lastly, he doesnt seem to know a ton about the pack(s) he's playing and as a result he cant really explain what something does or how it does it, it's as if he just knows it works but doesn't know why it works
Okay so bear with me on this one, I'm usually great at giving advice etc. but with this girl I'm shit out of luck. Little background, I went to college with this girl and we were freshman roommates, we ended up hooking up once Junior year and then once Senior year (which we will get back to later.) This is a big problem, because it severely disadvantages me from a counseling point of view because it's probably hard for her to believe my advice is not prejudiced. The thing is she lives far far away (Korea) and I really have no intention of being romantically involved with this girl again. You may doubt me on this, but know that if I was lying i would be basically wasting your time, so try to trust me that I don't have those kinds of feelings for her and am really just trying to help. You might then ask, well if you're potentially biased, why not let her other friends help her on this one? Unfortunately her Korean friends do not know the other guy [22M], the history, or the current situation at all, so it kinda seems like if I don't help her, no one will.   Okay so here's the real story about their relationship. First of all they are both very interesting and unique people, and before all of this is I was technically friends with both of them (the girl more though).   The guy is a bit... eccentric, and also has had a crazy life in terms of overcoming adversity/monetary challenges. He also had a pretty bad reputation on campus for his social manipulation, how he would always try to get people to smoke him up etc., basically not many people liked him and for good reason, he put on a huge mask in public (he was definitely a bit better if you got him 1v1, would stop filling every silence and making goofy faces, etc). This is I believe part of what leads her to believe that what other people think about them is inadmissible evidence because they don't know the real him, etc.   The girl is also a bit eccentric, albeit less so (very into philosophy and neurobiology), and they both are music geniuses (by senior year she was the girl playing the grand piano and he was doing the haunting violin solos, both of whom were focal points/features of the orchestra).   They started dating Senior year, and I wished them well. Early on the cracks started to show. Without dragging this out forever, lets just say they fought a lot, constantly cycled between together and not, and really just couldn't stay stable. ALL her friends wanted her to bail. I wasn't as strongly minded and while I did continue to point out how he was perceived on campus, I also pointed out that I knew him better than most so I could kinda understand. Then things got really bad regarding him having severe depression/putting pressure on her to save his life so to speak. She really tried to talk herself out of it, and I remember her ASKING ME to give her a long pep talk this one night to help her muster up the courage to end it even if he ended up killing himself. They broke up for a day. As senior year drew to a close, at some point I thought they had finally ended things and we ended up drunk (she bought me the beer) and going back to my place. It turned out they had broken up THAT DAY, I was a textbook rebound fuck, and she was back with him by the end of the week. He doesn't know about this. I stopped giving advice, and then we graduated.   Fast forward about 7 months, I'd gotten back in touch with her and turns out he came to visit her recently. In Korea. For three weeks. Now remember that part I said before about him being monetarily challenged? Well she had a decent gig at samsung and he worked up some money to make this possible. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for kids who feel in love saving up money to see each other. But the insane part is that she spent so much money having this guy visit that now that he's gone (and her job has a built in hiatus), she'll be living on $10 a day for food for a while. She says she feels weak. That shes not eating. But that it was still worth it. I'm glad she feels this way, but here I am essentially watching this girl be unable to shake an ADDICTION, and no one else is going to pull her out of it if I don't. But again, I'm like the helpless parent (although more complicit) in this situation, all advice from me is not going to resonate strongly enough to break whatever dependency she has on him. It's like watching someone date Doestoyevsky or Van Gogh. Yeah they are incredibly talented and deep/brooding individuals, but anyone with two eyes and a semi-complete understanding of the situation can see that it's not healthy to be spending all the money you just made out of college on a three week binge visit.   Now who knows, maybe they have found a way of stabilizing things. Some of the fighting before was due to a previous girl in his life, who is probably less of a factor now. Still, I have to imagine if his monetary issues help spawned the depression in the first place, then things aren't likely to change soon based on their spending behavior (unless she covered more of the trip than she lets on.)   Otherwise, I just don't know how to get through to her reddit, I've explained all of this to her. I have considered a nuclear option, which would be telling the guy about that one night, hoping it splits them up, and sacrificing my friendship with her in the process. Unfortunately, even if I tried that there's no guarantee I wouldn't just be removing the one person who can help her from the equation (myself), and I'd rather not attempt something so invasive anyway.   Am I crazy for even considering that? Should I just let her be stupid, spend all her money and hope they somehow find a way to make it work/that he doesn't keep threatening to kill himself? I just want her to be the successful person she should be, and I just don't think she can until she breaks the addiction. Maybe I'm wrong though, I'm missing a lot of the details from the last 7 months.   What do you think reddit?
We've been together for about 2 in a half -- 3 years. We go so well together, he's everything I want in a guy. We laugh more than we fought, had more good times than bad. Great sexual chemistry, but for some reason I felt like he always had this vulnerable wall up. Seemed to be afraid to be romantic, not a fan of labels/titles. We stayed committed. He wasn't able to tell me he loved me until he left to basic training for the national guard. He was there for 6 months. We stayed together during that time, our relationship seemed to have grown so strong. However, because of the duration of 6 months, prior to him leaving for basic training he wanted to break up - i respected it and felt like maybe we needed to grow independently, but then as soon as he was there in training he changed his mind. He wanted to be with me, he wrote me such loving letters. When we were able to talk he kept up this future of us. In the interim, i was at his house helping his parents, being faithful, being there for him, being so excited to see him. He came back from the national guard and broke up with me 3 days after returning. He's all of a sudden not ready for a relationship and says he can't love me the way i love him. i was perplexed. He says he isn't sure he wants to move on from me or get over me. He wants to stay in contact but i said no, we can't have contact, unless you want to really have a serious conversation we cant just be buddies. Sucks cause we were each-other's best friends. Im just so devastated and sad. Confused. Unsure. It feels like things we so right. And it feels so wrong to be apart.
I can't figure out why, but for some reason I have extreme problems pronouncing бутерброд. I mean, certain words are obviously going to be quite difficult but I usually can eventually pronounce them correctly. Бутерброд is so far the only word that I have come across that, for one reason or another (possibly rolling both р's), is impossible for me to pronounce. Also, does it honestly matter if I can't roll both р's? I ask you /r/russia for advice on this.
While in Darkroot I figured I'd go kill the original Havelmonster for his ring, so that I can fastroll in something that is not litteraly a potato sack and a robe.   When he was low, I tried to finish him off with a 3rd GHSarrow ( holy cow, this spell is way too strong for my level), but I underestimated his damn reach, resulting in a mace to the face and thus a mutual kill.   I come back, there's no ring on the ground, and none in my inventory. Reloading doesn't help :(.   Am I just very unlucky or is that frequent? Is that the game telling me to git gud and not use OP sorceries against real manly men like  Dwayne  Havel the Rock?  Or maybe he's a hacker and using unperm gear?
I've got a good friend who I used to workout with.  Like you, he played football and was big.  In fact the reason we stopped working out together is because we have different needs.  I gotta put on muscle, he has to lose fat.  I think its cardio bunny time man.  My friend is stronger than me cuz turns out, under that fat is muscle to carry it.  So when he did lose a bunch of the fat he was super jacked already from carrying weight around for years.  So just do cardio dood, the weights will come later: Walk, bike, swim, row, and jog eventually.  And work out hard.  30 minutes is totally fine, hell 5 minutes walking the dog is way better than nothing.  But at least a couple times a week it should be VERY hard.  Like not able to hold attention reading a book hard.  Conversation should be strained by shortness of breath.  Your brain will start to shut down and you’ll get dumber (like all facts you usually know easily, say your boss’s name or what project you’ve been working on at home for the past 6 months), you will be only able to focus on your own sweating perpetual pain.  Do like a 10 minute warm-up on the bike and then do a series of on a minute off a minute really hard and rest, for the next 20 minutes.   And when you’re done you’ll feel great!  But please start slow, for physical overtraining and injury reasons first, but also for mental reasons.  Getting burned out mentally is the number one reason athletes stop competing and people drop all these diets and stuff.  Go slow and work up to those longer more strenuous workouts (there’s no real timeframe here just over then next few years probably); get pumped to go by listening to loud music, yelling in the car, cursing society and yourself, and dragging yourself out of that hole by sheer determination.  You want this for you, for your wife, for your daughter.  And remember when you don’t wanna go that once you get to the gym you’ll usually get into the mood by the time you leave.  Plus how often do you regret going to the gym?  Unless you miss a family event man, probably not nearly as often as regretting not going.  And past that just know that it comes and goes.  Sometimes it’s totally cool to go, other times you hate it.   Diet seems to be more on track I think, just try and drop the fast food.  People give eating healthy this bad name but just go for the good stuff and it’s totally fine: Grilled veggies are awesome with just salt, pepper, and garlic.  Frozen chicken breasts with salt and pepper off the grill in BBQ sauce are great.  Chocolate milk w/ some protein powder and Nesquick is nearly as good as a milkshake.  Frozen berries with vanilla yogurt and granola dumped on top is an amazing dessert.  Salad isn’t so bad if you put roasted bell peppers, cut lunch meat, and cut veggies in it with just a tiny bit of dressing.  Fresh fruit cut into slices is sweet and yummy.  Video games and movies are a great distraction to food.  So is sex.  Pack your lunch for work the night before with tons of healthy stuff and leave your wallet in the car.  Workout before work if possible so you can go straight home from work.  Or workout on your lunch break.  And as you eat the unhealthy stuff less and less (try to have as little of it around work and home as possible) you stop craving it.  That doesn’t mean that the cravings won’t come back and it won’t take all you got to only have 2 cookies when there’s a whole damn plate in front of you.
It also depends on the person. I grew up being told the whole "drugs are bad" thing. Except alcohol and coffee, I tried none until I was 18. Second or third time I smoked weed, I started getting really curious. Something like "if something considered mild is this awesome.... What else can I find and try?!?"   So I started actively researching possibilities on erowid, and ended up making a pretty long list of things to try.
are you trying to say that wii u is less powerful than a ps3? seriously?   Yes and No. Yes in that all the engines have already been optimized for it, and a lot of games are able to take 100% advantage of the hardware available. This comes from both 7+ years of development time available on the machine, teamed with the fact that there is a large (75+million sales to date) player base, and thus incentive to develop for it. No in that, hardware wise, the PS3 is marginally less powerful than the Wii U. The Batman example is just showing that the refinement done on the PS3, that is already in place for the engines that Dice is developing, is much MUCH further along than the refinement that is done/available/known about, on the wii u. (remember when the PS3 originally came out, games were lagging on it compared to the 360 because of the ease of development on the 360, and the similarity to the xbox1 and PC which gave xbox a HUGE advantage 'performance' wise over the PS3.)   It boils down to this. The 360/ps3 are well developed for, and it's not a lot of money to make a game look REALLY good on the 360/ps3 because the available performance is already there. The Wii U is new, and less popular(compare 600k-700k sales/month on the 360/ps3 - 200k sales/month on the wii u, stats in another post of mine here) and engines aren't well refined and will cost a lot for relatively low returns. In the Next Gen war, the PS4/720 will be using X86 architecture meaning that they will be even easier to optimize for because PC's use the X86 architecture as well, and well... all games exist on pc already.... (yeah yeah exclusives...).
I feel the need to intervene here ! Rift DK2 Owner reporting in.   First of all, I encountered a major problem with the Rift that I didn't encounter on any other game/demo. The first time I launched E:D, I was amazed, by the scale, details, etc,... BUT there was obviously a problem with colours and resolution. When I looked at the space, there were some some very dark part and I could see a clear demarkation between the pixels that were shut down, and the ones that were just lit up. That came with massive black smearing.   That got to me. I thought that yeah, It is a fun thing to "experience" but you can't really play the game that way.   I launched the game again three days later (I switched my main monitor to the Rift in the meantime) and the problem was gone. It changed everything. I can't imagine playing E:D without the Rift now. Dogfighting is so intense, when you have your target coming right at you, it makes you sweat.   A lot of games/demos works flawlessly with the right combination of tweaks. It takes time but it is the price to pay for being the first people to experience such a new gaming experience. Don't give up, you are beta tester, testing is what you should do. Discovering and understanding why and how certain things work is half the fun with a DK2.   Yes, the resolution is not perfect yet and you might have to lean a bit to read perfectly but it is not a deal breaker if you accept the fact that the DK2 is already amazing and that you get to be inside a freaking spaceship gloriously blazing through space shouting "PEW-PEW FRAMSHITDRIIIIVE CHEWY".   I noticed that some people "get" the Rift way better than others. It is not related to expectations but more to your brain accepting virtual reality. Some people just instantly get in the experience and are amazed while others are "meh, you can see the pixels". The flaws can be ignored if you are willing to ignore them, it takes time and getting used to the technology.
Why is it important to categorize the evening? Are you expecting something in particular?  If so don't.  Get to know each other.  Maybe you should talk about proxemics and how physical closeness and casual touch may be interpreted differently, because you "don't want to make a blunder unintentionally."   Would you still be willing to go out if she doesn't consider it a date?  Forcing her to categorize it may scare her.  If you are the sort that won't want to go out with a friend, or couldn't have a chinese girl as a friend, ....   In several biracial (western man Chinese wife) the westerner didn't meet the wife's friends and family until we'd discussed marriage.  Different families are different, but behavior and identity are more clearly distinct concepts in China.  I knew of men who said they weren't gay, but were in serial gay relationships because what they did did not define what they were in the same way it does for westerners.  So your need to define things may not help the way it would with a Westerner, - if that works with westerners  (any women on this thread?)   Do you know if her family is here with her?  BTW: wouldn't be surprised if the folks who own or run the restaurant are family or friends who are like family.  Treat everyone you meet that night with respect.  If Family is here that's a powerful force.  If not she's vulnerable and you be a gentleman dammit.  Even if family isn't there- it is huge.  Edit:
So I completed the MSF course a few weeks ago, got my M on my license, and then just yesterday tried out a couple motorcycles. I discovered that the CB500F is a perfect match for me, what with it have a good amount of power while still feeling safe enough for someone who is still new to riding. Only problem is that I can't afford a bike that expensive... So I'm asking /r/motorcycles for any suggestions of older possibly used bikes that offer the same type of ride. Thanks!!
Just got back for wal mart...offer is somehow not available in stores...wasted a good 45 minutes trying to get a manager in the place.  When she finally arrived she was a cunt from the get to.  And before anyone starts in on me, I was very polite I just didn't understand how they can advertise it online and ONLY match it while the online store had stock (so I was told).
Don't get me wrong, I loved the new map and game mechanics introduced this year, but Valve never corrected the mistake's of last. If anything they amplified them.   It all started before last year's event. The hype was building, community cosmetics were rolling in, then I saw it, Medic-Medes. Slowly but surely another four were released. I knew then that I had to have the Medic and Demo bird heads, that was my lone mission. After spending a cumulative week of solid gameplay, and the rest of the time on gift idle servers, I finally found one of the five, the Heavy's bird head, along with a few duplicates of most of the other cosmetics I couldn't care less about. This was disappointing, but I steeled myself that I would get them next year. In the mean time I used model edits to pretend I had them. They were glitchy, I could only see them, and they got patched over every update.   Fast forward to this year. I knew I wanted the new animal cosmetics from this year, but I held strong on my goal. After weeks more of gameplay and every other minute on gift idle servers, I got three more copies of the Heavy bird head, and one for the Sniper. All but one of the transmogrifiers yielded duplicates, the new cosmetic not being feathered in the least naturally.   Now I'm stuck with even more untradable costumes and not one of the two bird heads I was looking for. In the past two years I've earned a BS in computer science, and gained enough know how to start making a tool to replace models quickly and more stably. It still doesn't seem like I should have to modify my game to pretend I have something in TF2 that should otherwise be readily attainable. In this way, Scream Fortress 2009 had it down. The cosmetics were so plentiful that no one could make a significant profit, and you could generally find someone on any given server to swap with. The scout hording was annoying, but that's what the player-exclusive drops were supposed to fix.
Sorry, but being a girl sucks. All the guys with a great job or have good looks or have ANYTHING going for them that's listed tend to become arrogant assholes. That's a sweeping generalization, I know, but being a pretty girl with smarts... I'd prefer my guy to have some hang ups because he may be more down to earth and appreciate my company more than a sports fan, dude always at the gym, or whatever. Give me a guy that doesn't like sports and prefers staying, playing video games or board games, some sex...  Let's stay in!
If you don't believe in any degree of personal freedom whatsoever...well, I'm actually quite certain you do whether you've had to think about it much at all.  Even in communes individuals have personal freedom, they just aren't supposed to own things and labor (or whatever philosophical construct they're working towards).  I also think you get the point that everyone likes a degree of personal freedom, you're just being an ass because you want to bitch about a group of people who aren't your group.  Factionism and all that.  It's just about the only useful point to political definitions.  It allows aggregation of voting power via unity where none existed previously.  Your faction can now beat another, but you give up your individual beliefs in the hopes that the faction's purposes will match yours to a reasonable degree.   > property rights as a concept are what allowed the strip mine to do that in the first place.   <sigh> No, no they don't.  Not in the "first" place (law and manipulation come later).  Power does that.  With no property rights whatsoever the strong can take from the weak, and they do with regularity.  Property rights are purely legal constructs like most lawas.  They can protect you or they can fuck you and it all depends on the situation.  Are you honestly attacking the basic concept or are you pissed off that mineral rights/oil etc are aggregated by big business?   I'm not after libertarian solidarity, I'd be pretty happy if people would make a real effective attempt to get along and understand each other and that  starts  with seeing where their point of view comes from as well as where they agree.   I want you to not be pissed off when you hear "libertarian"...I don't want you pissed off when you hear any simple statement of this sort.  I'd like you to say "Hey, you like socialized health care systems? So do I! I wonder what else we have in common?"  then I'd like you to say "Oh, we really disagree about how to approach problem X.  Why do you think so?  Well, that's understandable but I really think we disagree about Y assumption and here's why."   Avoiding all frothing at the mouth bullshit that prevents people from having an effective and useful discussion is the point.  Politics and political discussion is barely better than apes in kindergarten.  "Your side bad! My side good!" is almost the only thing that's repeated.  Over and over some minor difference is brought up...hell, most of the philosophical differences are bullshit, they're only there for votes.  Notice how Republicans even had a semi-public discussion about abandoning religious extremism after they lost in 2012?  I did.  Notice how there's only been one or two votes on gun control recently and all while the public was watching?  Nationally it got shot down in flaming wreckage and it's not being pushed again.  At the end of the day none of these details matter to the people in power and they mostly don't matter to me.  Life and death matter to me, suffering matters to me, happiness and improving the world matter to me.  Do you not see class hierarchies and environmental issues as people fucking with things that affect you?  Your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man's nose begins.  This readily extrapolates to large-scale environmental poisoning as it affects everyone.   ...also, why the hell would I care about whether environmental issues are a subclass of government harm?  This is what I mean about assuming shit.  Environmental damage is an effect produced by life.  Large scale damage is possible through large scale operations but also through people simply being alive (oil runoff etc) and going about their business.  Preventing, where possible, the tragedy of the common is a perfectly reasonable purpose for government.   ...shit, I'm the token commie/socialist/leftist in my office, I just use individual freedom from oppression as a core philosophical starting point.  That doesn't mean I think it extrapolates to everything you want to be pissed off about in national politics, it's just something I find useful.  When it doesn't fit the current situation I look for other things like Marxist tradition or social group theory.  When nothing seems to work I look for something that has.  Austrian economics isn't my strong suit and I don't care that it isn't.   ...so.  BE NICE.  There's your
I'm in a weird situation and I'd love some feedback...just feel like no one can relate and my friends are sick of hearing about this.   I [22f] met and fell for an amazing guy[25m] while studying abroad. We were together for 3 months before I had to move back to the other side of the ocean. We always said we'd stay friends no matter what, and had sort of an understanding, or a maybe just a wish, that we'd get back together if we ended up in the same country again. And at the moment my plan is to move back there once I graduate.   We've been in various levels of contact since I've gotten back. Right now we message each other maybe once a week or every two weeks on facebook and have Skyped a couple times.   Whenever we talk he's still very flirtatious and tells me how much he misses me and wants me to come back soon and how much he cares about me.   Months have passed and the rose-colored glasses have faded. I'm realizing he's not that great of a guy, and he's not the guy for me. He can have kind of a harsh personality, he has no direction in life and is barely getting by economically, he's religious and can be very judgmental, he's flaky and blows me off.   I'm moving back to the other country, where he is, after I graduate. I've told him this and I think he assumes we'll get back together, but that's not what I want. I don't want to be his girlfriend.   So I just don't know what to do. Part of me doesn't even want to be friends with him anymore because I feel like I should just move on, but part of me is also afraid if I make it clear we're just friends he'll stop talking to me and maybe I don't want that. I don't know if he's still waiting on me or just keeping me as his back up girl. I don't want to give him false hope but at the same time I never said I wanted to get back with him. And when I move back he is one of the only people I know that still lives there, maybe it'd be nice to see him every once in awhile, but I don't want to fall into being with him again.   What do I do? Should I spell it out for him or just lay back and see how things go? Should I cut off contact or maybe let it fade away? And if I do say something what should I say?? How direct should I be?
Whoosh" would imply that I missed something, whereas the comment in question explicitly said "there was no supply glut" after explaining the cause of the supply glut.
Hi! I divorced with my ex-husband a few years ago after finding out that he's cheated on me multiple times and bragged about it to many of his friends. Our relationship lasted in total 6 years and he apparently started cheating after we'd been a few years together.   He comes from a f*d-up family. Probably due to the fact that his childhood wasn't the happiest one, he has trouble being alone. I guess he just wants to feel accepted. He cannot commit though and, as I've later learnt, he has cheated on all his previous girlfriends at some point too. I'm no longer angry at him for being an ass, and I just feel sorry for him for being so lost with himself. He hasn't been alone after our divorce. He's been seeing his newest girlfriend for a few months. Some of my friends have met her and she sounds like a really nice and smart girl.   I ran into my ex randomly about two months ago and while we were chatting just this and that. I told him I was pregnant (I've been together with my boyfriend for two years, met him a year after divorce). Even though I'm not yet far along with the pregnancy, I'm over the moon happy to be a mom. :) Ex said he was happy for me.   I met with a friend yesterday and learnt that three weeks after talking to me, ex proposed the new girlfriend and they are getting married in a month! A month. First of all, I cannot understand why the rush? They are not "just" getting engaged, but married! Also, my friend pointed out that him proposing so soon after finding out I was taking new steps in my life is hardly a coincidence? And my friend also knew for sure that the girl is not pregnant. Because that would have been the only logical explanation for the tight schedule.   I don't know if it's the pregnancy hormones talking, but I started to feel really bad for the girl. She probably has no idea this guy is a cheater and does not know him well enough to see that he needs to spend the money on therapy, not on a wedding. Also, I wouldn't want to get married (or do anything else for that matter) to show off to someone.   So, the question is: should the girl know what she's getting into, or should I just watch her go through the same shit I did? When we broke up, I kept saying that I wish someone would have warned me. At first, I thought this is not my problem, and I don't want to come across as a jealous ex. But then I keep thinking that if there was someone who could have stopped me from marrying him, I would have been forever grateful. Or I might not have believed them?
It's funny how these things seem to drag on. At the start of the encounter, when Police fail to positively state some form of RAS (ANY other answer than a positive identification = no RAS) therefore, there is no power to enforce a detention or arrest.   I struggle to see why/how the youtube vids we see or any interaction with someone who knows what they're about could get into the 10-15 minute mark (or longer).   Basically, when the officer says he wants to talk to you and you have inquired (in any format, not just the formal "am I being detained" etc) if he has any reasonable suspicion (based on a fact of some form)... if he does not directly state something that indicates he actually has a RAS, then the interaction should be over.   Yet people engage in the (voluntary?) circular discussion the Police are trained to get you into... where people just repeat "Am I being detain or am I free to go?" and the cop just repeats his questions/demands/vague accusations  without directly answering your initial question.   The bottom line is that once you've directly told the cop you do not  wish to talk to him, any further interaction will be because you are detained (with RAS) and you've then asked if he has RAS...   Then ANYTHING the cop then says that is not a specific "Yes I have RAS and it is XYZ" is the same as if he'd said "no I don't have RAS". (Even though they don't actually say that.)
I have played fallout, I have watched FiM, and I considered myself a brony for some time but I've recently gained new interests. As I said before its a great story which I really enjoyed reading and I wasn't criticising the story itself.   What I do criticise is the way bronies tend to put anything to do with FiM on a pedestal and I think this is particularly true for FOE. FOE is great but there is plenty of other great literature out there and when people make statements such as:   >Fallout: Equestria is by far one of the most amazingly deep works that I have read, fanfiction or otherwise.   I get annoyed and wonder just how much literature they have read. I'll admit I myself am not particularly well read compared to others but I would never refer to FOE as deep when it's just a fairly straightforward adventure novel.
I studied urban planning, and one focus of our study of Detroit was the overdevelopment of highways within the city and surrounding areas. If you look at Detroit on google maps you'll see what I mean. Detroit is an extreme example of the effect cars have had on the north American landscape.   In contrast with NA, European cities generally developed before the car dominated the landscape. They maintain high land values in their core, have effective mass transit systems, and are desirable places to live. The effect of early and unrestricted development Highways in American cities, and Detroit in particular, allowed people with enough money to move out of the city, into the green, open, leafy suburbs (imagine the 50's american dream, white picket fence homes). Racial tensions expedited this process. The result is money leaves the core, and you ended up with a centre with no wealth and no real land value. In Detroit, as the auto industry shed jobs, the suburbs also fell into decay.   Related, underinvestment in mass transit. IIRC, tire manufacturers also facilitated this by buying up and replacing the rail transit systems (no tires) with buses (tires) of many american cities. Before cars dominated, suburbs arose along & in close proximity to the rail lines that spread out from the city core. The result at the time was: There is no effective mass transit, Therefore everyone drives, Therefore traffic is terrible, and Finally let's build a new highway! Ofcourse, the end result is that the new highway temporarily helps traffic, makes it easier for more people to move even further from their job in the city, and stretches the population beyond the range at which any transit can be effective.
Hi, I will be short, and I need advice. So I have girlfriend that have few groups of friends. Most of them are single (90%) but I am interested in one group. There are one other girl (23) and 2 dudes (28 and 30), they are all single. And in more that 1 year of hanging out with her she didn't really introduced  me to them. We were together for about 1 month when I met them at her birthday and she introduced me as (Name), not boyfriend.   I didn't have problems with that we were together just 1 month then but what pisses me off is that sometimes we have plans like going to specific place and she is like "Ok, we will go there tomorow" and then that group of friends ask her same question and she is ready to go today. Without me, I am not invited, nothing. And that didn't happened one time. I have few friends and everybody knows her and if I am going somewhere I always ask friends or her to come with me. But this is not case with her. They usually go to cinema, bowling, museums, parks etc. and even after 1 year she didn't invited me or introduced.   We almost live together and she met my friends, family and i met her family etc but this bothers me.
A last August my then boyfriend broke up with me due to him not being able to say 'I love you'  after seven months and was afraid the feelings would never come.  I was willing to try and keep it alive but he wasn't having any of it,  so we split.  It was a rather amicable end but it still hurt pretty bad.  I had taken on a massively heavy course load in hopes of being able to escape with him for the weekend,  so I was left hanging with a lot of stress and no outlet.  I don't blame him,  I'd rather he be happy alone or with someone else than stranded with me.   As I said,  it hurt and I wanted to give myself time before even beginning to look again.  It was about six months out that I reinstalled a dating app. I got plenty of good and bad messages and went out on a few dates but I never clicked with any of them on a romantic level.  Sometimes not at all. I don't really have a way to meet anyone the "natural"  way as I live in the middle of nowhere.  My nearest neighbor is five miles away and town is  30 minute drive.  But after a few months of failed dating, I kinda started to give up on the app.  I wasn't really lonely, but I did miss having someone to hold me.   In my downtime,  I like to game.  Anything from stupid little browser sites to mmos to fps.  And I made friends with guildies and other players.  Some of them I added to Skype and even though I don't really play the game we met on anymore,  we keep contact.  Daily,  actually.  Hell,  there's hardly a time when we're not talking. Skype calls, phone calls,  messages and texts.  Recently he's expressed a "more-than-friendship"  feeling towards me.  And I'd be lying to say I don't feel the same.   However, I've kinda always been wary about dating online.  It kinda weirds me out and I just never see a future in it.  And we talked about it and I told him so.  And while he understands, he wants me to consider it.  I'm pretty inexperienced with dating as is, the aforementioned ex is the only one I have.   So,  I'm really asking for advice.  Should I go for it?  Should I not?  If I do,  what things differently should I do than a physical relationship? Have any of you had experiences with relationships that start online?  How did they end up,  was it worth it?
cRedditor, Dont lump me in with those racist pedophiles.   Its an absolutely terrible cartoon that at every level fails. These episodes are funny precisely because they are layered with the annotations. Not everyone is enamored with your high brow victorian era humor.
That is a really bad idea. The pumps in AIO coolers are specifically designed to have enough head pressure to supply the one radiator with a adequate flow rate. When adding another waterblock it increases the resistance of the loop by quite a bit. This means that the pump will have to try very hard to get the liquid through the loop, and it will have a lower flowrate. The AIO will overload and fail quickly, while yielding poor temp performance For comparison the Antec has a peak power consumption of 2.6 watts while a D5 pump has a peak at about 30 watts.
Hi /r/sex - long time lurker, first time poster.   About a week ago on Thursday 8th August I (21f) had sex twice (using a condom). It was the day after my period had finished. That Saturday night (the 10th) I had sex again, with a condom, but as we were quite drunk and being a bit rougher than usual it slipped off inside me. I noticed pretty quickly, and it was before he had finished. I fished it out and he put another one on and we continued as normal.   The next morning, now sober, I obviously panicked, and he reassured me he hadn't finished, which I believed, as there was no evidence whatsoever in the first condom. This wasn't reassurance enough though because of precum and I'm naturally paranoid, and although I was pretty early on in my cycle I went and took the morning after pill just in case. The pharmacist who sold it to me also said it was unlikely I'd fall pregnant (and this was without me telling her about the semen situation) just based on my cycle, but it was wise to take it anyway.   This would all have been fine, but this morning five days after taking the pill I noticed brown discharge. I have absolutely freaked the shit out of myself by thinking its implantation bleeding, even though I almost definitely wasn't ovulating at the time of sex, AND I took the morning after pill within 12 hours. (For the record my cycle is around 32 days, so ordinarily I'd be ovulating probably now or within the next couple of days).   I guess my main questions are - has anyone else had this discharge after the morning after pill, and when is the earliest I can take a pregnancy test? I have taken the morning after pill but off the top of my head cannot remember having these symptoms, but the previous times I've taken it has not been so early on in my cycle.   And don't worry... it's made me realise that someone as paranoid as me really, really should be on the pill. The other reason for my paranoia is that I leave for an overseas trip in only 3 weeks.
Also, If it is indeed a cube, The depth would have to be somewhere between (8 x 6.14 = 49.12 inches) and (19 x 2.61 = 49.59) Let's say half way between these two values, so 49.355 inches.   A brand new dollar bill is 0.0043 inches thick. Therefore 49.355/0.0043 will yield 11477.9 or about 11478 dollars. 11478 x 19 x 8 is about 1.75 million dollars. This means for it to be $1 million it needs to be about 28.3 inches deep.
As I was in school today, I overheard a conversation about rage comics.   Guy #1: Do you ever read rage comics?   Guy #2: What's that?   Guy #1: You know, trollface, Yao Ming face, and all the other poorly drawn faces?   Guy #2: Oh. Those have names?   Guy #1:Yes, those are trending pretty well, lately.   I thought to myself, "I liked those a while ago, before these people liked them." Then I realized that I had a hipster moment.   I don't read rage comics anymore, fortunately.
See, you cannot pick and choose qualities like that. Agreeable, for example, is a very generic term. He might treat you like a goddess, but others like shit. Would you be ok with that? How about if he treats everyone like they're made of gold? Both fall under the loose "agreeable" term. As long as you two get along fine, that should be all that matters.   Handsome is something you can more or less control, by only accepting requests from/asking people you find attractive, I suppose. However, keep in mind that this is highly subjective. You might think you have the hottest guy on earth, when every other single female on the earth would sooner sleep with a death-row inmate then spend another minute in the same plane of existence as him.   Remember, there's a holy triangle. Intellect, looks, personality. Only two of these can manifest themselves in major amounts.  [gross overgeneralisation, but as a rule of thumb, it works]. Smart and hot? Probably going to make you cry. Smart and nice? Yeah, all those nerds you shunned all throughout highschool. Great personality and hot? Think of the stereotypical football player, wouldn't hurt a fly, but dumber than rocks.   [again, generalisation]
When I started watching I hated Bellamy and now he is my second favorite character. I think his development made sense.   While on the Ark he really only had his mom and Octavia, was told he was responsible for his sister and had to help provide for her for 16 years. It was the only family he's ever known and he was justifiably mad at the Council for taking both away from him. And so by extend angry at everyone on the Ark and their rules.   It's been established very early on that Bellamy is a fierce protector, probably too much for his own good. He tried to justify his actions by saying he did it for Octavia when, as she pointed out, she never asked for any of it. He made rash decisions, was selfish and cared about protecting himself, but after the Culling it all quickly caught up to him. Then there was the whole Charlotte thing and torturing Lincoln, which also clearly took a toll on him. He felt guilty for what he did, he was at a really low place, probably the lowest we've seen him at.   But he did realize he was acting like an asshole, cleaned up his act and started to care about all of the people at camp and their safety. He was clearly distraught during the season one finale and felt the duty to protect his friends, even if it endangered his life.   Talking about the aftermath of the Culling, I think people did sorta blame him for what happened (Raven definitely did and I think Octavia, too) but he actually blamed himself the most, which was, I think, even more important than people giving him shit.
Create a simple plane and add the texture or image to it. If you can't just drag the texture or image to the plane, make a material and drag the texture to that material and then that material to the plane.   Then, assuming the terrain is at 0,0,0, move the plane to 0,1,0. You won't be able to see the terrain while nothing has been raised, but as soon as you do, you'll have no problem (again, assuming you raise anything by more than 1 unit, which is very likely).
First of all, this was not the first of these sorts of conversations, and often I go into the social/legal/cultural/philosophical/rhetorical etc. aspect. However, he got pretty sensitive about this last night, and I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back. This was imo a fairly trivial issue (though a little emotionally raw, in the sense that rejection sucks) and his extremely hostile reaction was unexpected.   I was talking to this girl on a chat forum (not a dating site), she complimented my answers and seemed excited to talk to me when I responded. Lots of happy emojis, was asking about what degree I did, where's the favourite place I've visited and shit.   I said Berlin (went on a school trip years ago, didn't say that part obviously :p) but as it was late last night I fucked up and just started chatting shit. I ended up naming Sachsenhausen concentration camp along with the Wall, Checkpoint Charlie etc., when I should have said Alexanderplatz Tower, River Spree, sauerkraut, lighthearted things. I said something like these places were 'an awe-inspiring experience'  which might sound vaguely Nazi sympathetic to some people. Also I spelled it wrong. I cannot believe I dun goofed that badly. I was a bit nervous given she was hot, but I'm not usually that clumsy.   I asked her where's her favourite place to travel and she had yet to get back. She had been online since to post a couple of short answers, nothing much. I didn't know whether she has lost interest, it's only been less than 24 hours since I sent it and she could be busy.   I've got a bit invested since it's the first girl to message me first in a while, and this kicked off my anxiety.   Anyway, last night shortly before bed as we were eating dinner, I brought up that the woman I was talking hadn't responded and I was a bit upset.  I was trying to figure out why since I have a tendency to ruminate and try to 'control' outcomes. I said I had thought of possibilities: She was busy, she hadn't got home yet, I said something wrong (mainly bringing up a concentration camp as a 'fun' topic, wtf was I thinking ugh) and so on.   He felt he didn't know why she hadn't responded, I was probably over thinking, should let it go it's not worth fretting about. Perhaps he was tired as he said he wanted to go to bed tbf, it was half 11 when we had this argument.   Eventually I let slip that I felt it was rude that she ended conversation halfway (without explanation or a goodbye of sorts for closure) and this was my confusion, why I 'expected' a response (I didn't but this was why I was holding on)   I said flippantly, off-hand as one of the last possible reasons I had considered, that part of me wonders whether she got away with it (asking the question because she is a woman, men being harassing double standard etc.)   even though I know this is how dating works and particularly online messaging, it still pissed me off.   I said that if I had asked a question, someone had responded and I just ended the conversation without response, I'd be treated as rude. I told him about my experience of guys who do this to girls being called assholes leading her on, treating her badly, viewing her as interchangeable and that she 'deserves better.' I said I'd read numerous links of such an outcome and seen this happen a few times IRL.   He just blew up at me. He got very defensive and hostile,  saying that's not his experience , saying he thinks I have 'an agenda', that I must think women are evil and view men as inferior and I never say positive things about women or a 'balanced' view of the world. He even used the term 'females' when I was just saying men and women, to make me sound more hostile than I was. He also said that if I want to spend my whole night fretting over some stranger then "be my guest", but he doesn't have the luxury of time nor the inclination to do so.   I don't understand why I am getting such an unsavoury response. I did not say anything like "that bitch rejected me, how dare she." We are in very early stages of messaging each other, and she may just be being friendly.  I hope I can make a casual remark about how I'm frustrated that there isn't always 'closure', as in letting someone down gently "been nice talking to you, good luck with everything" (a bit like ghosting really pisses me off, except this is way less of an emotional investment.) I am not expecting a relationship or even a friendship, just hoping for a polite "thank you, goodnight" if they're done with the conversation. I get annoyed about the way that systems have different rules depending on which way the exchange goes (a pet peeve as an aspie.) I don't know how this was translated as hating women and only saying negative things about them.   He made out that I was ignoring women's POV even though I have wrote literally essays, a dissertation, numerous studies, articles and philosophers relating to feminist theory  from the feminist perspective , and discussed this online for well over a year. I have to counsel a bunch of young people informally on their own issues empathising with each other; they come to me for help re: relationships. I have spent time interacting in both feminist and anti-feminist communities. This exchange had very little to do with feminist/MRA issues but for some reason was lumped in with them. I think the last thing I brought up to him was that I was going to start watching Sargon of Akkad because I heard he was cool and he [sic] 'debunks media propaganda and misleading statistics.'   When I asked him if he thought I was a misogynist, he backed down, denied that's what he meant and just started repeating "I want to go to bed." I eventually let it go when he started yelling at me.   We have since made up but I am wondering whether he is fed up of this shit. I did not realise he really thought I was a rapist in the making based off my conversations with him.   P.S. My parents are divorced, when I asked years ago what happened my mom told me she "just didn't love your father anymore." My sister felt he was a pushover and cringeworthy at the time. He concluded in counselling that he was a bad father who didn't spend enough time with his kids--even though he was obliged to work so much because Mom couldn't for years, and in the last few years she didn't really want to bs seen in public with him. However Dad has been in a happy relationship with his current girlfriend for over  years now. It's possible that he is personalising my complaints about 'feminism' and 'the gender wars' as being attacks against  his girlfriend , or my sister, or my niece…it is not like I am not friends with women.   Anyway, I am confused what the best thing to do is re: Dad, or even if I need to reconsider my opinions.
I don't really know if this is just something that I do, or something that's common, but often I find that my voice significantly changes when I talk to people I don't really know. When I talk to family, I generally speak at quite a low pitch (for a girl, at least), but when I speak to people I don't really know (especially people I think highly of) I change my voice to be quite high-pitched and clearer. As I grow more comfortable with people, I use a deeper voice with them.   As a bit of a challenge (and just so I wouldn't have to expend so much energy speaking in an unnaturally high-pitched voice), I decided to try and speak as close as I could to my normal voice with strangers and acquaintances. In short, it's really helped.   I did find it a massive challenge at first, but the fact that our voice is something we have such immediate control over I think helped me to feel more in control in general. Speaking in a more natural voice, I found that my behaviour was altogether closer to how it is with family. Plus, I felt more relaxed and absolutely delighted that I'd managed to accomplish something.   I know that this might not work for everyone. Personally, I'm very self-conscious in regards to my voice, so speaking in a more natural voice (the one I hate) with strangers was both a huge challenge and a huge accomplishment. I'm no where near being able to do it consistently, but just brief moments of success are making me happy. I'd really recommend trying it - just in case it does help you even a little bit.
First of all, pvp and pve parry is MASSIVELY different.   For PvE parrying you basically want to parry as their strike is moving towards you, your parry animation has a small window where if the hit connects with you it will perform the parry. Either watch their hand or their weapon, as it's approaching you you want to start the parry.   Of course all enemies will be different but once you learn a few it starts to get easier to learn new attack patterns but it can still be a challenge when facing new enemies.
I definitely see both sides of the coin here--your boyfriend hasn't seen you for two weeks (or has it just been two weeks since you went home? I'm a little unclear on this), and when you finally get back, you don't want to spend any time with him. I can see why that would hurt him.   Likewise, you want to just have some alone time to unwind and "get back to zero," as it were. That has nothing to do with him; it just is what it is.   I think his feelings are justified, but he seems to have gone overboard. I don't know what your solution is, other than to talk about it once emotions have had a chance to cool down. But to answer the question in your
This is probably the first "my book is published" announcement I haven't downvoted. Thanks for not saying "give me good reviews" (ha ha ha, sure,  some  people might do that without reading it, but being happy about getting something published and wanting to tell people about it seems legit to me). Class.
I visited folks in the US during London 2012, in the middle of the Games. Prime-time coverage on NBC was terrible. So many commercials. Too much fluff pieces. There was a weird emphasis on the commentators, whereas CBC tends to be more low-key and let the sport unfold. Not enough time to cover each event. They only showed US performances, and glimpses of other countries, so I had no idea how US athletes actually compared to others. It looks like they're gearing up for the same this year.
r/gamedeals has 73000 subscribers and generates only one page of posts a day, and is for a much more popular hobby that is prone to sales in the first place. I don't see how an /r/boardgamedeals, would ever get enough volume to be worth checking regularly, and so I would browse it as /r/boardgames+boardgamedeals which would then defeat the point. But that's just my opinion.
So, I've been a larker for a while, but it's time to post, since I'm not really sure where to go from here. This is day 26 of my leaving. Before that, I smoked pretty much all day, every day during summer, and have been a daily toker for almost a year before this. I'm just not really sure what direction this is going in, so. Why did I stop? My dealer from home had a baby, and my dealer at Uni has gone to Russia, so I was out of contacts. It was costing me a fair amount of money and I did feel like I would get more done in my final year at uni if I wasn't toking every day. So I vowed that I would stop.   Now, I wasn't sure if this should be a permanent abstinence or a period of abstinence before being able to smoke in a controlled way. So, I guess that's what I'm asking - has anyone else been able to step it down after a period of abstinence? If I do decide to start smoking again (then I'll be tracking it religiously), what limits should I set myself? Note that if I do break these I will then continue to be abstinent permanently. I didn't know whether this would be temporary or permanent - so I decided at 6 weeks I would re-evaluate. I'm just looking for some guidance.   I've given up drinking [48 days] (since that was far more of a problem), and smoking [16 days] (so if I were to smoke trees I'd buy some tobacco free, nicotine free smoking mix).
You get an answer a lot faster if you called them.  They GRCA is generally pretty helpful.   I can say they'll tell you it isn't legal.  In Ontario you can legally camp for free on 'crown land' which is undeveloped land owned by the province.  Most crown land in Ontario is north of Barrie.  There are some caveats--you can't camp longer than 21 days, you have to be an Ontario resident, don't leave a mess.  Plus some other rules I can't remember.  Conservation Areas are their own entity--their land is not considered Crown Land, and they don't allow random camping.  They have organized campgrounds, some of which are really decent (Rockwood and Elora are nice GRCA campgrounds).  The primary mandate of Conservation Areas is to protect water and prevent flooding--the land they hold is usually floodplain set aside for when the rivers rise.   That said will you get caught?  Couldn't say.  Probably not.  What will happen?  Depends on who catches you.  Grand River is one of the biggest watersheds in Southern Ontario.   I'd be more worried about random dogs and drunken teenagers than I would about the police.  They'll probably just think your a homeless person and move you along. Camping on an island in the river is totally fine though.  Quirk of the law.  No one owns those.   Assuming of course the land is actually the GRCA's and not private property, which most of the river is.
So  heres   ill be referencing that last picture a lot. chicago longboarders might be interested.   to set the scene, its 8:30 and i dont have class till 10:10. i have my board with me and im tired of sitting around with it. time to explore.   fast forward to me getting there and BAM. the first area I hit is in the lower left corner of that map, but its cut out. its right next to the bean. the granite on the ground feels soooooooooo good. its like gliding on a cloud. I think I spent 5 minutes carving around.   next I took off down michigan, passed the bean to the upper left corner of the map. see that curved wall? thats a list of people who donated or founded the park or something. the right end of that, go up the stairs. theres a long curved wheelchair ramp behind that wall. at 8:45 in the morning aint no one around but security (who told me I cant skate there). I went down that ramp maybe three times going faster each time. nothing crazy, but really fun.   next I moved on to the bean. I didnt skate there because security. [here I am though]( I swear I have a head! I was wearing a black hat.   now heres the exciting part of all this. im walking up hill on the street you see at the top of the map going to the right. once i got to the top i skated further to the park just out of the picture. see the square of trees in the upper left of the park? just past that is a sloped section of side walk the width of 2 car lanes. the same thing albeit less angled is on the other side of the park. [Picture]( I swear it looks more sloped in person.   so refer to the MFW from earlier when I see that mini hill. I dont care if its concrete and full of holes and cracks IM GOING DOWN! and so I did. 3 times.   let me set this for you. you HAVE to stay on the left half until the last few feet in order to not get a wheel stuck in a hole. at the end of the hill you move to the right half. the ground levels out and you make a 45 degree turn and coast.   on the third run a park's van was parked on the inside of that 45 degree turn. I knew that on the other side of it were 2 workers, who i might plow through. in order to safely go down I have to move to the right half of the path and carve right really hard to make the turn after I pass the van.   goddammit I should have waited for the ban to leave but it was so fun at the same time.   I go down and I pushed one or two times to many, causing me to hit 15 REALLY fast. I get a little speed wobbles but two mellow carves got that in check. just kidding, they gave me MASSIVE wobbles for the last half of the hill. somehow I keept going into the turn nearly hitting the van.   do you know how fucking scary it is to be 50 degrees from the ground and have your board oscillating towards and away from you while youre trying not to fly into the grass or hit people you cant see?   well im almost made the turn but my left wheels went in the grass for just a moment. I didnt lose any speed but immediately said "fuck this" out loud and bailed. if I didnt bail I probably would have slowed, regained control and coasted away like a boss. Instead my board flew into the back of my pushing foot's ankle. I hardly felt it even though it hit me really hard enough to make it bleed a little bit.   I turned around to get my board and saw the 2 workers. one was looking at me rather neutrally and the other was giving me a nod of approval. I said "well there goes my ankle". the neutral one said "hey, at least it wasnt your nose" and I skated off.   now did you notice how the street with the bridge is sloped? yeah. I fucking went down that while the side walk was crowded as hell, and i couldnt go in the street. I had to bail 3 times (I couldnt control my speed and people were in front of me). now, I get to the last third and YES its all clear. so i go down and allow myself to get speed. thats when I realized im headed for an intersection and im a fucking idiot. so I carve back into some section of the park by the top of the ramp I mentioned earlier, and wouldnt you know it. the same security dude that said I cant skate there happened to be sitting right there. he starts waving his arms and saying "you cant do that here!". once I came to a stop I explained that I was trying to lose speed/ not hit a crowd of people. he was cool about it and didnt recognize me from earlier or didnt care.   then I headed back to campus to wash of my ankle and chill.
This post was partially inspired by a Facebook friend's status detailing how she turned old wine boxes into Geoboards.  REmember those boards with pins on them and you put like rubberbands on them and shit?  I didn't either, mostly because I had reading and math with the 2nd graders down the hall.  Oh, you too are an alcoholic that likes stroking your ego.  Let's talk about that "potential" we had, eh?   In any case, I have saved up 12 or so spacebags in the span of maybe 3 months--so yeah, if I want to be a great spacebag engineer I certainly can pick up the pace.  Practice makes perfect, just don't be fooled by [the imitators](  And just like any engineering design it goes back to basic principles--can you find he moment of inertia of a Franzia box about its strong axis?  I-beams are the most commonly used for reasons, ya know.  May as well understand the true power of the spacebag.  Tape and other reinforcements help too.   ENGINEERING JIZZ SESSION ASIDE: what do  you  think a ton of old wine boxes could become? I have  extended my desk   I could not top Fort Spacebag, nor would I want to come close either inentionally or nonintentionally.  Some others mentioned tables, or a wine rack, or for the most yoloest of our community--a boat was suggested.  OK maybe demanded.  But hey, S.S. Spacebag has a ring to it.   (
As someone who has worked in technical support,   it's helpful to have that red light in order to avoid situations like:   "Hello! my dvd isn't working!"   "Well let's see, what do you see on the DVD screen?"   "I don't know!"  Customer angry   "Is the red light on the left side on?"   "No it's not.."   (after checking if they're on the right channel)   "Hmm.. Let's try turning the DVD off then, do you have the remote? ... Try clicking on the ON/OFF button in the upper right corner, the red light should now turn on"   "I tried and it doesn't! Why don't you send a technician already?!"   "Ok, let's just try pulling the power cable out, and then waiting for a 10 seconds to put it back in"   (2 seconds after you say that)   "Oh! I fixed it!"   "How?"   "I just fixed it thanks a lot!" (as he sees that the power cable was pulled out)
I'd normally agree, but to be honest there's a difference between disagreement, and genuinely believing that someone's who's politics lie to the left/right of yours is the same as the man responsible for the mechanized, industrial slaughter of millions of innocent people. It's not a good confession, but OP has a point.
My story involves the doctor being embarrassed, not myself:   I had gone to an appointment for a general check-up, and my regular doctor asked if it was alright to bring in a resident physician to ask me some questions, which I said was fine. My doctor leaves and brings in a young Indian man who introduces himself cheerfully. He begins to ask me some questions - "How is your sleep? How about your eating habits?" Suddenly his cell phone goes off in his pocket. A pop beat that I didn't recognize. Then I hear the lyrics - "I jizz in my pants!" He's fumbling like crazy trying to get the phone to shut off as the song is playing and finally pulls it out of his pocket, says "Ummm, sorry about that" as he puts his phone on silent and glances back to the attending physician, who seems to have no idea what just happened. I kept myself from laughing out loud, but it was pretty tough.
So much salt. My friend and I did 15 10+1 scouts and managed to get one UR each of our least favorite idols. Each account got one UR from the scouts...   Now you might think we would feel really lucky. But it turns that my friend drew the UR copy that he already had, of his least favorite Idol. So now it's idolized. All he wanted was a UR that WASN"T that character. I drew a UR of my least favorite idol as well... and  my goal was goal was to go for the Maki @.@"
Art teacher in high school was batcrap crazy. One time in class, while me and my friends were at a table just doing our art stuff, he suddenly pops up between me and my friend wearing a plastic rat nose. He looks at both of us and then goes, "Where's the cheese?!" We couldn't say a word, it was just too freakin' crazy. He then stands up and walks back to us desk still asking, "Where's the cheese?!"   Another day the same teacher offered my friends and I some gum at the beginning of class. We accepted because hey, free gum. As he's handing us the pieces though a few students walk through the hallway doors (the art rooms were connected by a larger hallway that had it's own door) and he flips out and tries to dart away but trips over a chair and falls over. "OMG are you okay?!" He just jumps up and brushes himself off like nothing happened and just went back to his desk. The kids in the hallway just walked by with the greatest "WTF" looks on their faces.   While the older lady art teacher was crazy but just in a funny, escentric way, the old guy art teacher had a way of being reeeeeeaally crazy awkward instead of endearing.
The biggest issue is that depending on what type of drive train your car has your response should change.  For instance, if I'm driving a rear wheel drive muscle car and I start to slide, I act differently than if I'm driving an all wheel drive rally car or a 4 wheel drive truck.  They do mimic this in new driving games, but not well.  When was the last time you were playing GTA or need for speed and hitting the gas in a banked turn on a front wheel drive car caused massive under steer?   If you take a rear wheel drive car out on snowy icy roads you'll get it right away.  There is no weight over the rear axle so hitting the gas won't do anything except make the tires spin more.  Take a Subaru into that same scenario and it's a completely different beast.  In an AWD car when you loose traction, the car will shunt power to only the tires that have traction.  Start to slide, hit the gas and you'll recover if it's possible.   Now, a note on 4WD VS AWD:  technically in "true 4WD" or 4low, the differentials will lock and even power will be distributed to all tires evenly.  That means equal power to all 4 wheels.  You can see how this would be an advantage in some situations but a disadvantage in others.  If I'm trying to pull a horse trailer out of the mud I want a really low gear and even power distribution to all my traction surfaces.  If, however I'm trying to make a tight turn on blacktop, even power to all wheels is a bad thing.  My inner wheels want to go slower than my outside set.  This will make the truck hop and grind as it turns.  This is why all 4WD's primarily drive in rear wheel and only switch when the driver locks the differential.   In most of the stories on this thread, what most people describe is the standard RWD / dry track response.
So there I was, I had just finished a game of control.  I saw the glorious "SwagOutTheWazoo" has received a legendary engram.  I was excited but readied myself for the almost inevitable disappointment.  I arrived at the tower and ran to the Cryptarch.  I couldn't believe what I saw.  It was an exotic helmet! It was for my class, warlock, too!   So yes, all of the exotics for the wrong class and miscellaneous rare items have not been for naught.  I have received the reward.
I'd second this idea. Having repaired a good amount of 360's I can say the metal inner casing doesn't just simply pop apart there are a  lot of long torx screws holding the inner casing together  but about half of them do. Yet you can see the metal casing in the original image isn't damaged.   I'm guessing he'd already taken it apart to attempt a fix, realized he couldn't, and had it sitting aside. When he saw the Robot Devil post he likely saw an opportunity to make the best of it.
OMG!!, I laughed so hard. like-craugh hard.   I recently dated this guy, while on the day we met (group setting) he and a gf of mine agreed, farting is a hard line.. no times is it EVER acceptable. Not one month in, not ten yrs. I was dismayed.  Surprisingly we made it past that day, but the farting quote stuck with me.. I couldnt muster a single fluff around this guy,  sometimes to the point of pain. One day, we were together sun up to sun down. I needed to fart many a times but just ignored my needs and went about the day..... Laying in bed that night I was like man.. I hope that I make it through the night..    >>FF>> Next morning he casually mentions... Man, you sleep so hard! You were breathing hard, and snoring, and farting all night!! I was embaressed to say the least, but we ate fast food that day and I'm battling some serious allergens. Shit happens..    Coincidentally, last time we ever spent the night together.. Guess he was serrrrrious bout that...
Well this thread expllded. The only reason I made it was cos I hadn't slept properly last night   I see 'no ones owes you anything' and 'entitlement' from women all the time. It's pretty much the norm for women to take men's insecurities and pound them into submission these days while mocking you on r/niceguys, r/relationships, r/creepypms or whatever else, while calling a man a misogynist or abusive for saying anything which doesn't put their pussy on a pedestal or subscribe to WomenAreWonderfulEffect (Assuming of course that he's unattractive; attractive men can get away with a fair amount of shit, and women are less likely to abuse these men because they are not genetic waste in their eyes)   Given my vulnerabilities, I have been thinking; nobody really owes a shit when they're with me to look after me in any way do they? I'm not actually entitled to receive any form of affection, validation, respect, loyalty or even basic physical security from anyone, not even a partner.   Can women use 'he's an Entitled Bigot' as a defence to get through the Duluth Model if they commit DV on a man? Curious
SURVEY LINK FOR THOSE IMPATIENT   Hey there Reddit.   My name is Colin Popell.   I’d like to share with you the first public statement about my new company, Noo-Mix LLC. I took a look at the current nootropic market, and it leaves much to be desired.   A lot of the supplement market lacks a scientific bearing, and unfortunately this is true for a lot of nootropic suppliers as well. This is a problem, because I’m a firm believer that the nootropics market is one that should be supported and helped to grow.   So I decided to do my part to change it. Noo-Mix LLC will be a science based, as transparent as possible, research friendly company built with the help of, and to the benefit of, the communities it interacts with. We won’t sell you any supplements we can’t find data that supports, we’ll conduct tests and gather data as much as possible, and we’ll pull products we find to either have adverse effects or no effect.   How are we going to do this?  I am trying to build the most comprehensive data set of the effect of various stacks, demographics, interactions, backgrounds, and any other variables that might affect interactions with nootropics.   We’re also pretty sure we’re going to offer a few features no other company yet offers, but we’ll keep that on the down-low for now.   Where do we want to go with this?  Well, fairly obviously I’d like the company to grow and make money. I’d also like to spread nootropics more into the mainstream on college campuses (less reliance on amphetamines by people who don’t understand them), clear up misconceptions of nootropics, and gather the largest database of nootropic interactions in the world.   I’m a transhumanist too, and I’d like to use this as a platform to help support the transhumanist community. All of my investors are going into this with the understanding that a portion of our profits may be reinvested into other emerging technologies, using this company as a launch platform. I don’t want to go into details here, but you can bet that money will be going into interesting projects in both drug and technological research.   How can you help us?  Pretty easy, actually. As ambitious as my goals might be, I’m only starting out with a finite amount of cash. So linked at the top and bottom of this page is a survey on your nootropic habits. Feel free to fill it out in as much detail or as little detail as you want (though more is obviously preferable to me), but please fill it out. The more people who fill it out, the better data we’ll get, and the better we can optimize our initial expenses. Plus it gives us market data so that we can get more money from investors to expand faster, and to serve our customers better.   Sorry,
I've decided an Outback is the most practical for me out of all the vehicles I've researched. I'm 16 and this would be my first car. I also assume insurance will be decent since it's a station wagon. I live in Michigan. I'm new to Subarus but I've always like them. I just need help deciding on which engine to get in the OBW. Any help is greatly appreciated.   I was going to go with the 4 cylinder, however after researching I read about head gasket issues. I also read that it's under powered and isn't as smooth as the 6 cylinder and the fuel economy isn't much different. I intend on doing quite a bit of highway driving, but I'll also be doing a lot of city.   I like the wider range of options that come with the 6, such as the moon roofs and VDC. I read that premium fuel is recommended. Is medium-grade fine or is it detrimental to the engine? Is one engine known to be more reliable than the other?   Also when purchasing an OBW is there certain things I should check for when looking at it? Basically any common problems that can be seen without tearing into it?
It's not always that easy.   Like I said, as a teen I moved around a lot. Like every six to eight months. Not military, my mom was bipolar and my father was working in Riyadh at the time. I had a younger brother, and because of my mother's work and lifestyle habits I was often home to watch ny brother. This meant a lot of the socializing I did was through school.   My first day I was terrified. I tried initiating with people. Some would make awkward teen small talk before finding something else, others would flat out ignore me, some would make fun of me. The better conversations I had were with teachers. At lunch time there was a dining commons and an area outside. Within the first five minutes, the dining common fills up; if you don't make it, you sit outside. It took me fifteen minutes to find the place, so I ate outside. Found a group my age sitting outside; I as an awkward teen sat within the circle, hoping to just assimilate into the conversation. Like in movies, the group got up and walked inside. I sat alone, with my roast beef sandwich and iced tea, tears in my eyes. I went to my next class fifteen minutes early.   The next few weeks were much of the same. I don't know why I couldn't click with anyone, I just couldn't. The more I tried, the more I was rejected or ignored, the less self confidence I had... I learned to bring books for lunch. Then I brought headphones. The more i isolated myself, the more of a weirdo I looked like. I had terrible self esteem as it was, but the social isolation quickly grew to resentment. You don't want to be my friend? Fine, I didn't need friends anyway! (What a Shitty frame of mind)   To compound matters, I lived on a poor side of town and seemed to make myself more of an outcast. I gave myself a Mohawk, became vegan, socialist, aggressive asshole. The walks home became miserable. I got into a lot of fist fights on that walk home. By the time I got my license, any free time I had was spent two and a half hours north in my hometown with my old friends.   People avoided me and I avoided people. One time we had an anti bully seminar at the high school. The next day at lunch time, I was approached by three pretty girls who introduced themselves and seemed genuinely interested in conversation. I was shaking I was so excited! That ten minutes was incredible, and I went home with my head held high. The next day I sought them out and sat with them, they made polite conversation but kept most of the talking between themselves. Maybe I misread the situation, because to me it felt like they felt they had approached me because of the message of the seminar and to make themselves better people. My stomach sank and I ended up just leaving,, crying on my way home. I got detention the next day for skipping class.   Forward to the end of my sophomore year. Teachers loved me,, whenever they saw me they would see me reading and would start conversations about books and politics. My history teacher caught on that I didn't have friends; I was embarrassed about it so I never brought it up with a teacher, but he put two and two together. He noticed some of my shirts and my general style: after class, he literally dragged me to find a junior that was in a punk rock band and introduce me. The junior invited me to his next show, and that's how I got into going to punk rock shows. That was a great summer.   My junior year people started to notice and recognize me. By that time I wasnt really used to it, and at this point it was probably my own Damn fault. I chose to eat alone, because I assumed nobody likes me. The more I got outside and around people, the better I got at socializing, and the better I started to get at making friends. By the end of my junior year, I began hanging out with people. By senior year, I stopped bringing books to lunch.   It was miserable and it was very real. But in that time, I became who I was because I wanted to. I wasn't trying to impress anyone, and what I believed in was deep and meaningful to me. I hated those years, but they completely shaped who I am today, and I can honestly say I like myself now.
IBM back when they failed their goals and dropped like $10/share maybe 7 months ago.  I figured as such a large company with substantial history they could just shrug it off. They did, it just took a lot longer than I was hoping.
So I've got [this stripped Mosin receiver]( that I literally spent hours surrounding with glory just to make the concept of chambering it in something other than 54r a bit more palpable. Before the enchantment cast upon you by the treasures from the Motherland dissipates, and you brand me a heretic, what ideas do you have for turning this fine machine into a new weapon?   This is the only gun I have laying around that is incapable of shooting anything, and that doesn't sit well with me. As you can see, I've got plenty of means to dispose of my 54r ammunition, so I'd like to feed this guy something different. I realize I'll have to research what kind of pressures this action will tolerate before I settle on a cartridge, but I've never done a project like this before and would like to get some of your guy's ideas.   So: got an idea you've wanted to try but never seen done? Seen something done that worked well? Anything I should be cautious of? The only round I've thought of so far is .444 marlin because it's rimmed and the back of it is close in size to 54r, but I bet there are other interesting things that might work well. What do you think?
Hey, this is my first post, so feel free to comment on what I should do to make it better.   I tend to go back an forth between being a straight-out atheist to being desperate for faith in a religion. So when a couple Mormon missionaries knocked on my door, I gladly listened to them. They had me attend church, meet with other Mormons, etc. and we had plenty of in-depth debates. In the end, after not being able to convince me that any of the scripture had any scientific basis, and after telling them that "faith" is not the answer to give me if they want to convert me, they accepted I would never convert.   However, I'm glad I went through with everything. I learned a lot, strengthened my views/debating skills, and best of all, made some of the best friends I've ever had. We still hang out regularly, despite our vastly differing views. I'd really like to see other people form friendships like this, even if they have completely different beliefs.
This is a bigger undertaking than you might realize.  Wind tunnel design is a complex science and in order to really do it right (and get any kind of meaningful results) you need to spend some time learning about aerodynamics at an undergraduate level.  Good reading might include Race car aerodynamics:Designing for speed by Joseph Katz and Fundamentals of Aerodynamics by John Anderson.  The fundamentals of aero. book is a book used extensively at the undergraduate level and as a general reference book in the industry and is calculus heavy, but it might be useful for some equations and explanations...always looks good in the bibliography.   For what you're hoping to accomplish (proving that an F1 car produces ~2900 lb of downforce at certain speed)  I would say forego the exact model and experiment with simple 2D wing cross sections.  Use some kind of a force meter to determine what a certain area of wing is capable of at certain flow conditions and extrapolate to something representative of a F1 car in your report (this will be a fairly long and drawn out extrapolation that will fill out the report quite nicely, you should get a fairly chunky report when done, which in HS is pretty much a guaranteed "A")   A couple things on wind tunnel design (I'm an aerospace engineer), look into reynolds numbers and understand how they scale with airspeed and size of the model.  Not sure if you know this, but the smaller you go, the faster the flow has to be to have an appropriate number.  The faster the flow, the more difficult it is to keep it laminar.  Wall interference with the model is also important, you don't want to inadvertently create an unwanted ground effect by having the test section too close to the wing, causing compression between the wall and wing.   I'll bet if you run a cross section of each wing element and extrapolate those to the total wing area on the car, you'll see that you've got a crap ton of downforce.  Maybe 1500 lb?  At that number, for what you're doing, you could probably pretty easily conclude that the floor is contributing enough force to support the car (look for some sources and numbers, there's people out there who might have some general numbers for open wheel car floor aero forces)   Quick trick in the wind tunnel design, easy way to make flow laminar at low speeds (incompressible assumption range) is to not care too much about the compression and diffuser stages, but rather have a super long length of pipe the same cross section as your test section in front of the actual test section.  The flow that might have detached in the change from fan x-section to test section x-section will generally reattach within 10 lengths of the diameter of the x-section.  Don't get too carried away with abrupt transitions though, try to stay under 17 degrees (handwavy number we use for rough test ducts) on the converging angle.  I'd presonally vent to atmosphere with a total loss system and include some sort of throat in front of the fan
Found out a cute friend of a friend had a crush on me for a year or two.  I was flattered and entertained the idea, but my best bud liked her a lot, so  I stopped talking to her.   Best bud went for it, asked her out, got rejected.   We don't hang out with her and that crowd anymore.
So I'm planning my wedding and have come upon a problem I didn't expect would be a issue. Cute wedding FLATS are almost impossible to find! (at ones that aren't like over $200! Seriously someone needs to corner this market) So can one of you wonderful fellow tall ladies please direct me towards a link where I can get some cute bridal shoes that don't make me a foot taller than my groom and won't cost a fortune?
Foreword: I'm pretty tech savvy. I build and repair PC's regularly at a local business. This has me stumped. System specs:   Windows 7 64bit Ultimate SP1   AMD Phenom X4 965BE CPU   Adata 2x 8gb DDR3 RAM (1333)   ASrock 960GM Motherboard   Asus Geforce 650ti OC Edition 1gb vidya card   Kingston SSD v300 240gb   (unknown brand) HDD 7200rpm 300gb   Seagate 1tb usb3.0 external flash drive   OS boots from the SSD. HDD is just for storage, as is the external.   So, ever since installing the SSD I would rarely (maybe once in every 50 times) bluescreen. Because it was so infrequent, I ignored it. So today, at 1pm, I boot up the PC and it doesn't start. It hangs on a black screen. So I held the power button to turn it off, and upon reboot got the 'Start in Safe Mode, Start Normally' page. Starting normally, it crashed and rebooted.   It booted normally, and so I decided to start up the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool. It restarts and runs, going through the 'Standard' scan. Afterward, shit hits the fan. Now it crashes on %99 of startups, safemode, safemode with networking, command prompt etc.   So I initially tried resetting BIOS options to default. Doesn't help. I put my SSD back as the initial boot. I ran a rootkit scan using TDSSkiller, and it found a 'suspicious file':   C:\Windows\system32\nvvsvc.exe   Which it then quarantined. I don't know if that's relevant. I am not sure what the problem is... RAM maybe?   UPDATE 340pm : did 10passes with memtest and upon exiting the screen stayed black for 10+ min, HDD light on constantly. Didn't reboot itself, so I did manually. As you can see, it's working fine atm. How do I see the results from memtest?
Thanks for all your comments on the [original post](   So I just met with the assistant provost of the department that oversees the disability office. I explained what had happened last week as well as my previous great experience with the office and explained I was concerned I wasn't being offered all the accommodations I should, although I told him I had no idea if there were even any additional accommodations that would benefit me, because my case worker flat out said she did not believe my symptoms were consistent with ADHD and advised me to seek another diagnosis.   The accommodations I received were the typical for students with  typical  ADHD, although, I will remind you I am very newly diagnosed and have not found ways to succeed with ADHD yet. He was concerned that she did question the diagnosis but he did try to explain that as a clashing of personalities. His responses and empathy appeared very rehearsed and he tried really hard to convince me of the hard work the disability office does, when I never questioned that. Ultimately he wanted me to tell him what he should do about my case  worker not believing me.   At this point we decided if I have issues I should go to a different case worker in the office but I told him, at this point, if I have issues with a faculty member I wouldn't feel like the disability office would back me up.
Yes. Rapier has two states, original and free. Original rapier is just like a regular item, it's muted to everyone except for the owner, and can be picked up, dropped, and transferred freely among teammates. It's muted to everyone except the owner and drops onto the ground on death. However, once an enemy hero picks up the rapier, it becomes Free rapier. Free rapier cannot be dropped manually or transferred to another player, and gives the person holding it the damage bonus no matter if they're the original owner or not.
I will rant a little but it is needed to understand the story fully  My name is Darien. All my life I have seen happy people with girlfriends/boyfriends. Since 5th grade I was bullied verbally. Because of my lips. I was called fish lips, and big lips a lot. The really messed up thing about that is bullying would stop when football season was underway. I thank God for my size. Because if it weren't for my size I would have been bullied physically. Whenever we would play football everybody would go to the games. I played Defensive end and I got like 3 sacks a game. Im good needless to say.  My junior year Highlights  then we had middle school (7th to 8th grade), and finally we have high school (9th to 12th grade). When I got to high school <9th grade> the bullying stopped, for the most part. I wasn't like all the other black kids at my highschool. What do I mean by that? I didn't wear Jordans, I didn't worry about getting weed to smoke, I didn't slap girls asses, I respected females, I was on the varsity debate team and I got homework done ASAP, I spoke in a grammatically correct manner and I didn't sag like a nigger. Instead I always got on the computer at school and played halo competitively. I almost went semi pro in halo reach. I have beaten other semi pros like Oblistika and shady my gamer tag is Polyfluorite hence the username. Polyfluorite is actually a chemical found in toothpaste, it was unique and I figured not many people knew what it is so I used it. I was a nerd, I admit it. Im proud of it. I'm  a 6'3 245 pound athletic nerd. We come in all shapes and sizes. My sophomore year a kid named Hakur Kaymore started to test me. Hakur in my opinion just wanted to mess with the chill quiet kid who wasn't like everyone else. Back then we had 3rd period athletics. After athletics I was walking back to my school alone listening to some good dub step and he punched me in the back of my head. I was going to fight back but then his 6 cousins surrounded me. I just kept walking. I met him in the bathroom 1v1 and he didnt want to fight me. After I pushed him into a stall. I wasn't going to stoop to his level if he didnt want to fight me. After that day, the bulling began again. Once I had 45 pound plates in both hands in the weight room and he pushed me on purpose, another time he called me out and made fun of my "swag" only he laughed but that still pissed me off, and the last time he messed with me was when athletics was over and we were heading in the locker room to take our pads off and he slapped my butt. I was beyond angry I was going to explode. I waited until we got into the locker room. I took my pads off and I called him out. The locker room spread into a octagon shape, everyone was silent. It wasn't much of a fight, I hit him like twice then he fell and I got on top. The coaches came in and coach Walker told asked me if he needed to call the school police or doesn't he. I was  FULL  of adrenaline and I said call the  "CALL THE FUCKING POLICE, I DONT GIVE A FUCK" . He called them and I ended up with a assault charge (which later got expunged because the judge liked me) and I got Alternative school placement. After that year was over I transferred to [Grace Preparatory Academy]( its a college prep school and with kids that have the same/similar goals I do, Like college. The work load is ridiculous but I only go to school here Monday, Wednesday, Friday. I met my Girlfriend here. She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. My first year at grace was my junior year. I played varsity football and Im kinda popular here. People are open minded here instead of close minded like public school. At least my Public school. My girlfriend and I started slow. I played baseball and she knew it. We were friends for about 4 weeks and I decided to ask her to homecoming. I got a baseball and wrote "Homecoming?" on it and she said "oh my God" and then said yes. It was great. We went on our first date on sept 15 but I asked he to be my girlfriend on Sept 22, a day before my birthday. It feels good to have gone from a bullied kid in to a football college prospect, a smarter than before Darien and a guy that has been dating Miss Fort Worth for 1 year, on Sept 15. I am a senior now and realizing all these things now make me so excited. What I remember most about this journey is when I was in public school, I asked my crush for 2 years to date me and she said no; I was in 9th grade. I came home and did homework then went outside. It was about 8 o clock. I sat on the curb of my house and asked why I had to go through all this. I had a moment when I just wondered why me? Why did I have to get bullied and why did I have to go through all this crap?.   What I left out   I should not have been accepted in to Grace Prep.  WHY?   I was an incoming junior I got in a fight and placed in Alternative school  *My grades werent good and I failed the entrance test.   Why did they accept me?   They had faith in me, and I am a great public speaker. That attribute helped me a lot in my entrance interview.   I was done with girls all together and I decided to just focus on school and then Terri (my girlfriend) reached out to me and started talking to me and thats how we met. She is miss Fort Worth Texas I would have never thought I would be dating a great person like her. By the way she has the  SAME  last name I do. Im convinced we will be together forever.   Now, my senior year we have become the school couple. Im a dj. [My soundcloud]( Whenever I dj and I see her with me the school always says kiss kiss kiss. We never do because the teachers but its good to have that kind of support from peers.  Thanks to all those who read my story I just thought I would post since today is tuesday I'm not at school and my homework is done. Sucks for public school HAHAHA  Cheers.   Grammar, Spelling
I'm [20 M] emotionally devistated.   I've been with my GF for 5 years now. 5 amazing, unbelievable years.   She was there for me when my father went into a coma for 6 months, and when my mother got breast cancer. She has been my rock for so unbelievably long.   We do everything together with our 1 1/2 year old daughter, who is the light of my life. She is my little bear and I'm so happy she's a part of my life. It's always meant a great deal to me to beat the stigma of teen parenthood, and giving my daughter the most love I can possibly give.   To begin, my GF has the worst self esteem I've ever seen. I adore her with complements and most of the time she calls me a liar. She's been on anti depressants for a while and is very, very impulsive and gererally bad to be around when she's off of them. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and (I thought) the most innocent. I'm a good looking guy, I mean I felt pretty secure before all of this, but now just feel worthless.   In hindsight, I should've seen this coming. I've been busy with work, and trying to secure a future with my family. I love to cook and want to take over the family restaurant. We do pretty well for ourselfs. My GF took a job about a year ago at our local retail store to help with the bills. I found out she had stopped taking her anti depressants about 3 months ago. I could tell, because we were constantly arguing and she was being kinda wild with her emotions. I begged her to get back on them. This past month she has been emotionally vacant, not wanting to do anything. I would go to kiss her and just get a peck. I would try to be romantic and just got shot down.   I figured she was just readjusting to her new meds and everything would be fine. I am really easy going and figured nothing was wrong. Even when she wouldn't watch shows with me, and she'd be huddled up back against the wall on her phone. I brushed it off.   Today I took her out to eat after work, we went shopping and generally had a good time. She still seemed distant (in hindsight) but I still tried to make the best of it.  Coming back home, my phone had died and I needed to talk to my mother, who was watching our child. She handed me her phone and I scrolled through her recent calls.   I saw a name I had never seen on her phone before. At this point, she's telling me that my mothers number wasn't in there and I should just go to her contacts. I was kinda taken aback and asked her who this guy was. She was breathing really heavy and asking for her phone back. I was in disbelief and thought she would explain at any second how I was being dumb and this wasn't anything.  She didn't.   Instead, she starts hyperventilating and screaming for her phone back.   I looked though her messages. They have been flirting since at least Sunday, talking about how they want to see each other, and how happy they make each other. Hell, she got mad at him for seeing his ex.   They talked about my daughter. How he thought she was so adorable and how he wished he could meet her. That cuts worse than anything.   The funny thing is how deep the lie really went. She had this whole lie based around her best friend being the one seeing this guy. And how she had to talk to her friend because the guy she was seeing had been with another girl. When in reality, it was her telling him she was upset that he had seen this other girl. The best friend told her what she was doing was wrong and that it would hurt me.   I'm feeling Useless. Unwanted. Betrayed.  Worthless.   She never once argued. She just told me how i was the love of her life and that this meant nothing to her. She called the guy and told him she was done, and that she wanted to be with me. He blew up her phone and kept asking if everything was okay and blah blah blah. I tried to keep a level head, but I told her like it was, and how it tore me apart.   I'm currently at my fathers watching movies trying to think.   I know I'm going to have a parenting plan set up in the morning.   But beyond that, I don't know.   I know they didn't have sex based on the texts. I know this guy is absolutely in love with her. I know that I want what's best for my daughter. I know that the good times with her have been the best in my life. I know that the bad times have tore me up in the past.   I love her. I want a family. But good god I want to run away screaming too.
Hi, I'm new to Hearthstone :D I came from HOTS because I like playing Jaina and Malfurion so I wanted to check this game out. I love playing the priest because of the heals and I have made a "pepper spray" deck (have a lot of taunt minions so that the opponent stays away from my face then quadruple the hp of a minion and have its atk equal to its hp then attack). I have no knowledge about Warcraft lore outside of the HOTS heroes (was kinda uncomfortable that Malf here doesn't heal). We're about to have Medivh enter the nexus so I checked him out in the Hearthstone shop but seem to notice the lack of priests in there so, any chance of having a new more masculine priest hero? I have no problems with our current twink priest... it's just that I want to sound like a threat when I finally do the climax of my cheese strat :c Also, [this image]( pops into my mind whenever I lose....
Run using Launcher from 3DM. When you change settings (graphics options) sometimes game haz to restart, and when it does it automatically tries to run game using different exe.
It was the beginning of February, 2002. I had turned 14 the November before.   I met him through a friend of mine on the internet. Already I'm realizing how creepy this sounds, just bare with me. His girlfriend (yes, I know) was 16. He - the dirty prick that he is - was 26.   We met up for the first time at the local cinema. When I saw him my first thought was that he looked so much older than 26 and to be honest, he probably was. He had a Vauxhall Vectra which I was stupidly impressed by. Walking to his car we must have looked like father/daughter I am not kidding you. He drove me to a local football club and we parked on the car park in broad daylight. He had me bring a skirt with me to change into in case I didn't want to get fully naked.   We were sat in his car, and all I can remember is him grabbing me by the lapels of my denim jacket to kiss me. He supposedly went down on me, I don't remember feeling anything. I don't remember him penetrating me. I don't remember doing anything to him in return but I can remember the way he smelt and the fact that Uncle Kracker's 'follow me' song was playing on the radio. It was over within minutes.   He then drove me back to the bus station where I met my friends and drove back to his girlfriend. We continued our little "affair" for a couple of months after that but really. My mum found out I was meeting perverts from the internet and put a kibosh on that little adventure of mine. I thought I was such an adult for doing it.   Sickens me to this day.   The only backlash I really got, was almost being raped by the next boyfriend I had. I told him I had had sex already. This caused him to one day when we were alone forcibly try to remove my jeans and "get it in without me noticing"....his actual words.   I am telling my children that I lost my virginity to my childhood sweetheart. Because he's still a huge part of my life and one of my very good friends. In fact, the day we finally had sex with each other (after three months of dating) both of us were so happy it turned out to be so wonderful we cried afterwards.
So my wife and I parted on friendly terms around 6 months ago, have agreed to all our division of assets, and she has moved back to her family in Europe.  However, being in Canada, we are not allowed to legally divorce until 12 months of separation have passed (there was no adultery or cruelty), so we are still legally married.  There is zero chance of reconciliation; we don't talk much other than about the legal considerations and neither of us are interested.  It was a youthful mistake.   Meanwhile, there is this nice young lady that recently started coming to a meetup I go to with some friends, and I've talked to her a few times and we really hit it off.  I am interested in asking her out on a date, but I've been hesitant to bring the topic up; some of my friends have told me I shouldn't date until I am officially legally divorced, and shouldn't even ask her what she thinks.   I'm not desperate for a relationship, but she's really nice, and even if not her, I may meet someone else before the next 6 months are up.  What should I do, Reddit?  Tell prospective dates I'm still legally married before asking them out, or just wait for the marriage to be legally well and truly over before trying anything?
Going to break the circlejerk here because I've seen this same mentality about how we're all screwed and we'll never move out of our parents basements posted all over reddit multiple times and I just don't agree with it. It is true that you can no longer have a good, high paying job right out of high school, or even expect one simply because you graduated from college. The economy is changing, becoming global and automized at every possible point. Take the auto industry for example, companies used to pay Americans a really good wage to assemble their cars for them because there were no other options. Now though, you have hundreds of millions of Indians, Chinese, etc, who will gladly do the work and do it for less. Or in the case of cashiers, or secretaries, or clerks, or whatever you have it, most of these jobs have been automized or will be in the future (not secretaries for high powered companies though) or have been outsourced to other countries where people will work for basically nothing because they have nothing. The key then to landing a good job and a successful carear in this economy is to set yourself up with skills that are not easily done by a machine or that cannot be outsourced. This means that sorry, liberal arts degrees just aren't going to cut it anymore. I mean, what the hell are you going to do with an english major anyway (and this is coming from one)   A perfect example of this is my friend who is a chemical engineer, with a semester of college left but who already has a job offer for 55,000 per year with a 5,000 dollar bonus. Or another friend of mine is really into the outdoors, worked hard in college networking etc. and now was a decent job at an outfitter doing what she loves. And in my case, I'm a dual major in neuroscience and english, and have no fears about landing either a good job or a spot in graduate school (which pays 25k per year).  And if you don't want to do any of that there are other options out there. Where I'm from (Charleston SC) you can get a job as a waiter, make 200 a night, and live comfortably off that money. Or go to Aspen Colorado where waiter's make even more than that. Not exactly glamorous jobs but they pay well and you can live off them. There are good jobs out there, you just need to be qualified for them (aka non liberal arts degree) and work hard to pursue them.
My internet has been acting very very odd recently (the school is going through a process to increase the speed, so its expected) . When I am hooked up wirelessly, it is pretty much impossible to watch youtube videos and play games. But when I am set up with wired connection, I can browse the internet with no issues at all. But when I play sc2, its still extremely laggy and I will be dropped within 2 minutes of the game.   How could my internet be fast on my browser but not during gameplay?   Speedtest.net shows my internet at: 3mbps download 50mbps upload
I get stopped by police too much   You could probably fix that by not breaking the law.   I understand there are bad cops out there but not  every single fucking pig  is out to make your day miserable. I rarely get stopped by police in a vehicle or on foot. My friend does but it's mainly because she neglects maintenance on her car and goes above the speed limit  all the time . She complains the same way you do about always getting stopped by them.   But like I said, there are bad cops who get off by ruining your day but they are the minority.
I think that people are really really bad at internet logic.  All it takes is a little bit of speculation: what is the worst thing that could happen here, and what are the chances that this will happen?  This simple two-part question is very powerful, as I will demonstrate with two examples:     Someone just offered you 150% the value of your courier, in cash, right now, and they insist on you going first because reasons.       What is the worst thing that can happen?  ANSWER: they take your courier  What is the likelihood that this will happen? ANSWER: you can't know for sure, but what are the chances a reputable buyer would suck so hard at negotiation?     Someone with 2 years of commenting history on reddit, and 35 pages of steam profile rep offers market value for your courier, and offers to send paypal first, but has no rep thread and has never heard of d2traders.     What is the worst thing that can happen? ANSWER: you get chargeback scammed and end up losing your courier. What is the likelihood that this will happen? ANSWER: chances are this person did not spend the last two years of their life crafting a bogus online presence so that they can scam you out of your 50 bucks.
Hello, I never thought of posting on here but decided to after reading this post:   Please read the linked post for context, as my SO uses the exact same reasons verbatim as the OP.   I've been with my SO for a little over two years now and we were friends prior to dating. We watched porn before we started going out and for the first few months of our relationship. We even watched porn together and everything seemed fine at the time. After a few months into the relationship, SO stopped watching porn and would get very upset if I told her I watched porn and stated a lot of the reasons that were said by the OP in the linked post (such as: "Why am I not enough?" "Why don't you go for a girl with bigger boobs like the pornstars?"). I explained to her that her insecurity issues are unhealthy and that I love her physically and emotionally, but agreed to give up watching porn thinking that it would help her insecurity issues. Fast forward to 1.5 years later and she is still very against me watching porn. Due to us being back home for the summer and my internship, we only see each other once a week and have sex that one day a week which is very infrequent for me. Whenever I try to bring up the idea of me watching porn again, she instantly becomes upset and assumes that I am losing attraction for her and I want other women. This is certainly not the case as I just have a fairly high libido and it's hard to masturbate without some sort of visual stimulation. She is also very insecure about her breasts even though I LOVE her titties. She has small boobs and always compares herself to other pornstars/women with big jugs, but I've always told her I love her boobs and don't care about the size! Is there anyway to talk to her about my desire to want to watch porn without making her feel unattractive? Muchas gracias
There are plenty, plenty of real stainless steel watches that doesn't use any exotic materials or have much hand-craftsmanship (many of entry level luxury watches use ETA movement, which is prepackaged and only costs a few hundred) that costs 20X as much as this Huawei watch.   You are right it's not a high end watch, and at the price of sub-500, it's definitely priced like a low end watch. Entry level luxury starts at about $3k, and if you want more expensive material and an in-house movement (thus hand crafting), then you are looking at almost $10k minimal.
every time i go into the gas chamber for dead money and the satellite for old world blues my game freezes i've tried deleting saves  re downloading the dlc i don't know what to do
Hey guys.  I have a family member that recently moved to North Carolina.  He is 60 years old and has a severe nerve condition.  Not to go too far into it, the nerve condition causes severe skin pain, particularly in the legs.  For years, this person has lived in NY and has supplemented his prescription drug combination with marijuana.  He's taken countless piss tests at all of his doctors offices and it's been acknowledged by almost every doctor he has been to.  They had no issue at all treating him and even wished him the best as long as it helped the pain.   2 Months ago, he moved NC.  Of course, he had to find all new doctors..  He went to one doctors office, they piss tested him and found the marijuana.  They said they would not treat him unless he went to therapy, and even then, they would only go on the recommendation of the therapist.  Since then he has called 3 other doctors, all of which refused to treat him before even seeing him or having any knowledge of his marijuana use.  None of the doctors were willing to provide any reason as to why they wouldn't see him.   I have to assume that there is some list the original doctor has put him on that the other doctors in the state are referencing.  Is anyone aware of any list in existence?  This could cause a tremendous issue for him.  The pain management medications he is on require him to be weened off.. If he goes cold turkey, he will withdraw.  Some details or a point in the right direction would be appreciated.   TIA..
I work in a coffee store, and while it's not as popular in the summer, people love our hot cocoa. This hot cocoa comes out of a machine that has had its issues. We sell caramel and coffee flavored hot cocoa in addition to the original.   Yesterday, I made someone a hot cocoa and they sent it back to my manager, complaining that it was watery. So my manager decided that we all try the drink together to see if there's a problem. She made me try it first since I'm the guinea pig and I do the tough work as it is. If it's tough on my stomach so be it.  What she didn't tell me is that the cocoa is scalding hot (~200°F). So when I took the first sip my tongue lit itself on fire. I spit the cocoa out, waited and cooled it, then tried again. Of course, it was watery to the point where it was disgusting. Two others tried it for the hell of it and one lady just bitched out.  Then, my manager said we'd have to try the other 2 flavors. We tried the caramel and it was good. It was thick with a lot of flavor; the person who bitched out the first time chugged the second one. I guess we got away with that one.  Then came time for the coffee flavor. We noticed there was a lot of water coming out but we decided to give it a shot anyway. It was fucking disgusting. Not only was it watered down, the stuff was so bitter that it left a thirty minute aftertaste. And I seared my tongue again like it was a hefty chunk of steak. Of course, I was the only one who tried it.  On break when I was eating lunch I could still taste it. Then when i got home the after effects hit. The cramping wasn't too bad but I spent a good 15 minutes on the toilet. Oh well, could've been worse. But let's just say this guy won't be trying questionable products from our store again.
This bird made a nest right next to my back door in a watering can. It's about 2.5 feet from my door, and every time I walk by it flies away, startled. I haven't messed with the nest much, but I've glanced in there and I think I can see some eggs. I know you're not supposed to mess with eggs or the mom won't take care of them, but is it safe for me to move the can to a better location nearby?   My two big concerns are that my dogs will fuck with the nest or that when we move next month the maintenance guys will just throw the nest away. Also, we use that door all the time and I'm afraid the bird will eventually just give up.
This is a really interesting question, but the correct answer is that the virus doesn't have a natural coloring.   The human eye can detect electromagnetic radiation in a certain range of wavelengths; what we call "the visible light spectrum." [A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 390 to 750 nm.]( Pop that in google and you'll see that's 0.00039mm - 0.00075mm.   Still with me? Ok. Now another thing you have to realize is that in order to "see" something, light (from the sun, or the lightbulb in your room) needs to hit the object and then bounce off and enter your eye and strike your retina so your brain can turn those signals into a picture. In physics, they say the light "scatters" off of the object it hits.  One of the main ways light scatters is when it hits an object/particle that is larger than the wavelength of the light . This is why radio waves are able to go around buildings and over hills but you can't see someone who is behind a wall.   So getting back to the question about the color of the virus...  An HIV virus is about .0001 mm in diameter
I have been getting mixed input on what I should do with this situation. Since Reddit is anonymous, I feel like people will not have personal ties to what is happening and thus the input will be more accurate.   I have been dating this girl for roughly 1 yr and 9 months. We are now in college (I'm in Washington [state] and she's in Montana), so distance is pretty far. She's such a nice girl and everything has been really great while we've been dating, but deep down I know she's not the one. She obviously means a lot to me and so I am looking at how I approach the situation to make the best out of it. I think that we both need time to grow as people and think that time apart is the best. I'm not saying a break up is imminent, but I do think that space would be best. I say this because I feel like she has some trust issues and is perhaps a little less outgoing and willing to try new things than I would like someone to be. How would you go about this making it as easy and painless as possible?
Yes the original.   The original firmware on it wasn't smooth, scrolling lagged, animations stuttered, notification shade lagged, wifi was very very weak but I gave it a chance and thought it would get better. It did not.   Camera took 3 seconds to launch and the image quality was shit. the Z shared the same camera module as the GS4, so i expected the image quality to match that of the GS4 after software updates. It did not happen.   The device got hot doing barely anything. It would become very hot to hold when facebooking and using google chrome.   software updates came very late and the first iteration of a new android version was always shit, laggy, unoptimized and came with bugs. maybe one or two bugs would get ironed out in the next two or 3 releases for that android version, but the performance still sucked.   remember when kitkat launched? well, the Z got it in may 2014. Remember when google said kitkat would run even on the shittiest of devices? well sony somehow made it pretty much unusable on the xperia z. everything became laggier and sometimes the phone would randomly not receive/be able to dial calls. The fluidity of the device was comparable to my htc incredible S running sense 4...   I was honestly surprised when I got my S5 and how fluid it was despite everyone saying how laggy and shit touchwiz is. After owning my S5 since March and going through a few firmware updates, there has been nothing but improvements. Finger ID sucked at release but they fixed it a month or two back and now it works nearly flawlessly. The only complaint I have about this device is it lacks an animation when you press the multi task key so it looks slow and the home button could be a bit more responsive, even after disabling home activation for S voice.   so yeah, i wasn't happy with my Z, upgraded to a device that was "shit" and "laggy" and seems hated lots and I enjoy the fuck out of it. So if my S5 is considered laggy as fuck, i have no words to describe my xperia z.
I'm in silver, but I notice, that teams just want to fight. You can't just farm. No people want to fight. 4 vs 5 in the midlane? We wait 5 sec for the toplaner to come here, if not we go in without him, because fack his turret. Does anybody else feels like this?
BM = Bad Mannered , 4MP = 4-man premades, VOIP = Voice Over Internet Protocol ]   4-man Conquest premades. A subject that comes and goes and has been implemented in Smite several times and yet... has also been removed due the community going back and forth. I, as well as many other players, want to bring back 4-man premades (4MP), because we are playing with 2~3 friends. Many people would love it if 4MP in Conquest returned.   To begin with,  not all 4-man premades are BMers  . You could have a 4MP in your team which are nice to you or are just silent (even if you do badly!). If the BM starts from somewhere, you could just 1) Ignore them or 2) Argue. What I would recommend is to just ignore the person/people who start BMing and just play at your best. Because mostly, it is not worth the time to argue while playing because those who BM will just continue the BM which leads to higher insults/typing instead of playing (slight chance that they will calm down or be quiet).   This is not the problem of the 4MP overall though, but the people involved in the BM to begin with. If the 4MP starts bullying/BM towards the solo person, let them. It’s THEIR problem, not the solo person’s problem. They can’t help it if they get outplayed and do badly or play a role they do not play a lot: it could have even been a bad matchup. BM will not help at all.   It is not like the BM will magically make them play better. It is casual after all, it is not like the end of the world if you play badly once in a while.  The BM comes goes both ways though!  People seem to forget that, because most people argue that the 4MP is always the one who BM while the solo person is always the victim. That is not true, because the solo person can BM the 4MP for whatever reason, while the 4MP did nothing to the solo person.   Something I don’t understand is that 4MP exists in Arena/Assault/MOTD/Siege(when 5 man), but not in Conquest. You could use all those negative things about 4 man premades in arena/assault/MOTD/Siege as well which works both ways. I question this community sometimes, since HiRez has given AND taken 4MP to/from Conquest a few times over. You are not giving them the core game mode in Smite, which other MOBAs do include in their core game mode.   Community wanted 4 man, they made 4 man, community wanted no 4 man anymore, they took it away, community wanted 4 man, they put it back, community wanted no 4 man premade anymore and it is gone AGAIN. Please make up your mind, Smite-community.   It is either let all modes have 4MP, or have all modes 3 -man premade max, because it makes no sense to have 4MP in every mode EXCEPT casual Conquest . I am in favour of the former. Yes, I know that the matchmaking is screwed up already by the parties, be it 2, 3 or 4MP. Only time and more people playing smite over time will balance this system in the future. The argument that 4MP would be worse than 2/3 man premades is null, because the 2/3 man premades can just be bothersome as the 4MP. It’s the people's problem, not the size of the premades. Heck, in Joust 3v3 they allow 2 man premades.  THAT'S THE SAME . They control the ban. They will probably harass the player if they do bad or the solo player harasses the duo. If HiRez allow it in 3v3, then why not 4 man conquest?   Most 4MP have good coordination by using VOIP programmes, such as skype, teamspeak, dolby axon, curse voice and many more. But the 2/3-man premade can use that as well, right? I had times where I was with my friend(s) in a 2-3 man party(with or without voice communications) and went equal or won the game against the 4MP. You could have the attitude of “ oh geez, they have a 4-man premade, this is going to be a stompfest and we can just surrender @ 10 ”, or you could go with the attitude of “ Oh look, a challenge ”. It all comes down to skill and attitude of the player. Maybe the 4MP are just casual gamers who don’t stomp people and you might win, you don’t know that until you try.   Furthermore, the report system (if not already) should take into account multiple reports on a person that comes from a premade. As well as this, does the report system in terms of premades need to looked at or changed, so that the premades are judged correctly (again, if not already) and fairness is consistently brought to the game? Perhaps introducing other methods than just a simple report function involving a small choice drop list and a simple description in game that other MOBAs use could be handy some day.   In conclusion, bring back the 4-man premade for conquest. I really like to play with 4 man premades again in conquest, because I play smite with 2~3 friends a lot and other people would love it aswell if it came back.
Actually watching it happen every single day. Bacteria and viruses reproduce, and therefore have a chance to evolve, extremely quickly, but even in higher animals we have observed mutation and evolution time and time again. Lineages of old faithful Drosophila are a good case in point.   Every year you get a new cold. That's evolution of the rhinovirus. You have had several versions of influenza, and new ones regularly pop up to generate warranted concern. That's evolution. The "MR" (methycillin resistant) in MRSA is because of evolution. There are many different kinds of HIV. That's evolution. There are populations in Africa with enhanced resistance to their local strain of HIV. That's evolution too. Antibiotics are losing the battle with their target organisms: evolution.
the build is quite solid. there is definite heft, and nowhere near as thin as my wife's iphone4.  it is about the same size as my iphone3g with an incase.  sliding the screen up and down to expose the gamepad is silky smooth.  buttons feel solid but are a bit on the small side, i find myself using my fingernails to press the power button.  the volume control takes some getting used to as i either press too hard or in the wrong direction.  the gamepad buttons are small, but it makes playing emulators pretty fun.  as far as performance is concerned, i have not experienced any bugs or slowdowns. there is a lot of bloatware included such as att navigator and some games i don't really care for.   browsing and downloads are faster than the motorola atrix i had an opportunity to use a few months ago.  it is flash capable and i have not had any problems loading any websites. the camera is so-so, a definite upgrade from my 3g, but you won't be taking wedding portraits with this. i use doubletwist for music and it works fine for me. as far as using the phone as a phone, i have no problems other than getting accustomed to the subtle nuances of texting and dialing that varies from phone to phone. although it is an at&t phone, i have not had a call dropped and i'm living on oahu.   as for the gaming aspect which is why i bought the phone, i can't say anything about minecraft as i have never really found the appeal (downvote away!) but asphalt 6 and star battalion look great. it is hard to imagine that this is not psp and is a phone. the games play rather well, controls are responsive, but this is with the keypad. i am not a fan of the analog "tit-tays" or using the accelerometer and always preferred using the keypad. crash bandicoot plays exactly like a psone. madden 11 does not feel like madden at all and there are constant slowdowns. emulation is where this phone really shines.  mame runs well with the exception of some sound/music static.  no problems with SNESoid or Genesisoid.  i really hoped that this phone would be compatible with playstation network so i can play ffvii and psp games on it, but that is sadly not the case.  i was planning on buying a psvita when it comes out anyway, so it was not a dealbreaker for me.  i will download a psone emulator tomorrow and just download iso's from my collection, to get my psone fix.  bottom line, this phone could have been so much better, but if you like being able to play emulators with a dedicated gamepad then this is the phone to get.  i will be rooting this once i get more familiar with android to get rid of the stupid at&t bloatware.
im working on my old ford 8n, and while im waiting for my carb rebuild kit to get in im also trying to troubleshoot lack of spark, i dont think it is the coil, and ive gotten the points as good as i can from the angle im at, i've narrowed it down to the condenser, is there a way i can be sure it is the condenser? its a cheap part so i dont have a problem with buying it (infact i already have, an extra one never hurts) ive ran Brand new spark plug wires so the only thing i really have left is possibly the coil, and the condenser.
First off, write down a list of what your strengths and weaknesses are.   Secondly, ask someone that you climb with what they perceive to be your weakness are and why you fail on problems.  They get to watch you, they see how you use your feet, how you position your body, which methods you prefer, etc.. That's not something that you get to normally observe.  Alternately you could video yourself and try to analyze your climbing as objectively as possible.   Thirdly, update your list.   Lastly, work your weaknesses until they are no longer weak.   -Also-  Find an awesome v7 and work it until you send.  Then find another v7 and do it again.  Don't ignore easier problems- they are the best way to learn new techniques and moves- but start to get a few v7's in here and there.   After every gym session do some core exercises.  The ability to keep your feet on during steep movement is paramount.
Hi Reddit,   My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, and I so badly want things to work out with us.   However, for the first year of our relationship...there were signs that I shouldn't trust him.  He mentioned an ex of several years that he used to live with who he still kept in contact with.  He mentioned that right as we starting dating, she threw himself at him and declared her love for him and desire to get back together.  Now, he had no problem telling me this.  He mentioned that they still talked, but that it was cordial and he considers her a friend and nothing more.  This didn't sound right, because I continued to find presents from her around his apartment, and I noticed her name when she texted him (about every weekend, at least that I was aware of).   We had countless talks about this that were mostly tame.  He assured me that he was not giving her reasons to act this way (what I told him it looked like), despite her aggressive advances.  Out of his own desire he stopped talking to her a few months ago, claiming it was the right thing to do, and I was so relieved.   This was all for the first year of our relationship, before we lived together.  We have been living together for almost a year.   Recently he started talking about taking our relationship to the next level, and as much as I loved the idea...I still didn't know if I believed what he told me about the ex.  We discussed her many times, to the point that he got frustrated whenever I questioned her latest gift (e.g. his favorite candy, presents for his dog..), so eventually I gave up and dropped it.   This talk of "next level" (engagement) eventually drove me to confusion between what I so badly wanted and what my gut told me wasn't right.  I'm ashamed to say it, but I snooped.  I went through his phone and found countless back and forth conversations (phone calls, text messages, emails) from her simply telling him the details of her weekend, week, day to him sending her photos of vacations they went on together way back when.  Worst of all, I found a 'break up' text from about 5 months ago with her detailing that she can no longer talk to him because it hurts too much and she needs to move on. He wrote that he will always love her, and that it hurts him to picture her with someone else but he understands.   I confessed to my snooping,we had a huge fight that ended with me crying, apologizing for snooping, and him defending his actions/no apology.  He told me that all of the things he said to her were a lie to make her go away for good.   He told me it was unfair for me to think that he was acting cruelly by keeping her around since they were 'friends' for years after their breakup.   This fight was a month ago, and I have mostly managed to get over it.   But just my luck, this week when looking for a pair of underwear in his dresser (where I used to keep my clothes at his place before we moved in together)...I found lingerie that is not mine.   Of course I was horrified, but I didn't want to have another fight.  And frankly, it's possible it's from before I started dating him so I couldn't throw accusations.   Anyway, he was at first defensive but then apologized and explained that it was from a long time ago and he's sorry I found it.   I believe that's true...am I a fool?   I just don't know how to trust him after the horrible discovery of his emotional affair with his ex, and then the lingerie on top of this as an ugly reminder of the women he's been with that aren't me.
First day if freshmen year of high school. Everything went well all day, and I hadn't screwed anything up yet as I approached my last class. Along the way I see one of my buddies and I got excited and tried to high five him. He had other plans, and he shoved me as hard as he could as a joke, which would've been fine but I did not brace for it at all.   Now, also keep in mind that I was about 6'1 and weighed maybe 130 pounds at the time, so I was a frail motherfucker and my friend was pretty strong. Naturally, given all of these circumstances I was launched when I got shoved. My shoulder connected to this girls face. Hard. She grabbed her nose and and straight to the ground. I was trying to help but it was the passing period and people were everywhere, she didn't see me so I just ended up running away.   Next day I see a cheerleader walking by with a facemask for a broken nose on her face. It's her. I heard people talking and trying to find out who did it for the first month of school. I was convinced my ass was gonna get kicked.
So like the title says, I asked a girl I met through a friend out and she said she doesn't do one on one dates, only group hangouts.  I took that as a soft rejection because we didn't really know each too well. This was maybe a month ago.   But over the last few days, she's randomly texted me, asking if I'm coming to the gym we both workout at and just random stuff. Like today we've spent most of the day talking about book preferences, work, how she wants to buy a house, etc...   So my question is what gives? Am I reading too much into this or is she just being friendly. She could have asked our mutual friend if we were working out (we work out together), but she asked me.
I don't have a lot of experience with relationships so I'm not really sure how to handle this or how to feel.   I started talking to him in the beginning of March (one month to this day exactly). We really started hitting it off and he and I are actually really similar and comfortable around each other.   I guess we both knew that we liked each other but aren't officially dating. And today he dropped a truth bomb on me and the gist of it was, "I've been dating someone for a while now and we hit a rough patch and now I definitely know that I'm going to break it off once the week ends. I didn't want to give off the impression that I'm being deceptive or cheating on you."   I don't know how to feel, because on one hand, I appreciate him for being honest and telling me the truth about the situation, but on the other hand, it's left me with a bad taste in my mouth because if I knew that he was dating someone already, I wouldn't have pursued him and flirted with him (and him flirting back). I feel like it's disrespectful for him to treat both of us girls like that, even if he was going through a rough patch with his girlfriend.   I want to say something about it and tell him my feelings, but I'm a really non-confrontational person and I don't want it to make it sound like I'm attacking him. But. It's just left me with a slight sinking feeling in my stomach. I don't want to be a rebound. I don't want to be that girl. How do I know if he really, genuinely likes me or only likes me as a rebound, because he constantly tells me that he's never been this comfortable with another person before and he highly values the relationship that we have.   Again, I don't know how to deal with this because I've only been in 2 other relationships spread out in a span of 3 and a half years.   Any advice is helpful. Thank you all.
What others have said is true (that it depends), but generally it works as long as you don't get hit THAT often.   I find that it is quite comparable to other forms of mitigation if you are ranged + acro.  This way you barely get hit, allowing yourself to gain some end charges before the next hit.  In order to gain end charges you just kill trash, so it takes no time with something like Crit TS.   Then, when you are hit you should pretty easily have 3+ end charges up mitigating the damage you are dealt and making you immune to physical for the next few seconds (which you use to kill a couple mobs and you have your end charges back before the IC even wears off).   I took the End Charge increase from Oak in Merciless so I could have 20% phys mitigation in between hits and a 5 second Immortal call.  In fact, my 4L doesn't even need Enduring Cry (for obvious reasons) so I have:     CwDT + IC + Inc. Duration + Vaal Grace     The Vaal Grace doesn't get procced from CwDT, but it benefits from the Inc. Duration so I can have a 10 second dodge boost.  I find it works very much like a self-cast IC, you just have to get a few souls first (80% dodge / 80% spell dodge for 10 seconds is pretty unreal).  Another option over Vaal Grace would be Decoy Totem.
Reddit I need your help.  Many of you might be familiar with the local coffee chain Marylou's Coffee in the South Shore (and spreading!).  For people who are unaware, Marylou's is running a photo contest on their website.  I am one of the finalists and the voting ends TODAY.  The winners get a $100 gift card to Marylou's.   In light of the Boston Marathon tragedy, I decided to email Marylou's and asked if I won, the gift card go to the people who deserve it most: the members of the Boston Police Department and staff at hospitals who were working this tragic day.  I received a response back from their CEO saying they would match it for a total of $200 to be split. (Thanks KeliJo!)   People were working late into the night past their shift's end.  This is my small token of thanks for their hard work and effort they put forth in the name of humanity. If you could follow the link and click [pic #11]( and submit you could help make a small difference in someone's day who deserves it.  I honestly don't want any karma for this, I just want to give a give a small gesture of gratitude and this contest presented itself in an opportune time.   I did not want to post this on Reddit but you guys are my last chance.  I've seen how awesome this community is and how quickly something can spread.  I'd really appreciate your vote of support.
Mark's telling a story to make a point, and in the great context of this chapter, Jesus is addressing two kinds of blindness: spiritual and physical.  The spiritual blindness was the of the Pharisees who could not see Jesus for who he was.  Their blindness was total, like the physical blindness of the man at Bethsaida.   However, it was also the disciples who were blind.  Theirs was not total.  They had a vague idea of who Jesus was, but their spiritual vision was fuzzy--just like the blind man, who could only make out vague shapes.  The disciples were confused.  They could see, but they weren't sure what they were seeing.  Who was this Jesus they were following?   Peter, though, finally gets it.  He has the clear vision:   >27 And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” 28 And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.” 29 And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him,  “You are the Christ.”
Well, as you may have guessed, I need some help to pay for a few things. Incoming background story to sway opinions. I'm a college student who has survived cancer throughout high school and persistently worked toward being the first in my family to make it to college. I grew up in a poor home with only one parent, so my siblings and I were forced to raise ourselves from a young age. I decided to work hard and go to college and become something successful, unlike the rest of my extended family who were all dealing with drugs issues. Anyway, I got testicular cancer and overcame it through high school while also working hard on my grades. Despite numerous huge obstacles such as cancer and being homeless and sleeping under a park slide at times, I went on to graduate 4th in my class of almost 300. This led me to get a large scholarship to a college in a major city, so I went. Everything seemed to be looking up, but since I moved here, this city is my new home, so I must provide for myself entirely on my own. Lonliness and homesickness make a person crazy and stressing about being able to pay bills by myself at age 19 isn't helping. I was recently let go from my second job and do not have enough money to pay my upcoming rent. I absolutely despise the idea of having to live homeless again, especially in a major city like the one I'm in. So if anyone could find it in their hearts to give me any sort of donation, I would be thrilled to have a roof over my head while seeking second employment once again.
We've been dating for 8 months now, and we sleep together on the weekends when he comes over. I have a twin bed and as you can imagine, it can be cramped with the two of us sleeping. But, this is not the problem.   The problem is that he likes to cuddle and sometimes it is too aggressive. It is like sleeping with a straight-jacket. I like cuddling with him when he's awake. But, how do I tell him that when he is sleeping, he hugs me too tight, and it hurts me.   I don't want to hurt his feelings because I care about him, and when he is awake this isn't a problem and I like to cuddle with him. How do I talk to him about fixing his habit?
Hello reddit.   So my girlfriend and I met online in 2009. Live in the same city, actually met through a friend who was into BDSM (we were both active in the community at the time), hit it off. Totally connect, amazing sex, similar future paths. We were in college at the time. She's pretty, hilarious, has introduced me to some amazing stuff and on the whole is just totally mentally stimulating. I truly love her as a human being.   She's in her final year, I am done and have a solid intro job (save about 1000 a month).   My girlfriend suffers from depression and when her mom moved away across the country and gave her 2 weeks notice to leave, she started to withdraw in the winter of 2011. We got a place and she seemed to warn up and her depression faded in February. Her stepfather admitted to her in April that he was a serious alcoholic and I think this sent her into a harder depression, but by May things seemed to seriously be ok. I helped her in every way I could. Even took 2 weeks vacation off of work just to help her through it.   My mother died of pancreatic cancer in June and I basically had a mental breakdown for almost 3 months. I was incredibly close with my mom and for like 10 weeks I could barely eat, I cried every day, etc. She was only 38 years old and it really just broke my heart.   Instead of supporting me my girlfriend got so upset that she was like going into the bathroom and throwing up. She hated being around me. Her support waned after about 5 days.  Ever since then she has been incredibly passive aggressive.   The slightest thing that never bothered her before, like me forgetting to fill the car with gasoline or do the dishes, causes her to totally shut down and go "I think you should leave for a little while." When I prod further she just starts crying and goes "Get the fuck out of the room, please." At this point she is inconsolable. Sometimes for minutes, sometimes for days.   At this point I honestly think she is just totally broken as a human being and I don't know why. We've only had sex 5 times since June and last time was early December and ended with her crying mid-intercourse. The last time we had pleasurable sex was October, when I took her on a trip to PA.   I feel like everything about our relationship is just gone. I'm out of college now so I don't really have my college friendbase to associate with even though we play online games and such a few days a week and I have about 4-5 friends locally that I enjoying being with.   My girlfriend at this point has lost connection with all of her friends. She doesn't hang out with anyone, including her family whom she was previously very close with.   I am honestly afraid to come home some days because I feel like I might make some mistake like forget to feed the dog or do the dishes and she'll just guilt me or threaten to leave the house if I don't go out for a few hours.   There are periods of lucidity where she with collapse and tell me how horrible she's been. We'll make up. But in a few weeks it always ends up the same as it is now.   I think we're done. It's kind of hard to accept but I reached out to my best friend and he's willing to move out her for an internship for 2 years and live with me in September. I've considered it seriously.   I really love this woman. And I wish I could salvage it but she seems so emotionally broken and I just have no idea what caused it. I don't know if that's what is causing her pain or if she feels like I'm not reliable because of my mother's deaths affect on me   What used to be texts of "I love you~ Want to go out tonight?" and "Hey so I got this crazy thing from the adult store. Come into the bathroom when you get home." has become "My head hurts. Kind of feel dead." and "I honestly can't stand working anymore." I am honestly concerned about her. She has not exhibited any self-harm at all.   I have tried  repeatedly  to get her into therapy for almost a year and a half now. It is not working, she refuses to go. There is always an excuse.   I am at my wits end. Please, any advice or experience is welcome and very, very accepted.
I'm about 3 or 4 hours into this and loving it.  I've got 3 laser's pointing to the summit, (Monastary, Keep, Symmetry) . I've had a good look around and I'm just, well, stuck.   I'm hoping it's not just me, but I can't grasp the puzzles with Yellow Blocks. I get that they're supposed to be contained in segments of that shape, but sometimes that isn't possible?   This . So what gives? I get that I must be mistaken about how they work (probably the most likely scenario) but the 'tutorial' puzzles on it heavily display that. ([With the exception of this one which I'm also having trouble with for the same reasons](   So uh,
So first, to get it out of the way, I am a terrible person and don't plan well, apparently. Anyway, I'm approaching the end of my BSW (I still need to do the field practicum) and my class is requiring a realistically  built case file.   The professor said he wouldn't do it for us, but we could get help anywhere we wanted otherwise. If I was smart I would have taken notes when I was shadowing, but I hardly ever had access to real files anyway.   I can find lots of lists of the kinds of things that go into one, but not how they should be organized
Given the infantry resource cost, 1v1 a MAX damn well better win most of the time against non-MAXes!   Agreed.   > You're right that the damage buff is was pretty minor to begin with, I'm just bringing it up to point out that everything about ZOE is being toned down all at once.   For the most part, the numbers are being changed. The only functionality that's changing (that I'm aware of) is the free "on/off" switch going to "it's on for 15 seconds, off for X seconds". Will the number changes be too extreme? I'm sure using a ZOE post-nerf will feel like they are, as ZOEs will perform much worse than before. Does that mean it's nerfed too much? Possibly. I do feel it's in the right ballpark, though, and perhaps once some more stats have been gathered post-nerf they'll realise it's underperforming compared to other MAXs and buff it a bit.   > ZOE is a movement speed buff, that's indisputable.   Agreed. The extra damage is just a fancy extra.   > [...] the buff is now too small to justify making ZOE MAXes so fragile - especially for a unit whose primary strength is its durability   ZOE MAXs will be able to move almost as fast as sprinting infantry while firing, and faster than running infantry. Before, ZOEs could move in, kill a bunch of infantry, and run away if they took on something too big. Now they have to live with the consequences of those actions, therefore requiring support - this is a good thing. Don't like that risk? Use Charge instead, which the majority of TR and NC MAXs use as well.   The fragility can mostly be offset with the appropriate suit slot. Is it worth it? Time will tell. I anticipate a  large  amount of whining when people actually start using the new ZOE, because it's no longer the brutal killing machine it once was. That won't mean it's underpowered, the hype will have to die down first.   > You pointed out that making MAXes faster than infantry is a bad idea, period - and I agree.   Good.   > Making MAXes fragile is an equally bad idea, in my opinion.   Arguably so. Charge is a straight upgrade to a stock MAX. The ES abilities are definitely sidegrades, with the exception of pre-nerf ZOE which is a straight upgrade (extra damage taken is mostly offset by being able to evade). Assuming you want the extra agility/versatility - that is the VS's trait - of extra speed, what do you think would be an appropriate feature to trade in? Are you happy with the proposed changes, but wish the numbers weren't so much less in your favour?   If so, I firmly believe only proper stat gathering will demonstrate how well the post-nerf ZOE does compared to  other  MAXs.   This is all assuming the general idea of the ZOE is sound. I've seen various alternatives suggested, some sound appealing. Let's not forget that for the TR/NC, for most of the time Charge is the right ability to have; their ability is situational, I imagine there will be situations where the post-nerf ZOE will excel (whereas currently it's simply better everywhere).   Overall, I think you make valid points. I don't think the outcry of "our ability is useless now!" is called for, yet, however.
I was waiting for someone to point this out. The only problem with that--check a lexicon for the word used for great crowd. No where in the Greek scriptures does it ever refer to a crowd of angels, it's always humans. And given that all the other things that are described in Revelation as "before the throne" and that JWs believe are in heaven, it just doesn't make sense that the great crowd being before the throne doesn't also mean they're in heaven. It's like all these things are before the throne in heaven except the great crowd, they're not actually before the throne. Did John write that just to throw everyone off?   Also notice how only the anointed receive the seal in Revelation 7. Then read Revelation 9 about the fifth trumpet blast. The great crowd doesn't receive the seal, but they're still on earth? Why would God do that? Why wouldn't he bring them up to heaven first and protect them from that? Read that whole chapter. Do you see any allowance for a great crowd on earth there?   And finally, Revelation 21- it's not either heaven or earth, it's both for both groups. Most Christians already understand that, and frankly it makes a lot more sense especially if you then read Paul's letters to the Romans and Corinthians or even Jesus' own words about his flesh and blood in the gospel of John.
I imagine your excellent retelling of this story is also an indication of how thoroughly realistic Sue_Plex was.  You probably did the guy a favor. He probably needed a cold sweat panic session of being afraid of losing everything to re-evaluate his situation.  A friends' uncle just shot himself.  One of those 'catch a predadtor' type deals he got caught in. The charges were soliciting a minor and he shot himself instead of making his first day of trial. Obviously he didn't want to do time as a chester, and of course he had nothing left in his life even if he had been acquitted, but none of this needed to happen.  I never met the guy but from what my friend told me he never acted like a pedo-creep; remember this is her uncle. If the guy had just spent less time in internet fantasy land, where one's fantasies get a little more intense after every hour, he probably wouldn't have contacted the honeypot.   Probably more interesting is how the sting works.  The local police put up a picture of an underage girl on a message board.  They do not mention her age, only some contact info. It is the only if the John intentionally seeks out her age, then proceeds to set up a meet knowing that she's a minor, does he get busted.   Before this relates back to "dave", it's critical to know that someone seeking sex with a young- looking  girl is easily accomodated.  But this Uncle  specifically  needed this girl to be  underage , probably because it was more taboo.  Why not just hire a pro to do age-play with instead of committing a life-ending felony? It's because of the growth of the obsession.  When teenage boys first look at porn, they don't immediately go to extreme-fetish chat boards.   So is the case with Dave.  That definitely wasn't the way that he lost his virginity.  He was def on a quickly increasing grade as evidenced by his immersion into Sue and his pace-quickening obsession messaging.  you gave him a cold hard kick in the nuts that he really needed.
E-mail or texting. Think about it. The people of the first decade of the 20th century have only been exposed to long distance mail via carrier pigeons or couriers. The Pony Express was the quickest way to mail letters or packages, and that was still an average of 10 days travel. In 1900, cars had only just been invented, and wouldn't be popularized for another 8 years, in 1908 when the Ford Model T was mass produced.   Fast forward 71 years, and you have the very first e-mail being sent, an instantaneous form of communication across devices that can theoretically be any distance apart from each other on the planet. It would be another 21 years when the first text between cell phones was sent.   Imagine trying to explain this to the average citizen of the year 1900.  "Well, you see, we have this way to communicate, using these boxes with screens... Not like, door screens, they're kind of glassy, sometimes not... Let me back up..."  You see, you'd have to explain this magical box, with this magical force that allows two of the magical boxes to communicate from any distance, and then get into the whole 'technically it's travelling to space and back,' then you have satellites (magic floating magic force emitters)... It's a really, really complicated process that we all take for granted, and I just don't even know where I'd begin with explaining it.
I see a lot of people getting weirded out over middle schoolers like Serara and Minori earning crushes over guys  way  older than them so I'm going to take a moment to explain something.   This phenomenon isn't entirely unnatural even in the real world. I worked as an assistant teacher for a year and still volunteer at my local school and I was a bit surprised to find that this kind of thing isn't very uncommon. I'm not a Cassanova but I can definitely take a hint when it's given and kids are pretty forthright and obvious about that stuff as opposed to adolescents.   At first I was really creeped out by it but then I thought about it for a little bit and decided that it's no big deal. Of course as a 23 year old I'm not going to date a 7th grader that I'm mentoring but I don't shut down her crush because it's completely harmless. It's more of an adoration born of respect for me and the attention that I give her I think more than us being an actual fit for each other and she will find that out on her own, for many kids it's part of their maturing process.   Kids even younger often make claims that they will marry their father/mother or brother/sister. It's just kinda how kids are while they are still learning about those feelings.
EDIT* I WENT TO BED, JUST WOKE UP SO I'LL REPLY TO THE COMMENTS NOW :)   Please hear me out. I'm a hairdresser and I have at least one client per week that comes in with the same ol' sob story that goes something like this: "I tried to dye my hair at home and this is how it turned out, it's horrible, I can't let my friends/coworkers see me like this, help me!"   Now, there is a MASSIVE industry for at-home box colours that you buy in the grocery store/pharmacy/drug store. You see the ad's on TV for that shiny, long, perfect coloured hair. You see the ad's in magazines that feature celebrities such as Beyonce and Eva Longoria. These brands are well known, such as: Clairol Nice n Easy, Loreal Feria, Loreal Excellence Creme, Loreal Preference, Garnier Herbashine, Clairol Perfect 10, Revlon Colorsilk, and the list is endless. These are brands most women have grown to trust through things like makeup and shampoo/conditioner.   These brands offer you something wonderful, the opportunity to save money on having your hair coloured at the hairdressers. But the downside is that you don't have the professional knowledge behind hair colour and how it REALLY works. Your hair won't come out like the picture on the box. (If it does, you got lucky, but your hair has suffered through some nasty damaging chemicals - which I'll get to later in this rant.)   To become a hairdresser, we have to study chemistry in the hair and how chemicals react to each component in the hair shaft after it is broken down. We know this stuff like the back of our hands.   These at home box hair colours contain the most damaging chemicals known to hair. Even if you succeed with finding the right colour, your hair will be dry and damaged. These chemicals break down the bonds that make the hair what it is. They deplete your keratin, break your hydrogen/salt bonds, and they contain metallic dyes/lead which are the spawn of satan himself.   Professionals don't use this stuff in salons for a reason. It is NOT SAFE FOR HAIR. Hairdressers care MOST about the integrity and health of your hair, because if we damage it - we lose you as a client. We use professional products that are safe for hair.   I have heard things that women have done after a colour has gone  wrong. Putting dish detergent, peroxide, household bleach, and other HORRIBLE things on their hair in hopes to fix their colour. Please DON'T do this, these things are so wrong.
One of my favorite players, CP3 has a big night again with 30 points and 12 assists. I don't get to watch all of his games but I feel like he only scores when he wants to/feels like it. There have been nights where he barely scores like 10 points with very low shot attempts, and other games where he absolutely goes berserk and turns in a great offensive stat line like last night.   What do you guys think? Agree?
Like it says in the title, I got a fake number from a girl that I asked out to coffee. It was a random girl at the gym so I guess it was pretty weird and "creepy" for me to ask. I thought it went pretty well though because we chatted and had a normal conversation. I guess she thought I was a creeper and decided to give me a fake number.
So a bit of background- I live in a fundie house with my mom and grandma. My room is next to my grandma's room, and every night I hear gospel blasting from her TV. She's a shut in, she goes nowhere and now has started listening to these televangelists and gotten my mom into them. It's a pretty shitty scenario.   My mom was eating some mashed potatoes at dinner complaining how they had no taste and I tell her "Be thankful you have food in front of you, you could be in Africa or somewhere else starving." and so she says "Yeah I'd like to live somewhere where God actually pays attention." so right then and there I lose my shit. Like quite literally said "What the fuck did you just say? Somewhere where God actually pays attention? And you call yourself a christian? Good thing I'm an atheist and don't associate with your sort." She loses her shit and practically disowns me, her only kid, and tells me to move out. "Technically mom that's not possible, see I pay about 1/4 of your mortgage and without me you'd be asking God for help, and most likely, you won't get any." So she goes on and on talking about how science is all wrong expecting me to get all mad (actually I found it hilarious) and eventually she told me the Earth is 6000 years old and blah ze blah. Man it went on for a good 20 minutes. And I sat there listening to it, and as soon as I opened my mouth she said "NO! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY OF YOUR GODLESS BLASPHEMY!!!" I now understand the 'Arguing with Christians' pics. That's about all that came out of that. I told my mom though "Don't close your mind mom, an open mind leads to an open heart. That's a primary reason why the world is so fucked up right now is because people like you won't open their mind, and therefore you will never open your heart." She was taken aback for a second, then said "Sweet words from the devil child meant to poison my mind!" And left the room, my face was like...Dafuq? Any advice on what I could do?   Why is the world like this where people shut their minds and hearts to their own family for what they believe? Something needs to change. But if I can't change my moms opinion (her acceptance on what I believe, not her religions beliefs) how can I change other's that are more fundamentalist than her? I just want a world where everyone can stand with each other even though they don't see the same. Is that possible? Not world peace just world...understanding/respect/acceptance of other's beliefs etc.
My dad was stupid enough to ride a scooter (yeah, yeah) in shorts and flipflops, and no helmet, aroind the side of a mountain in hawaii (road to hana). He ate it on gravel and received severe road rash on his arms and legs, keep in mind this was under 30 mph.   In order to get the asphaltdust and pebbles that are embedded in your skin out, doctors use steel wool and scrape the affected areas (ever wash a dirty pan? yeah, that steel wool), this is all without anasthesia. ATTGAT for a reason.   As for his face, his left cheekbone was crushed near his eyesocket. He had to undergo "cosmetic surgery" to fix the dent.   Ride safe, ride smart.
Question:  do you ever do a trick near or under a lift and have people cheer at you?  What's your interpretation on this?   I'm not the best rider, but this morning I hit a lip that not a lot of people do and got some nice air while doing a little shifty crail grab.  It wasn't spectacular and any decent rider could do it.  Then these kids started hollering "yeeeeeeeea" from their chair.   I wasn't sure if they were mocking me because it was a trick they could easily do or if they were just cheering because they thought it looked kinda cool.   I've never been able to quite figure this one out.  Anyone else ever get mixed up about this?  I don't really care that much.. I know I won't be doing triple rodeos anytime soon.. I'm more curious than anything.
1 Fan. This show is interesting, enjoyable to watch and looks amazing, its like visual porn, you want to see more of it but sometimes the dialogue and banter lacks throughout the show, weird pauses between speaking occurred. Also this may just be a me problem but the dad seems unlikable.     Plus I was given the impression this was an action-comedy cartoon from the pilot, but after seeing how they avoided animating a fight scene in the end of the first episode with the mom bug, I feel disappointed. Especially seeing how they downgraded the design from the pilot.       With that said, I hope people will give this show a chance, but CN needs to realize that quirky characters and comedy isn't needed in every cartoon and that kids, teens, adults love good story.
Hi all,   I'm looking for advice on a DB10 team.   Here is my box:   I can currently auto GB10 (95%+) with Veremos (L), Taor, Shannon, Bella, Bernard.   I'm trying to move onto Dragon B10 to get some of those tasty violent runes for my monsters, but am having a hard time, but I feel like it's mainly because my monsters do not have enough hp and are not all 6 starred.   Good news though! I have enough material for a 6 star, and will definitely have enough material for another one by next week once I have enough time to pop an xp booster and go to town on faimon (maybe Sunday, or next Friday, but it will be within a week).   My team that I've been trying to do DB10 with originally was with Veremos/Taor/Bella/Megan/Kona.   I feel like the base team of Veremos/Bella/Taor (since they're all 6-starred already) is very viable for any DB10 team.   Megan and Kona are 5 star and have really bad runes (they aren't part of my main lineups around 10-13k hp each). Even then, I can easily manual to the boss, but I can't get anywhere close to taking the boss down. I can burst him down to 50% hp real fast, when I go straight for the boss, but by the time the tower casts immunity on the boss, my Kona/Megan are dead, then bella can't maintain solo heals -- she's not violent yet.   I can rune and 6 star megan/kona to be 20k+ hp easily, but am waiting for rune removal day to do so.   HOWEVER, would those 2 be my best option for a db10 team? Once I 6-star two monsters, I don't forsee myself having enough fodder to 6 star for another month, so I want to make sure it's the most efficient choice.   I just recently pulled a Vanessa. I kinda want to build her up to see if she can take me Conqueror in Arena. Currently I'm floating at a solid 1500-ish points at the end of the week. I'll have enough points to comfortably stay in Fighter 3, but feel so far away from Conqueror.   Re-thinking my DB10 team now, would Veremos, Taor, Bella, Vanessa, Chloe be a good lineup? It sounds good to me, but at the same time, I feel like my bias of wanting to 6-star Chloe/Vanessa for arena might be clouding my judgement. Would it be wiser to 6-star megan or kona or another monster in my box instead? Ahman? Chasun? In my storage some monsters that may also work db10 include:water sky dancer, water undine, water death knight, fire sylphid, baretta fusion material.   My random thoughts when deciding which 2 monsters to 6-star:     I want to be able to manual db10 with the lineup at least 95% of the time. For auto, I'm fine if it's only about a 50-60% success rate to begin with (but with eventual possibility of 95%+ on auto)     Having a team work on db8/9 temporarily while my runes improve at a high success rate is good with me too, I don't mind farming db8/9 to get better violent runes before I can have a real db10 team.     TOA - Currently, for TOA I'm only able to get to about floor 60, haven't really put in the effort though to make monsters specifically for this. I have Baretta fusion lined up, I just have to fuse, along with other monsters that I've read are good in TOA, but I feel like other monsters probably take priority at the moment.     Arena - I can hold 1500 arena points fairly easily at the end of the week. I can get in conqueror in the weekdays, but get knocked out towards the end of the week. I kinda want to be able to bust in through to conqueror though. I know arena should be something to think about last, and I should focus on db10/toa first to be able to improve arena monster... but if I can improve on both fronts at the same time...? :) My Taor carries me in arena very heavily, I can pretty much hit all monsters that don't have multiple strong wind monsters in them. I'm hoping with Vanessa/Chloe in my AD, I'll be skipped over by some people who would normally attack.       What are everyone's thoughts on my situation?
Yes the "maths" are exact in the perfect situation, and in the same time I would like to say no because it's irrelevant. I'll start with an example :   Let's take a random guy with Flameblast. When he hit a Monster solo, he hit for  1000 dmg  and he has 300% burning damages (amount including Fire Damage, Elemental Damage & Burning Damage). This guy join a party, and there is a Support Curser in it.     Curser apply lvl.21/55% Elem Weakness (Enhance lvl.4 in +1), 20 Flammability, Ice Nova with Elemental Equilibrium, Temp Chain and Vulnerability.   the Monster got -176% Fire Resistance.   Flameblaster hit for  3110  with his Fire Penetration.   He got an Ignite. For 4s, but with +30% duration from passives and Temp Chains, it's actually a  10,4s Ignite .   The Ignite is 20% of the base damage, 622. Then it scale with Fire (&co) for 2488 per second. Then, with resistance (but without Fire Penetration this time, because it's not a hit) for  6866 .   Because of Vulnerability, it's also 40% More Burning damage, so  9613  per second for 10,4 seconds.   If he wait the entire duration, for a  1000 dmg hit , he'll get a 100,000 Ignite Damage.   Supposing he's lucky, he'll proliferate for even more because the higher burn (and not the average damage) will apply, but let's skip this for now.     Because of Curses and Ice Nova, his hit was multiplicated by 100x. Did I forget something ? Yeah, let's add Triple Shock :     Hitting for  5909  and burning for  360,934  when you usually hit for  1000  only.     Doing 360K dmg when you hit only for 1K is impressive, isn't it ? Yeah, it's true but maybe you're seeing where I'm trying to go. Here are some points about why your Incinerate isn't 600K DPS.   Including Curses, EE, Shock in DPS Calculation is wrong. You can take them into account, but not in DPS for multiples reasons. It takes time to apply, it doesn't always works, it's not ideal for group, etc...     A large part of your Incinerate tooltip DPS is  Added Chaos Damage . Therefore, you cannot include Fire Pen, Flammability & co.   Monsters don't have 0 Elemental Resistance, simple as that. I don't know if there is an updated Google Docs with resistances, but like players, they can only have 75% MAX Resistance, but can reach 200+ Fire Resistance easy peasy. That's why Fire Penetration is so valuable, because sometimes even with double curses, they still have 75% Fire Res.   Curses. Some Rare Monsters are resistants to Curses, and Bosses in Maps got reduced effect from curses. -70% Curse Effect on Palace Dominus for example.   Shock is hard to get on target when it actually matter. Yeah, you can Shock with Incinerate, but most of the time white monsters will die before getting shocked, and higher HP monsters aren't going to be shocked, and if they do, they're already dead.   You cannot always Shotgun everything and include 3 hits for 100% uptime.   As I said, getting Shock isn't instant (20% Chance max with Static Blows), applying Curses takes time (yeah, they do), reaching max Stage Incinerate takes time, etc...     So at the end, yeah that's why DPS can seems so hit with perfect conditions, but in reality it's harder than that. Applying Double Curses on every trash monster will slow you, because what's the point of "wasting" 1 second to curse if you already kill them in 0,4s without ?   Most of the time, if you've a high dmg build, it's better to attack sooner instead of trying to curse, and that's specially true with Incinerate because of the stages. Monsters will move, and sometimes you'll have to stop casting and also move to reach them.
Basically, when I(f/20) was 13, I was forced to, while being held down using a knife, to give a guy head. I don't remember who the guy was.. I just remember being terrified out of my mind after it. I don't even fully remember the scenario except that I was walking home from my friend's house and it was around late February/early March because it was darkish by 6 but not completely dark and it was getting somewhat warmer.   My boyfriend(24) and I had been dating for about 5 months and this is my first very serious relationship. We've had slight problems with communication because I don't ever complain when something's wrong (mostly because I usually feel like it's not that big of a problem) or when talking about my own life, I don't wanna seem like I make a big deal out of everything.. so I just don't make a big deal ever about anything...   I don't think that this attack has really affected me...I kind of chose to forget about it/never mention it ever since I was 13 and since then, it hasn't had much influence on my love life - I never did anything I didn't want to do, lost my virginity when I was 19, am pretty secure about my appearance, etc... But I (as a curvy girl with legit a small waist and large "assets") never dress sexy because I don't like the attention I get when I do.   Sorry I went off on a tangent there... but yeah. We recently had a discussion on communication because my ex-boss (m/26) was being inappropriate to me while we were alone in his apartment. Before you assume that I was just being irresponsible, my relationship with my ex-boss has been mentor/mentee. He got me my job now, we've vacationed with his family + his girlfriend, and he has smoked me up more times than I can remember.. and he has never ever ever been inappropriate. We've known each other for a few years now.
My boyfriend and I have been together for two and a half years and are extremely good at communicating, to the point where there isn't anything he doesn't know about me and, I assume, that if I needed to know something about him I could ask without fear. A few months ago he opened up to me about how he wanted to try and open the relationship because he felt that, even though he's what we have, he was missing out on his prime adventure years and because he suffers from self esteem issues it would be a great boost in confidence. I have typically been the type of person forming monogamous bonds but I wasn't against the idea, there were certainly people I had in mind that I wanted to connect with in that way. Additionally, his libido is double mine, so I was glad to  give him the opportunity to go out and not only express that, but to realize how attractive and desirable he is. We agreed that we can't host because of our room mates, and that we would let each other know when something happened so we can be extra careful about being clean/ready for when we spend time together.   This started on a Friday so it was the perfect time to browse apps and hit up the people I had in mind. My first two prospects fell through merely because they wouldn't be available any time soon to meet so I downloaded apps like Grindr and Scruff to see what was out there. I was having a great time meeting people, and my bf found someone to hook up with for a quick blowjob and I was surprised at the lack of emotion I had about it. Even though I thought I would have lingering effects of my monogamous lifestyle, I was genuinely glad for him and excited that I could find something like that for me. A day later I had a meeting of my own and enjoyed myself.   After that meeting however, I started to realize that this wasn't really something that was worth the effort for me. My phone was exploding with people who wanted to talk and by necessity I had to focus my energy on the people who seemed the most genuine and fun to be with while I balanced school and work. I literally responded to every message, and once the conversation dried up and the person stopped messaging me I moved on. This started happening a lot. It gave me the impression that people are as busy as I am, or just not as interested as their initial "woof" made them out to be, or they wanted something else out of me. This didn't bother me. I was using my own face picture so they wouldn't be mislead, shared picture for picture for the fun, and my profile clearly stated I was in an open relationship and I answered honestly when asked. I felt like I was a fairly open book, willing to chat about and be open to pretty much anything. I ended up having a second meet that went well, and to no fault of the person I was with, I just wasn't that into it anymore. It felt like a huge waste of energy for such a small reward. I suppose that's why they call it the hunt; I was only turning up fallen nuts compared to a meal of rabbit.   I should take this time now to mention that my bf is fucking hung. Like, I am a bottom and love servicing him immensely, but his 6" circumference takes a lot of warming up to handle and most of the time my preparations aren't enough no matter how careful we are. This has made me (feel like) a master of oral, able to turn even the most taciturn deniers of being able to cum from it into believers. This is important, because when he told me he was able to fuck someone, my insides turned to ice. I had no idea what was happening. I was at work and I couldn't breath and my heart was racing and I had to run to the bathroom to splash water on myself and calm down. It was the first time I had a panic attack in years. When I got home I told him about it, almost crying, and we cuddled and talked for hours that night about what caused it. We came to the conclusion that, due to my childhood of having two parents that messed me up emotionally through neglect and cruel acts and the fact that I never had anyone that was solidly in my corner looking out for me, I may have abandonment issues. The idea that someone could do something so casually that I had such a hard time achieving made me paranoid about becoming inferior. After doing more research and talking to others we felt that was the best reason. I told him that I know he isn't just going to walk out on me because he found someone he can top, but that I have no idea how to control this agonizing reaction I get when I think of someone being able to do what I can't. Bless his amazing ways, he said that he would close the relationship on his end until we figure out how to fix me, but that he wants me to still talk to others and see if there is someone in an open relationship that had to deal with similar issues. Additionally, I started reading Ethical Slut as per his recommendation, saying that he hadn't read it but his friends that had problems with polyamorous relationships had and it helped a ton.   Now, I am going to test the truly sex positive nature of this board with this next statement and I pray that those here follow the FAQ in how to handle what I'm about to say. I am zeta. I love animals. Not only for emotional support, but because of that intense, electricity to your stomach "I need to get off right now holy shit this is so hot" nature of them being so passionately sexual. I was HUGELY relieved when I found out he didn't care about that at all. It is so rare to find someone I am so emotionally compatible with that also supports that immutable part of me. It was most of the reason I was afraid to date as a kid. I am insanely lucky to find the person I did. This creates one huge problem for me though. If I am going to go into a panic every time he tells me about his escapades, how could I possibly say I'm not ok with it when he does not give a single shit about me screwing the pooch? I've brought this up to him and we've agreed that if I cannot get a handle on my panicky knee jerk reaction, then the experiment is over and we go back to being monogamous.   What does that mean about the future though? Do I just wait until we move out and I can distract myself with a pet while he goes and does his thing? That doesn't seem healthy, it feels like I'm just ignoring my amygdala, never truly addressing the problem and running from it. I really want to be ok with this. I know that I won't be as excited to hear about his adventures as he is with me and I'm fine with that. I want to meet him in the middle though, I don't want him to feel like he can't share something with me. I want to get over this terrible, illogical pain I feel every time I think about him with someone else, this sick feeling that I know is not from a rational part of my mind. In turn, he doesn't want me to suffer like that.
This article made my head hurt, but not because I'm a panthers fan. It made me hurt because of the flaws in logic that the writer is using.   By the way--  My friend literally called some guy at Bleacher Report and they gave him a job over the phone.  My friend also knows nothing about sports.  He fully admits to being athletically retarded.   In the article, the writer attacks two flaws in Carolina, but does so without any weight.     We have a poor passing attack     YES. You're absolutely right. Did we ever claim to be a passing team?  Have you watched the games that we've won?   The fact that our passing is weak is irrelevant, as we saw in Week 10. We didn't throw for shit. We won 12 games because of our dominant front seven and a four-headed running game that could consistently put up twenty points.
The "voices" in your head aren't actually speaking a real language, but rather what linguists (at least my professors) call "mentalese". Your mind processes thoughts and then those thoughts are translated into a language that you know. It's the same way that babies can think and process without learning a language. So the person would still be able to hear the voices, they just wouldn't be in any form of language that we would understand.
Most simple answer: watch actors (chick flicks usually have the best outfits for guys, assuming you are).  Celebrities dress so well and put  a lot of effort into how they appear in front of the fans. All you have to do is find an easy enough outfit to start with.   Next! /r/malefashionadvice is a great sub to help you. You can try to imitate looks you enjoy, or you can read their wiki. They teach you a lot about the basics. Best part is you can ask questions on the simple questions threads daily!   As for what I do, personally, I just see the "algorithm" (forgive my lack of a better term) behind all of these, and then I can create my own outfits. That said, there is no one rule to create the top and pants.   When it comes to shoes, you can make them either blend in with the pants (I can't afford to buy many shoes, that's what I usually do). Or, you can make them match your belt or watch for example.   Gloves, scarves and hat have to match. Usually I just buy them all with the same color. But either way, your best bet is to probably find repeated colors in your outfit. What I mean by that is, to build a basic outfit, I follow these rules:     Find a top (two colors for example) that I'd like to wear     Pants matching the secondary color of chosen top     Shoes blend in with pants     Hat/scarf that doesn't clash with the shirt     Wear a black leather watch.
Since some of Valors greatest asset is your ability to get both into and out of situations with your huge movespeed out-of-combat, it really sucks that a single minion hit count as in-combat. It doesn't matter if you're splittpushing or chasing down a low health target, u can bet on it being at least 1 minion left to ruin your day. Since the difference in speed in-and out of combat is so big, it's really hard to continue if you first get slowed once since the reset also is pretty long. Quinn isn't really top tier right now, and i don't really think this small change will make her OP, but rather just give her a little more edge in different situations.
This is so true. This happened to me in middle school through highschool. Mind you that means things were weaker but I got all of the "Eww you are my best friend" schpiel. I finally just caved and told her how I felt and basically said "I have too strong of feelings for you to not have you be mine. If you don't like me I cannot stand to be around you because it hurts." She shrugged me off and I moved on. Two days later she was at my door step begging me to take her back.
If you do drop out, make SURE your exiting grades don't suck. I did this 16 years ago and thought I would never care and took an F instead of a withdraw and now my GPA entering into the Uni was 3.8 but is now 1.18 because I screwed up SIXTEEN years ago.
In Sunday's episode Benjenhands emptied the blood of the rabbit into the cup and told Bran to drink it. I really didn't see anyone discuss this at all.   If we consider this scene in regard to the episode title there might be indications that feeding Bran blood will make him stronger (as speculated being an important factor behind the Three Eyed Raven's powers).   Wouldn't it be cool if Bran shortly after consuming the blood of the rabbit would upload the rabbit's life into weirwood.net and therefore realize that through  consuming blood Bran would expand the "knowledge" of the weirwoods . This explains the skeletons in Bloodravens cage. It even puts further symbolic meaning behind Bloodraven's name, since Blood would expand his knowledge - his vision of the world. Raven's, like many other birds, are known for their great vision - their oversight. So for Bran to obtain more oversight of the entire world, he has to consume as much of the World and its beings as possible? This also explains the theory of Jojen Paste, since that would be a fast and tremendous upgrade of Bran's powers - if indeed consuming blood is the essense behinds Bran's expanding power.   This is a quote from when Bran meets Bloodraven for the first time:     "Are you the three-eyed crow?" Bran heard himself say. A three-eyed crow should have three eyes. He has only one, and that one red.  Bran could feel the eye staring at him, shining like a pool of blood  in the torchlight. Where his other eye should have been, a thin white root grew from an empty socket, down his cheek, and into his neck.  (BRAN II, ADWD)     If we acknowledge that blood is knowledge, the single eye of Bloodraven looking like  a pool of blood  gets symbolic value. He has this single eye, and with it he can see all the knowledge pooled from the blood he has consumed. The more blood. The more he can see. Thus  blood = knowledge = power . His eye is also red, which might also be a hint.   The weirwood trees are often described as  weeping blood , having  blood-red leaves  and other blood related descriptions. Here's an example:     "He turned back to the weirwood and studied the carved face a moment. It is not the face we saw, he admitted to himself. The tree's not half as big as the one at Whitetree.   The red eyes wept blood ,  and he didn't remember that either. Clumsily, Sam sank to his knees. "Old gods, hear my prayer. The Seven were my father's gods but I said my words to you when I joined the Watch. Help us now. I fear we might be lost. We're hungry too, and so cold. I don't know what gods I believe in now, but . . . please, if you're there, help us. Gilly has a little son." That was all that he could think to say. The dusk was deepening, the leaves of the weirwood rustling softly,   waving like a thousand blood-red hands .  Whether Jon's gods had heard him or not he could not say.  (SAMWELL III, ASOS)     Here's an example of how Bran comes to contact with the blood spilled near weirwoods:     Then, as he watched, a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees before the heart tree. A white-haired woman stepped toward them through a drift of dark red leaves, a bronze sickle in her hand. "No," said Bran, "no, don't," but they could not hear him, no more than his father had. The woman grabbed the captive by the hair, hooked the sickle round his throat, and slashed. And through the mist of centuries the broken boy could only watch as the man's feet drummed against the earth … but as his life flowed out of him in a red tide, Brandon Stark could taste the blood.  (BRAN III, ADWD)     So all I am trying to say with this is that there are clear hints that the weirwood.net is running its database on blood power. Bran needs to connect to this, and expand through further blood consumption. The point here is that Bran cannot only observe and interpret the blood knowledge of the weirwoods - he needs to reform his  own blood  to be one with nature by consuming blood from nature.     "A paste of weirwood seeds." Something about the look of it made Bran feel ill. The red veins were only weirwood sap, he supposed, but in the torchlight they looked remarkably like   blood .  He dipped the spoon into the paste, then hesitated. "Will this make me a greenseer?"  " Your blood   makes you a greenseer," said Lord Brynden. "This will help awaken your gifts and wed you to the trees."  (BRAN III, ADWD)     So what I am getting out of all of this is that Coldbenjenhands (in the show at least) is speeding up Bran's process of fully becoming the Three Eyed Raven by feeding him blood. Coldjen bands also stated that "When the Night King comes you will be ready, waiting for him". This leads to my second small catch.   I looked up the meaning of the name Brandon. The name Brandon itself means  a hill covered with broom , which is either completely stupid to theorize about or in stead has something to do with the implication that he will  arise and see the world above like a hill . All this while being "covered in broom" -> being one with nature (?)   If we go away from that hugely insecure theorization we find the Celtic name  Brendan  which means  prince .     Is Bran the Prince That Was Promised?     Thanks for reading. I'm sure I'm completely wrong in some of this, but I just couldn't keep all the notions of blood out of my head. If you go for a search of the two words  "Blood"  and  "Bran"  you will find many interesting quotes from the books and a general huge emphasis on blood in Bran's chapters. Maybe blood will be his key to rise up against the Night King.
I don't think so. Its a finnicky issue, because, like someone mentioning they're pale or dark haired or have monolids,  it's another facet of the look to be taken into consideration.   However if someone is saying, "Look at me, I'm trans. Look how trans I am. Check out my social justice LOOK LOOK TRANS LOOK," I think that would be the same as when people are like, "I am so pale. I am so pale I am literally Casper dipped in snow LOOK GUYS LOOK AT MY PALENESS I AM THE PALEST OF THEM ALL P A L E!"   EDIT: Sorry everyone, I was trying to draw an oversimplified comparison between two issues (which in any other context I would never compare) and it came off rather transphobic. That was not my intention.
When I was younger there was this insufferable girl in my band class. I hated this chick with a passion. She just had the most annoying personality and was so full of herself and just a bitch to everyone. Anyways, found out she got hit by a car and broke her arm. I was like that sucks, but didn't care much. When she came back I heard her talking to her friends and not only did she get hit by a car, but when the paramedics and cops came, she got a ticket for jaywalking and had to pay for the damages to the car. I could not stop laughing at the fact that she got a ticket too.
But there is a chance that this one discovery will lead to an avalanche of other discoveries that completely reshape how we think about the universe and lead to changes in our civilization that we cannot even imagine yet.   I've got my fingers crossed for an F
Hello all, I don't know where to ask (and my first post), but I would like to know the community's opinion. I played the first guild wars before and I had a lot of fun; especially in pvp. Now, I am deciding if I should get gw2. I've been researching a ton on google whether or not I should get this game. Most of the reviews are positive-ish. I've talked to some friends who have gw2 and I get a 50/50 response from them saying its a good game, but gets super boring and redundant. Some of them say that the pvp is fun (and they know I like pvp) but there's really not a huge incentive when you play though. I'm also thinking if I should just wait for some sort of expansion coming out soon? I'm stuck whether if I should get this game or not.
Hello people   So, as the title says, I recently got back together with my ex-girlfriend. We've been together for a few weeks, but were broken up for a little over eight months. Before that, we were together for two years.   Now, before I get to the issue, I want to explain our relationship. This might be a bit long, so scroll down if you just want to read about the issue.   I met my girlfriend at a dorm-party back in 2012 and we instantly clicked. After that, we were together almost every day.   The first year and a half was a wonderful time, until she needed an operation for her knee which caused a lot of problems. This basically meant that we couldn't really have sex or go out, as she could barely stand on her leg or bend it in any way. We tried, but every time it hurt too much.   Ofcourse, this took a toll on our relationship. But I loved her and supported her until she could finally have the operation that fixed the issue. Shortly after her surgery, she went on a trip with one of her student organizations for a week. I was working the entire week so I was pretty busy.   When she returned, she told me that she had kissed another guy at a party they had. She now believed she was in love with this guy and broke up with me. I was devastated. I had spent half a year trying to maintain our relationship through a hard time and this was how she repaid me?   I instantly blocked her out of my life and hit the gym, studied hard - all the usual stuff. She wanted to pursue a relationship with this guy and I told her I didn't care what she did as long as she stayed the fuck away from me.   Now, one and a half month later, she knocked on my door, telling me that the thing between him and her didn't work out. He wasn't really interested in her and she quickly realized she didn't want him either. According to her, she was thinking of me all the time. She believed we'd had a rough patch and had confused it for not loving me. I told her it was fine, but that I hadn't forgiven her and didn't want to try anything again. I wanted her out of my life.   So, six months passed and I was looking through my Facebook. Suddenly, I came upon a picture of her with one of our common friends. I thought the picture was pretty funny, so I gave it a like and a stupid comment.   My ex then replied to my comment and then wrote me a private message. She said she was so sorry for everything but didn't expect anything from me. She just wanted to tell me that she realized she was immature and stupid and didn't know what she had until she lost it.   I wrote her back that it was fine, I'd forgiven her but that it'd be best if we had nothing to do with each other. She agreed.   So, about a week later a friend and I went to the movies together, a lo and behold, who did I meet? My ex. She smiled and waved and I thought it wouldn't hurt to approach her for a small-talk. I was over her, had pretty much forgiven her and didn't want to seem like a dick. Also, what hurt could it do?   We talked and caught up a bit before the movie started. She mentioned if she could borrow a book from me that she needed for her studies. It costs about 200 dollars and she was hoping to save the money. I said sure. We waved goodbye and my friend and I went into the theater.   The day after, she wrote to me on Facebook about the book and I decided to add her as a friend again. She came over, got the book and left. But before that, we talked quite a bit. It was obvious we still had a connection.   After that, we started hanging out again as friends. I have tons of girl friends and several of them I dated at some point, so this wasn't new to me. However, as things progressed we eventually hooked up and started dating.   I was hesitant, however, because of the way our old relationship ended. She told me that the six months we didn't talk had been the worst in her life and that she'd changed and matured. She promised, if I gave her another chance, she would do anything in her power to prove that it was the right decision.   I decided to trust her. When the break-up happened, she was only 21 and quite inexperienced in love. I hoped she had learned from her mistakes the hard way. So we gave it another shot.   And things are going pretty well. We've realized what caused a lot of our issues and are actively trying to avoid them.   But now she is going on that trip again this year. And the guy whom she hooked up with is gonna be there. She tells me he has a girlfriend, but she also told me he has been known to cheat.   I don't really feel comfortable sending her off on this trip and I have told her this. She said she'll stay home if she has to, but that she was hoping I'd show her the benefit of the doubt and will try to actively avoid him - except for the few activities where they are forced into working together.   I really want to establish trust between us again, but it is really hard.   But I still feel bad about this. Am I right to be concerned or should I trust her?
She was, let's say a very big kid, and has taken A LOT of abuse for it, from both family and peers. She's now lost very much wheight, but according to her, not enough. She has the most beautiful, strong and attractive body I have encountered in my 20 years on this earth, but I can't seem to get through to her. Her whole life, and her well being circles around her wheight and belly in perticular. She has a very unhealthy relationship with the gym and gets anxiety if she doesn't go for more than a couple days.   I want to make her see that she's the most beautiful woman on the planet as she is, and I don't want to be with a toothpick. I'm at my wit's end, please help me with some outside perspective.
ohgod...at our wedding. We didn't serve alcohol at the reception for a reason..but it was at a resort with a restaurant and lounge on the property. At some point during the reception my husband's dad, mother and step-mother all went to the bar...on their way back to the reception a couple of hours later, dad drunkedly made a move on mom and step-mom of course wasn't pleased...
Lot and his family are sharing their evening meal with some strangers Lot had met that day and invited home. There is loud knocking at the door, and it becomes clear that a very rowdy crowd has gathered outside.   The crowd's demands are clear,   "Send us out those guests of yours, Lot. We want to chock 'em, right up the bum hole.   "No, anything but that," pleads Lot.   "Cut the crap, Lot. There are a large number of very hard cocks out here, and we mean to use them. We are going to fill those bums up with jizz, all the way to the brim. They will be walking funny for weeks, send them out".   The door opens a crack and The Mob's Ringleader is summoned over.   "Listen, these are my guests", says Lot. "Surely we can make some other arrangement".   The Ringleader places his scrotum in Lot's hand,   "Feel how full of Nut Juice those balls are, Lot. We've got to put all this cum in someone, the bible is clear, we can't just spill it on the ground".   Lot ponders, then,   "Here, check out these virgin daughters of mine". "Girls, show this gentleman your minge".   "Mmm, What do you have in mind, Lot?"   "Ok, leave my guests alone, and in exchange, all you guys can just hook into the girls here".   "We've got alot of cum out there, Lot"   "Look, you can shoot into their vag, down their throat, right up their puckered pink assholes, and all over their faces."   "Lot, are you serious?"   Genesis, Chapter 19, Verse 8  -  let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes   So , yeah, if you can just show me a moral code in the bible, I'll be able to tell you whether or not I agree with it.   Edit -
I had an interesting experience with HTC support that I thought might be worth sharing.   I was playing Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades late at night. My mistake? I wasn't wearing the straps during the skeeball-like minigame. When I threw the grenade, I threw the controller with it. The right touchpad button didn't work at all; wouldn't even click.   To make matters worse, I thought I'd open the thing up and take a look at the damage myself since surely the warranty wouldn't cover an incident involving wrist-strap negligence. Obviously this was the wrong thing to do...two stripped screws later and a torn internal cable I decided to give up. I figured I had no choice but to bite the bullet, and buy a new controller. I knew I voided the warranty, and I knew I had royally screwed up, so I contacted HTC's live chat support with the expectation of paying $100+ for a new controller. Figured my idiocy deserved it.   I couldn't seem to get the live support chat to work. It would randomly disconnect, and I was never sure if I was getting through to a rep or not. After a few minutes of trial and error, I finally got through to someone. The only way I can think to describe it is that the support representative seemed very preoccupied, and not at all interested in helping me. Kind of like when you text someone and all they reply with is "k." I'd ask a question, and only receive a partial answer. After clarifying, I'd wait a minute or two for another partial answer.   Finally, after re-iterating a couple times that I had broken a controller and wanted to replace it, the rep started the repair ticket process. I had originally wanted to simply buy a new controller outright, but at the time they told me that was not possible. [I think it is now, or at least will be.] The support rep told me to expect a quotation email and that I had ten days to accept the repair bill or they'd send it back in the same condition.   Fast-forward to a couple weeks later. I had already mailed the controller to the provided address and the USPS tracking number indicated that they had received it. Yet, upon checking the HTC repair tracking page, I saw that they were claiming they had never received it. This was a week after USPS claimed to have delivered it. This made me quite worried.   I contacted the live chat support again, going through the same technical difficulties as before. Finally, I was connected to a rep who told me they were experiencing some delays, and that he would manually update the HTC tracking page to show that they had received the controller. This seemed odd to me, since the rep was updating the tracking page without being able to personally verify that the controller had arrived, but oh well, at least he assured me things were progressing fine aside from the expected delay in hardware shipments. [Maybe a lot of people were breaking their controllers?]   Days passed. The HTC tracking page never updated, and still indicated that the package was never received. Finally another week passed, and just as I was getting ready to contact support again, I noticed that the tracking page not only updated, but showed completion of repair, and that it had been shipped back to me! This was bizarre, since the support rep told me I should expect an email with a repair quotation, and that they would take no further action until either I paid the repair costs or had it sent back to me. Fearing that I'd receive the same broken controller with no other information provided, I waited another day or two for the package.   Finally, it arrived. I eagerly opened it up and tried it out. The partly stripped screws seemed to indicate it was the same controller I had sent out, and I was pleased to discover that it worked just fine!   So I guess this is both a positive and a negative story regarding HTC's support. Negative because of the hassle, delay, and technical difficulties. Positive because apparently the expensive repair I was told I'd need to pay for was done so for free! Maybe it was a mix-up, but I'd like to think it was their way of making things right, even if that was never expressly told to me.
A few months ago, my SO moved 180 miles away for a new job. He is now living on his dad's land in a seperate building. I couldn't go with him, as I'm still at university. At the moment, I travel to see him every single weekend, and we split the price for the train journey. He very rarely travels to me because I'm at my parents place, and my dad is awkward about him staying overnight (don't ask).   Anyway, my problem is that we used to have a lot of weekends to ourselves, and now we don't. Now, we see his dad and step-mum every single weekend, and have dinner with them every single weekend. If you read this comment on a seperate thread then you'll understand why:   >'What is the worst mother-in-law/boyfriend's mom story?' by McThrasherin - AskWomen - 3 months ago   >My SO's step mum made me cry once. We were visting for the weekend, and I wasn't feeling very good at all. Now, you should know I am a shy person. It takes me a while to feel comfortable around new people sometimes, and I'm one of those who feels fine sitting in silence rather than in a loud group. Anyway, that weekend, I was particularly quiet. The days passed, and I had to leave earlier than my SO to get home as we live in different cities. A couple of days later, my SO tells me that his step mum was talking to him about me. She apparently said that I'm too quiet and it's anti-social. She thought I was being ignorant or something and said that if it kept on, I wouldn't be welcome in their home anymore. This made me feel so bad. It's not the first time someone has had a problem with me being quiet. It's not like I don't make an effort. I try to be as social as I am comfortable with. Now, whenever I visit her again, I feel I have to be this person that I'm not, and I don't like that. It's my SO who is with me, and he loves me the way I am. His parents/step-parents shouldn't put pressure on us like that. It's not fair.   I have been trying my best to put up with it, being chatty and smiley, but I cannot do this every weekend. It's tiring travelling so far, and then having to pretend to be someone I'm not all weekend. I've tried explaining this to my SO, but for some reason it's problem having a whole weekend to ourselves now and again. We used to do it a lot, but now we never do. Is it really that unfair that I ask for one weekend alone with him now and again? It's not like I'm permanently stopping him from seeing his family. How can I get him to understand that I am making so much effort travelling and being social to make everyone happy and I'm getting fed up of it.
I really find that self-documenting code is best.  I generally don't have comments except for a small snippet above each function.   If this doesn't work for you, you're code probably needs to be broken up into smaller functions.   There also isn't a specific dogma about JUST COMMENT EVERY FUNCTION, since if you're commening   //Gets X float&amp; GetX() { return x;}    that's obviously a waste, and for some very mathematical functions if you're making leaps and it doesn't easily map top smaller functions, comments of why you have a certain block might be necessary.   Besides that, I'd say that expressive variable names and well formatted code will make a huge difference.  Don't use a,b,c,d when you could have engine,index,transformed_coord, etc.   Creating maintainable code is definitely a good goal, but it's more than just comments.  Too many useless comments, is, in fact, bad.
I can't sleep tonight. A lot has happened and I'm waiting for a rescue ride tomorrow. I vouched not to take my sleep meds so my insomnia is keeping me awake and all I have right now is terrible hotel wi-fi.   I've been home now for two years since my mission. It hasn't been easy with finally getting diagnosed with what I've been telling people for  years  that I need help with: anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADHD. I've been through therapy, counseling, family support, doctor visits, dermatologist visits, struggles in faith, etc. and it continues on and on.   Let me be frank and say that I don't want to leave the church. I love the faith and deep down I have a testimony. That being said, it's waning quickly and unless something "spiritually significant" happens I know I'll become "less-active." I have very few friends within the church who have dealt with the shit I have and none of them have to be so dependent on meds like I am.   I served a faithful two years. I won't say where because people  know  me. My comment history already proves enough but whatever. I tried my best but my emotions and mental state failed me. I tried to be the obedient missionary but the "mission culture" and native culture were so terrible. I often got paired with troubled individuals who, bless their hearts, had no reason to be there. It often resulted in verbal friction. Hell, I taken anxiety meds because for three consecutive weeks I was stuck in the mountains in an apartment with nothing to do, no way of contacting my mission president, and an asshole who verbally abused me each day by telling me how I was a worthless piece of shit. I almost bought a gun with ammo from a native I could barely communicate with so I could kill my companion then shoot myself. And I tell you what, I wish I had. Every transfer after that was the same shit of working maybe every other week if I was lucky but weeks of cabin fever would prevail our schedule.   I take extra anxiety meds for PTSD. Without it I have nightmares and flashbacks. Nobody understands why. Nobody understands why when I came back I didn't want to say anything. I didn't want to disappoint anyone. I thought it was only that mission, that  country  with these issues. To this day I can't get them out of my head no matter what I do and I know it will take time before I can get them out. I requested several times to be transferred to a different mission or to be let free to fly home. Each request was denied and I continued on with the work feeling that I had yet to accomplish something there. But hell if I know what it was because nothing ever happened.   So I'm home and trying to rebuild myself. People say my ADHD is from anxiety but it was long before then. BYU is more than helpful for my needs and honestly I love the school and my job there. But what pisses me off is how everyone is all cheery and share their missionary experiences like very few things can go wrong during a mission. It's hard enough not being able to focus during church but when I have nothing to contribute on personal experience I feel alienated. Dating is difficult when you're a mentally fucked-up individual who keeps to himself out of a need for freedom and lack of mutual interests.   I know this rant doesn't make much sense because I seem to hate members but yet have a weak testimony and wish to stay faithful. But that's what /r/exmormon is somewhat about, right? It's about the painful and even deceitful part of the church that the "I-refuse-to-accept-that-I-live-in-bubble" Mormons turn a blind eye to. Missions either help you spiritually or leave you broken and fleeing from the church. I'm broken because ecclesiastical leaders make it seem like this is all my fault, that my mission is a mental scar because "I want it to be" and not because I put up with bullshit that should never have had been allowed to be given a name tag.   I can't stand being told to just "be patient." Bitch please, I've been patient my whole life for things to change because I'm always told that the problem is  me  and  my  perception, that nothing is really wrong with  me , that  I  can change all of this because it's "all in my head." The only thing in my head is a desire to be normal, something I can't be because I didn't pack up my bags and fly home at the first opportunity I had in order to get the hell out of that cesspool of problems.   I want things to get better and regain the faith I once had of my religion but as time goes on I see that it may never happen. All people want to do is tell me how I need to change myself to fit what others want me to be. Mind you I don't mean beginning "testimony-growing habits" but instead discarding my sorely-needed hobby of video games and software design to become some "clean-cut" MBA businessman while tossing out my hip-hop/pop/Eminem music so it can be a "Sunday-friendly" library. I need these things when my mind begins to spin so that I can be pulled completely away from the memories that come back from time to time.   I just want my mind to return to what it was before my mission. But it's instead a prison of bad memories and frustration that cannot be "treated" in any way. I just don't know anymore. All I want is for someone to put a bullet through my head so I can be freed from this tabernacle of clay. I'm not suicidal. I just want to be normal.
The same thing has happened to my best friend.  She doesn't have a job, still lives with her overprotective helicopter family, and never fully grew out of her weeaboo phase.  She's turning 24 next month and still has  themed birthday parties.   I find myself never having anything to talk about with her anymore.  I find her boring half the time because she wants to talk about her "novel" which is just another anime comic of hers with the same lame story and sparkly mary sue heroine, whine about her controlling mother, make the same comments about her cat, or bring up old jokes from high school.   I want to have a serious talk with her about these things but i worry i'll  hurt her feelings and make her lose the drive to do the things that make her happy.  Any time i've had the ability to i just can't bring myself to tell her how immature she is.
I dunno. Maybe just one of those subconscious things I guess?   To an extent you could say that they don't really fit. Takyon actually has a faster time signature(?) than Buddy Holly, so I had to slow the vocals down a bit. Also, I'd say that what I've done doesn't really flow all that well. Around the sort middle 8/guitar solo bit, the vocals kind of go out of sync with the music, or at least that's what my ear picks up. That's kind of why I cut the vocals up for the final chorus.
Possible genetic predisposition for low mood here, had clinical depression in the past. - fine now, but more low level mood than many others I know.   Ok, there are several tricks. The first is: you do not need to internalise every bit of time management, you have modern technology! :)   Your phone/iPad/laptop will help you in a lot of the following tasks.     routine: decide when you want to get up, when you want to go to bed. Set alarms for both! In both cases set two alarms. One that tells you: it soon is time to leave your warm bed/it soon is tine to stop what you are doing and go to bed, wrap stuff up and another that tells you: time now!     add other important daily jobs to your day planner. This could include half an hour running in the morning, study times... And your classes. - if you have problems keeping your place clean it needs to include half an hour cleaning per day. The better the tasks line up from day to day, the better.       Now comes the hard time: follow your planner! Do not say: but I don't wanna clean today. Do not say: I do not need to study right now! Follow your planner! If you do this for a week if becomes easier, if you do it for month the routine is so normal you do not need to even think about it.     add exams, essays, assignments etc. to your planner as soon as the times are out. Add a reminder for assignments and essays at weekly intervals starting with four weeks in advance. Use allocated study time to work on them from the first alarm on! Add an extra alarm24 hours before the things are due. You do not want to forget handing the things in!     ok, those parts were easy, they basically just say: follow a planner. They do not help with everything, though. Trying to manage several assignments at the same time, trying to make sure one is on time for meetings, etc.     for meetings, etc. FOLLOW the planner! Add them in, add an alarm for when you have to leave. If your meeting has to interfere with routine, add the tasks that got lost for later/earlier in the day. Plan every meeting which takes you more than a short footway away as if it was an half hour earlier than it actually is.     several assignments or other tasks at the same time. Prioritise! This one is the hardest thing. Everything else so far is just use a planner. Now you have to think. Important thing ( bigger mark percentage/ more pressing issue) should be done first PROVIDING the other thing would cost a lot of time to do. If the other thing can be done fast get it out of the way first. - this task is hard if you have problems realistically estimating how long a task takes. I sadly cannot give you tips on that one.     make a shopping list. Know what is in your fridge/freezer/pantry and add it on a list prominently displayed in your kitchen when you are running out. Buy stuff on list at next planned shopping trip.     say "no" to people. If you are one of those people who always help, pull the breaks. Look at what you have planned. You have a visual aide. Form of your planner. Help when somebody is in REAL Trouble, but not for every little thing. A. can find a good pair of trousers for her next interview on her own. You have planned to work on your COMPSCI 220 assignment. You are not abandoning your friends by not being on their back and call.     any unplanned time in your planner between waking up and going to bed is yours to do with as you please. Get used to routine before you add any extra projects on your own. If you want to start a project try to see if you can keep it up on your own at a certain time per day without your planner. If not, feel free to admit. :)
My mom told me as an adult that when I was 6 she had planned to take us all on a picnic to have one last good memory then shoot herself. She was going through some pretty serious shit dealing with things in her childhood she had suppressed. I actually wouldn't have blamed her once I found out about everything. Anyway, apparently I told her I loved her and she had to walk away sobbing. When my dad found her she told him everything and though they had been considering separation, they worked together to start counseling and she got her life back. Great, now I'm sobbing at my keyboard. I'm so happy my mom stuck it out. I love her so much. I tell her and my dad both every  time I talk to them.
So context. Three weeks ago I began slipping a rotation of world bosses into my daily. Kept an eye on the timers and did the events as they came up. Now some of them are relatively easy to spawn if you miss them, and when you start up the chain, people will flock in at the appropriate time (thanks guys!)   Anyways, for Foulbear. During the times when the event bugs on the status "Leaders are assaulting Foulbear Kraal". I would like some confirmation/clarification.     Is the reason the Meta bugs that the reinforcements that go to help Maybri or Finley die en route.     How do you un-bug it, or do you have to wait for server reset? I doubt the latter since it's gone up on my server a few times after that bug sometimes happens.
Why did DICE make such sweeping changes to the AS' performance? It now has no relevance to how it performs IRL except for the mag size and RoF. Not only this but absolutely no thought was put into the design of it, as I'll explain below. First off, I don't expect it to be EXACTLY how the weapon is supposed to perform in real life because it's a video game and all, but even in a ballpark would be nice...     The AS is terrible at range. When trying trying to shoot at targets ~100m I hit around 1/10 rounds while prone, ADS and semi auto against stationary targets. This is even more apparent when looking at stats and comparing to other carbines and assault rifle class weapons which have much higher first shot accuracy. The AS in Bf3 had extreme accuracy for the first 2 shots but the AS in Bf4 has atrocious accuracy for a weapon which was designed to be accurate. You might as well make the SCAR-H a scatter gun. The weapon should be more accurate. I don't mind high recoil and poor hip fire, realistically slow and heavy 9x39mm rounds, but PDW level accuracy for the AS is just an insult to it.  There is a reason there is a VSS "Vintorez" sniper variant of this weapon, folks.     DICE's own blurb for the weapon when you unlock it describes it as an assault rifle (it's technically a carbine but the integral suppressor makes it just slightly shorter than the AK-74M) so why is it trapped in the Engineer only PDW class? The AS fires large assault rifle rounds and was specifically designed for special forces and is used throughout the various Russian Spetsnaz brigades, VDV Recon, GRU, MVD, FSB. It's not a small weapon and as such it is NOT designed for the likes of combat engineers or vehicle crews; That's what PDWs are for, hell, that's the sole purpose of the likes of the P90 and Magpul PDR. PDWs are not designed for front line combat, the AS is. The
No offense man, but this comment is going to leave the wrong impression on people who didn't watch the game.  Steve never got violent, they never got physical--and hell, they barely even got into besides bumping heads for a few seconds and talking trash.  Smitty simply bottled it up until the very next play where he made Jenkins look like an idiot by [burning him for the TD](   Just saying, because many people already have a pretty low opinion of Smitty for the whole 'punching a teammate thing' as evident by it being brought up a dozen times in every single one of his threads.
I've played for over 3 years, I have never been muted or LPQ'd ever.  Almost every time I log in I have something say someone I have reported has been disciplined or w/e it is it says.  I think for people who have a good history, and solid reports, none of this 'reported for being bad' shit, the system works.  Maybe we get special treatment, but other than punishments being too lax, in MY EXPERIENCE it works.   For people who are constantly in LPQ or muted, flame or are 'mildly' toxic I'm sure they would be of the mindset that something's broken.  I'm sorry but 'mildly toxic' is still toxic, and that word tends to represent something in the extreme, so i think this term is misnomer.  I think the solution for those who think the game is broken is just to clean up their act, and I think they'll find the system isn't as bad as they previously thought.
Some background here.   I have been in beekeeping for 10 years. I am a certified Welsh Honey Judge. And I like helping other beekeepers.   We need to deal with helping beekeepers who are extracting honey to look at upping the quality level of what they do.   Let's look at what the general statements from beekeepers are.   1) Capped honey is good for consuming and bottling.   2) That honey with a moisture content over 20% will ferment.   These two statements are generally true. However this is about upping your game, not going with the status quo.   I do not bottle honey for direct consumption with a moisture content above 18.5% That is the max limit in most of the honey judging contests. I have three refractometers. 2 of them are the eyepiece type and one digital. I check every batch of honey that is brought in. I have have on many occasions said to turn the honey back to the yard because I won't sell it to people. I have some mead making friends who will get the honey with the higher moisture content but I let them know that it is specifically designed to make mead not sit in a jar.   Now for the fun. I went to two different yards and pulled frames over this wonderful 4th of July weekend. The honey from each yard gets extracted and bottled separately. We label each bottle as to what yard it has come from in some cases what hives it was pulled from. Honey frames must be 90% capped on both sides or they don't get pulled.   When I took reading from one yard. I got what I thought was a weird reading. 21% Moisture. I went back took the comb and went in through the cappings and took a reading. Sure enough 21%. I checked with the other meters and they all agreed. So I have capped honey that is higher then acceptable. It doesn't happen often but it does happen.   The other yard when I checked that showed 17.5% from the honey.   I don't heat my honey to remove moisture so the 21% is bee food. Maybe mead. There is probably about 4 gallons of it that I will give back to the bees.   Honey is a weird compound. Simple sugars that hang in a water base that will absorb moisture from the air. And in South Florida we have humidity. So moisture is there all the time.   Then to top it off. I am reminded that I have a gallon of honey in my office that has a 20% level and has been there for a year. I go to check it. It has not changed and another check showed it at 21%. However it had not fermented. I also had it filled to just about the brim so there was not a lot of air for the honey to take in additional moisture. It was for someone who wanted mead they never got it. I set it to the side and left it there. I still would not sell it as anything other then mead honey.   If you are looking at getting honey from your hives. Even if all you are doing is giving it to friends. Take the time to learn about honey it's ability to have and absorb moisture. If you want to up your game check with your local beekeeping organization and see if they hold honey contests. What are the rules for them. The idea is not to make you seem inadequate, but to help you up your standard.
Wow! Finally got a chance to check out some local gun shops and check out what they had to offer & also chat with a couple of them. Really gotta say, I was pretty intimidated but once I started spitting out my thoughts, there was some pretty good advice being spread into my head. Surprisingly, Bullseye had a couple Wingmasters (Trap 30" for $495 and a Skeet 28" for $350). The Trap felt a little long, though I know it's meant for trap.. The swing felt a little slower, so the 28" would be what I'd pick up.) The Weatherby PA-08 was a nice contender, but when compared against the Wingmaster 870 and the CZ612, the synthetic just didn't do it for me. They had a standard 870 for sub $300, which was interesting. Had the CZ612's (which felt amazing) for sub-$400... If I were to go pump, it'd definitely be between the Wingmaster 870 and the CZ612. Both felt natural and smooth.. Both were absolutely beautiful and stunning. However, it was the semi-auto's that have started to impress me. I still have yet to use a semi-auto for trap/skeet, but now I'm heavily considering one. Bullseye had a Browning Gold Unlimited for $600.00 that felt pretty good. One of their guys swears by the CZ's, and would probably prefer the CZ712/CZ912. Now I haven't heard much about the CZ712/912, though I'd entertain it if I heard some feedback on them. Regardless, it's a cheaper option, but most likely going to be a backup. What I'm really liking.. is the Remington 11-87 and the Beretta A300 Outlander. Both feel great, I prefer the wood furniture on the 11-87, but the price point is right outside my budget, with tax taking it heavy into the 830s. (If I'm right, it's 8% tax + dealer fees?). So,
It's not that it isn't effectice, it's just that people know how to react to it. And i would say that zerg isnt that strong early on even if we have some pretty neat timeing pushes. But i still belive that zerg has it's benefits in the lategame.   And my benchmarks depends on what i scout and what i have. and diffrent against all matchups.   But i still open pretty much the same way in every specific matchup.   ZvT:   9ovi   10 dronescout   15 hatch   If i scout rax+gas i go 16 gas 16 pool   if i scout cc first or no gas i skip the gas to later.   get 4 queens, 2 par or lings. if vs gas build i get speedlings when 100 gas and then pull drones of gas. Drone to 44/44, take my third, take second gayser, resatuate first gayser. put down dubble evo on 100 gas, upgrade melee and carapace, then get banenest and lair with next gas.   If i scout some preassure i get some lings, else i just drone up and controll the map with my four lings and ovis. at 6:45 i sack 1 or 2 ovis.   ZvZ   14 pool   15 hatch   15 ovi   15 queen   17 ling   18 gas   get 2 queens, 2 sets of lings, and get lingspeed, baneest 2xbanes and then lair with gas. just continnue droneing if i see no aggression. take second and third gayser at 6 minute mark and take fourth gayser when lair is about 30-50% done. Get spire ASAP when lair is finnish. And then get that third and some ovi and pump lings until about 60% of spire is done. then i just save up for mutas and get carapace armour for mutas.   ZvP   9 ovi   10 dronescout   14 pool   15 hatch   if i see gate+core i dont take my third before i know he put down his natural. else i take my third after i queue up my second queen.   drone like a mad man. get roach warren at 6:30 get lair when 100 gas then speed. then i get spire and hydraden when lair finish. and dubble evo short after i started my lair, later on i will add a third evo chamber. My composition is most likely gonna be hydra/corruptor/ultra.
I started (just a few weeks ago) by walking into a regular class, the professor (4th degree bb) was demonstrating some pretty technical sweeps from De La Riva guard. The class has a lot of blue/purples, so they just went through the motions really slow when I was paired with them. I had no idea what I was doing.   When we started rolling and alternating, I really started to enjoy the chaos. The blues and purples would take the time to show me how they passed my guard, how they put me in a submission, and then let me try the same thing on them. In addition, I was receiving quality rolling time, really practicing staying calm and breathing fully.   A week in, and I landed my first submission on a white belt with some stripes. I managed to slip into mount and throw and arm bar. Somehow I landed a very solid lever and he tapped. I'm absolutely addicted, now.
How far into the game are you? If you're just starting out and trying to figure out how to gear, I'd say pick a Trooper, since you and all your companions use the same Main Stat (Aim).   A common reply is "Which ever class suits you will do fine", but that doesn't help when you don't know how the different Advance Classes and their Disciplines play.   Another thing is that if you are far from the end game, who know how the classes/disciplines will play once you actually get there. For example, if you picked Sage/Sorc Healing over Scoundrel/Operative Healer in 2.x because of how they play, you might find yourself wanting to swap to Scoundrel/Operative in 3.0 because of how they now play.   One thing I would definitely recommend is that you don't pick a stealth class for your first (two) characters. While they are great fun, using stealth in this game usually just means that you miss out on a lot of XP, which you will probably need for your first (couple of) character(s). But when you have run through the planetary quests a couple of time, trying to stealth past enemies can offer up a nice new challenge.   While it pains me to say this, the only other suggestion I'd make is ...  maybe stay away from Melee dps for your first characters .
I have a hand stitched doll that my Papa stitched for me when I was born.  He was this big, burly farmer and decided he was going to stitch together this doll for some reason.   His name was J.R.  He was my buddy.  There is a picture in my mom's photo album of me at about 3 years old looking pissed off at the world because I had to have a professional picture taken.  But guess what?  J.R. was there with me.  Guess who also tagged along for the first half of Kindergarden?  J-motherfuckin'-R, that's who.  Guess who kept me quiet during long family road trips.  What's that?  Did you say, "J.R.?"  You damn right.   I'm 29 years old and everytime I go visit my mom, I check my stuff to make sure he's still there.  That little guy is gonna be handed down whenever I have children.
Ok....so I met this girl on tinder a few months ago (always a great start) we have been on 4 dates and had sex on the 3rd. Everything seemed to be going great. The second date was kinda weird because she straight up said to me that she thought I was "frontin" on the first date, when I don't think I was. Anyway, come round to last night and we go out to a bar for some drinks. One of her friends turns up and was completely hostile with me and asks if we want to go to a club just round the corner, so we say yes. Well when we get it in there we meet up with more of her friends who are acting really hostile towards me. Then all of a sudden one of the bouncers calls me over and asks me to leave. One of the girls told the bouncer I was being a pest...I was just standing there trying to talk to my date but they kept on getting in the way. Anyway I leave calmly. I then hung around outside for a little while trying to get hold of my date, she then turns up outside and we have a smoke and a chat. She tells me that her friends are really over protective because she was raped when she was 14. So we then go back into the club together and spot her friends straight away and they run up to a bouncer and tell them I have been kicked out already...my date sees this and does nothing and I walk out again saying "what the fuck...."   Now, I really don't know what to do, I really like this girl but her friends seem really crazy. She has apologised for what happened. At the moment Im thinking she could just be a maneater. Now the reason I mentioned about the "frontin" earlier is because I think she is majorly frontin me. She tells me she earns a hella lotta money and does a job that she isn't old enough to do. But says I'm the one frontin.
I'm torn between choosing useful pokemon for surviving on the road (like Miltank and Tropius, for example), or just going for my favourites. Mind you, judging by my taste for pokemon covered in blades, poison or flames, I think I might end up being a dead Pokehobo. In that case:   Miltank (for milk... obviously) Tropius (for flying transport, and bananas) Blastoise (for water transport) Mamoswine (for surviving the cold, and scaling mountains) Raichu (for... charging my phone? XD ) ... and Houndoom. Because every hobo needs a scary-looking dog.
This is great news, but it makes me sad at the same time.   I  want  to buy digital comics, but the current model just does not work for me, in terms of ownership and pricing.   I'm not going to purchase a product that I won't have ownership of. If comiXology were to suddenly go under, what would happen to the comics I've purchased? I can't save them on my hard drive. I can only read them on the comiXology app. I can't read my free Marvel digital copies, because the Marvel Comics app and the comiXology app aren't compatible, and there is no Marvel Comics app for the tablet I use  [EDIT: Thanks to /u/pursutioms for pointing this out - you can get your Marvel account linked to your comiXology account by sending them an email containing your username and email for both accounts!] . We need a single file format that can be used on multiple platforms. Turn comiXology into something like iTunes. I can buy music on iTunes, but also use it to play music that I purchased elsewhere. I think a model like that would really help to move digital comics forward.   The other big and related issue is pricing. $2.99 or $3.99 is too much for a single digital issue, given the current model. I'm not going to pay the same price as a print item for a digital item, when I won't even have ownership of the digital item. Monkeybrain has the right pricing, for the current model: $0.99 for ~16 page comics, $1.99 for a standard sized issue. The $1.99 price makes  so  much sense. It's a fair price, and it gives the opportunity to offer sales (if I remember correctly, I think Kirkman was the first one to propose the $1.99 price, but I could be wrong * [EDIT: [found the source for that Kirkman story]( However, I'd be willing to pay more if I had ownership. I would happily pay $1.99 for a 16-page comic and $2.99 for a standard sized comic that I own. If $3.99 is considered to be too high for many print comics, there is  no way* that you can charge $3.99 for the digital version.   Fix the ownership, fix the file format/platform, and fix the pricing. If that were to happen, I would shift almost all of my purchases to digital in an instant.
The real hilarious part about this MSNBC Bieber thing is that it's not the fault of "the media" or some other conglomerate that's out to hide the truth away from your intense gaze of patriotism. You make the choice about what the media reports. Yes, you, citizen. I do as well. Whenever we click on the headline of the girl with the amazing rack, the guy with the washboard abs, the empty minded story about whatever pop culture phenomenon is happening at the moment... we're telling the media what we want to see. When you're changing channels and a celebrity you think is hot causes you to linger for just a moment longer, you're impacting the needle on some small level. The sooner we learn that "the media" isn't some autonomous entity but rather the composition of our society's choices regarding the importance of one story over another, the better off we'll all be. As long as we have this red herring of some greater power telling us what to pay attention to, then we never have to take responsibility for our own silly habits regarding consumption.
i am [26/M] she is [25/f] . we are friends, i have no romantic interest in her.  she has told me, multiple times, that she has a crush on me, but i don't feel the same way.   the other day i asked if she wanted to hang out, she said she was busy and had an out of town friend over.  no problem for me, i tell her its cool.  then she just keeps texting me for the rest of the after noon about what they're doing.  she then calls me when she is on the way to the store just to say "hi".   i thought that was strange all around and told her so.  the next day she tells me she feels embarrassed and "it was obviously strange, i'm sorry, have a nice day" (this is paraphrased)   so my question is this.  after you establish you can't hang out with a friend is it weird to just keep chatting them up and eventually calling? or am i being weird?  part of me thinks a little of both, but the way she worded things makes me feel like she's trying to manipulate guilt into me. but that also could just be me too.  i just know with my guy friends, we say we can't hang out and that's the end of it.
DotA always has a lull in action after The International, no major tournaments, only team shuffle drama. So while I am burnt out on Dotes right now, I have decided to give this game a real try and see if I can enjoy playing it. If anyone is willing to give me some advice, or a high level player on OCE server wants to mentor or coach me, it would be greatly appreciated. I like innovating but also want to learn the basics quickly. If anyone wants to lend a hand or has any input, feel free to PM me or leave a comment here. Cheers
i  loved  it. hands-down the best scene in that show which made me marathon the entire thing until morning. oh and  afterwards
I'm awake now so maybe I can get some advice, although not sure if this is the best place. I've been with my gf for 6 years now, my issue doesn't stem from her but affects her.   I don't know how people manage to fit things into their lives. I have a 9-5 office job Mon-Fri and nothing but personal time after work, but I'm always too tired to do anything. And weekends always just seem to rush by.   My job isn't hard for me or exhausting. I get home, I need some alone time to recharge, then there's dinner,  then zone out a bit and watch something, then I fall asleep. If I have anything else to add to this it seems the whole day is filled up.   I also don't know why I get so tired. I didn't use to. I wake up around eight and I'm unable to stay conscious by 11.  Sometimes I enjoy having drinks with my gf and staying up late (and I can work hangover), those are great times and we then have fun,  spend meaningful time, have sex.  But I just get too tired most nights. I have a few drinks and I want to sleep. It can't be normal to be that exhausted.   And if we don't drink and stay up, I just can't even be in the mental zone for sex or even talking. If after work she wants to have a longer conversation with me it just feels like a chore and so exhausting. Its not her fault I love talking to her, but I need those drinks and special mind frame to know we are now putting focus on each other.   I don't even do much housework, we get a maid to clean and are simple with food. I gave hobbies I am happy when I put some time into but I will never put any time into cause it seems like I just don't have the time or energy for it.   Even work is becoming a chore that really bothers me and I really can't complain about my job. The idea of changing it for something else bothers me if a different job would be more time consuming or even take longer time to get to, even something that trivial is my concern. It's like  I keep wondering when work finally stops but then I expect so much from weekends and they just go by so fast and I'm waiting for some conclusion.   Keeping up any kind of correspondence with people is another chore.  Sometimes I don't even want to open a message out of fear that it will require a reply and I just don't feel like it.   Things just become a chore too easy for me. Any time I tell myself in advance that I need to get something done, even if it would be in pleasure/entertainment category like sex, watching a specific movie that someone recommended etc it becomes tedious and I just can't get to it.   Anyway I love my gf, she is amazing and not boring or tedious at all. I feel like I am really neglecting her among other things but mainly I need to sort out what the fuck is wrong with me. I can answer any additional questions in the comments.
I'm the middle child of five girls. When I was in middle school, I was reading to my two younger sisters in my bedroom. I happened to glance up at my door to see a blonde girl poking her head around the frame. I automatically assumed this was my second oldest sister because she was blonde and we shared the bedroom at the time. I looked back down to the book in my hands briefly and when I looked back to the door, the girl was gone. I called out to her because I had just cleaned our room and thought she'd like to see. I got no reply and thought nothing of it.   It wasn't until a few minutes later that I comprehended how strange that had been. Not only was it unlike my sister to just peek into our bedroom and not say a word when I yelled after her, but it dawned on me that I hadn't heard her come up to the door or walk away afterwords. My house is over two centuries old so the floorboards creak with the slightest step (not ideal for sneaking out, might I add).   I decided to confront my sister, who I found downstairs at the computer. Because I was suspicious, I simply asked her if she had been upstairs recently. She told me no, that she had been cranking out an essay for the past hour. I didn't tell her what I saw and I felt slightly unsettled, but definitely not scared.   I have had moments in my house where I was actually terrified, but that was one of the very few experiences that occurred calmly.
I posted this about 7 months ago.. but it applies here as well.   I am a RN that works palliative care at the local hospital. Palliative care is where we take care of patients that have a DNR status and are made CMO (comfort measures only). I have seen a lot of gruesome things while working here. We will start off with my top one. We had a very obese lady that had bariatric surgery about a week prior. Bariatric surgery is a way to basically "shrink" the stomach so you lose weight. There are different methods but this lady had her small bowels re-routed to a newly made "stomach pouch". Now keep in mind that this new "stomach" only holds about 30ml of fluid at a time. If you try to drink more than that you can produce a "dumping syndrome". This is where the liquid just by passes everything very quickly, is not absorbed and is passed out of the patient. This alone can make a patient very sick. So it is recommended to take very small sips of liquids daily for a period of time and then work your way up to soft foods and etc. This lady, about a week after her surgery had her husband sneak McDonald's into her at the hospital. We did not notice. Unfortunately we do not have the staffing to supervise all the patients all the time, especially ones who know what the hell is going on and are "with it" (medical term :p). Now remember when I said about the stomach being able to only handle aprox 30cc at a time of LIQUID? This lady (knowing the risks b/c not only does she undergo counseling BEFORE the surgery, she has nurses, LPNs, nurses aides, that constantly remind her not to over do it during "meals") proceeds to eat not one, but TWO big macs and a large fry and wash it down with a large coke. The lady was unable to tell us what she ate b/c her stomach literally exploded. The husband told us what had happened. She was rushed back to the ER and the doctor did what he could but unfortunately it was not enough to save her. Being wheeled up from surgery she went straight into palliative care, me being her nurse. She was heavily sedated and never fully woke back up. The stench from her OPEN stomach wound was horrid! Think of walking into the shitter when someone with a bad case of the runs has just left, then add the smell of rotting garbage on top of that. I am not done. Now take that smell and add a sweet wetness to it. This is what the wound, her room, and most of the nurses station smelled like. On her stomach was a dressing, it was to be white, but from the seepage it was green/brown. Tape was to be holding it down, but again, that heavy wet smelling seepage was spread all over her stomach and was oozing out through the gauze making the dressing loose. Being my patient, guess whose job it was to change the dressing?? Ding Ding Correct for 1 point! It was me!! I put on a gown, gloves and mask, b/c god only knew wtf I was going to get into. Upon lifting the dressing I was face to face with a open midline incision. (Midline incision = open from stem to sturn) Her whole abdomen just sliced open, leaving everying open to air. Whatever the hell I was looking at was just covered in this dark green slime. I do not use that term "slime" loosely. Having wash cloths and towels to clean this up was not cutting it. Everytime I put any type of pressure on her abdomen more green slime would inevitably push its way out. Picture the river of slime under the city of New York in Ghostbusters only with smell-a-vision. It was dripping off of the bed, onto the floor, splattering onto my shoes., but I persisted. Finally getting cleaned up what I could, getting the wound redressed and knowing that I was going to have to reinforce it a couple more times during my shift with more gauze and padding. for those who work in the healthcare field, no this was not a sterile procedure due to the fact that the doctor had given her, at the most, 24hrs to live I would go back in periodically during my shift to check on her, do mouth care (keeping the patients mouth moist and clean), suctioning her for LARGE amount of that now infamous green slime. About an hour before the end of my shift, now keep in mind that the entire time this woman has been sedated on massive amounts of pain killers and other meds to keep her out of pain and from waking up) I walk back into her room knowing I was going to have to suction her again and even possibly tear the dressing down and re-dress it b/c how much drainage there was. The patient was deceased. I could tell b/c during her apparent "death throws" the had somehow managed to turn her self on her side with her one arm draped over the bed rail. Her gown hid the open wound on her abdomen but it was soaked. Her bandaged had fallen off and was laying on the floor in a puddle of green slime. Also in that puddle was (I shit you not) most of her intestines and other various pieces of her. We had to do post mortem care, and yes again, it being night shift we have no aides to help, I get the job of cleaning this up. First thing I have to do is heft this lady onto her back, not an easy task, she weighed above 500lbs. I then had to PICK UP HER INTESTINES and place them back in her body!! The smell was at its peak. I do not know how I am not retching at this point. I know I have a strong stomach for smells and gore, but this is unbelievable!! I again clean her up, redress the wound and can finally call in the cleaning service and then her family. And that is my most gruesome story, although I have others.
Supporting real carriers is expensive as hell and most countries would rather let the US, who is for the time being, more than willing to foot the bill instead of basically doubling their naval budget to support one. The British are a special case because they learned that getting rid of all of their fleet carriers was a bad idea and relying on their smaller flat tops doesn't quite cut it, especially of Argentina decides it wants the Falklands again. Selling them a decommissioned Nimitz or saving them a Kitty Hawk or Foresstal class if nuclear wasn't popular could have totally worked and it being the UK we're talking about the US gov might have actually been OK with it. Thing is its more complicated than that. First off the Brits, while rusty, do know how to make a carrier. Most of the innovations required to make fleet and super carriers possible were thought up not by the USN but RN. Second the Brits still have a big and healthy ship building industry and a carrier isn't beyond their means by any stretch. Third the Brits have a lot of pride for their navy, and its well earned. The Royal Navy isn't the kind to buy other's designs second hand unless something like WW2 happens and they just need more ships yesterday. And lastly such an undertaking is extremely lucrative and it would do more for the British economy to have someone local build a new carrier instead of refurbish an old one and there likely was a lot of political lobbying to do just that. The only other allies we would even consider selling such a powerful weapon to either aren't allowed to have one such as Germany or Japan or don't want one like Canada.
I have no idea what to make of it, but I get turned on when my girlfriend pees. We have a long distance relationship and we've done things on skype and such but a couple times while we've been on skype she was on her ipad and she decided to take me with her while she peed. She didn't show me anything but I don't know why I got extremely turned on while she was peeing for some reason, and we were just talking and having a normal conversation lol.   This also isn't just when she is peeing, like any time she talks about her peeing or when she tells me that she has to pee or something I get turned on. I remember her telling me that if someone tickles her too much it makes her pee and that even turned me on. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY. This is pretty embarrassing lol.   Should I tell her? We haven't had sex yet (I'm still a virgin btw and she isn't) but we've talked about all the different sexual things we want to try. She's told me about things that she's kind of embarrassed about and she told me that I could tell her anything and she wouldn't judge me. We've both told each other about some of our fantasies and we both did MojoUpgrade (with advanced questions too). She answered no to golden showers btw and I did too, I wouldn't want to do golden showers I just would want to be around while she pees. :s if that makes any sense.   Does anyone have experience with anything like this? Either you telling your SO or them telling you? How did you/he/she react? Also I'm new to reddit so sorry if this is the wrong place to be posting this.
My wife (of 3 years) and my brother have been best friends since they were 12. They spent a lot of time together in their teenage years, and they eventually left for the same college and shared a flat together. As far as my parents were concerned she was another daughter of the family. I was never close with her during those early years since I was older but in early 20s we started dating and things worked great, and marriage came too.   My wife has always been very welcome in our family. My parents always loved her and it only got better after our marriage. My brother was always close with her and they remained best friends after marriage as well. To me this was great because my wife has a great friend in her life that she can rely on and it's my brother who I trust more than anyone else in the world.   So my brother has been daring this girl for 6 months now. She's a nice and lovely girl and everything seemed fine. But today she came to me and told me that the relationship between my wife and brother freaks her out. I asked her to explain and she went onto these examples of the things that she's seen that she thought were unacceptable, and I found none of them to be unacceptable. Like she says my brother once said to my wife to "move her ass" and she thinks that's pushing boundaries. I mean that's really nothing. I explained that I don't find these things problematic at all.   I asked if she knows their history which she said yeah but she says that the history is full of inappropriate things as well. I asked for examples and she once again went on about things that were not inappropriate in any way. The worst thing that she said was a picture of my wife and brother where my wife was topless which she saw by accident (maybe accident is translation for sneaking into my brother's computer, I don't know). I told her that I probably took that picture. Other things were like oh they went on that trip together or they looked close in that picture or things like that.   I asked if she thinks they're sleeping together? She said no. I told her that it's settled then but she didn't seem convinced. I asked if she has talked to my brother about any of it which she said no since she tried to bring it up but my brother was like "she's my sister it's really between us". I suggested that she should listen to him but she kept saying that she's very uncomfortable. She eventually asked me to tell my wife to stay away from my brother as much as possible. I told her that it's not going to happen but she kept insisting and just ended the conversation by saying "please think about it".   What should I do? Give my wife and brother the heads up or ignore her and let her deal with this herself?
1984, on a bridge over the Intercoastal Waterway, in Indian River County, FL.  I was driving and I decided my friends and I should spray paint some grafitti on the bridge.  We were drunk.  We had a box filled with spray paint cans and liquor in the back seat of my dad's car.  A sheriff pulls up behind my car, his lights are on.  He asks us what we are doing, so we tell him spray painting.  He asked what was in the box visible on the back floorboard, and we tell him spray paint and liquor.  He starts collecting our names,but one name gives him pause.  Turns out its the son of a mayor of a town in the county.  Another name gives him pause, its the son of a very prominent lawyer in the town.  The lawyer just brought a minor league ball team to play nearby in a 65 million dollar land deal that brought a new town into being.  That's how its done in Florida now, but it was a new situation and in all the papers in 1984.  I am nobody.  The cop told us to be careful, and drove away.
My kid is decent, is very smart and has a clean room, enjoys gaming and does a lot of research on the PC and also builds computers. and runs a YouTube channel that makes around 50$ a month from adrevenue, He gets very bad grades, does not usually try and says its boring, he is smart and knows a lot but you still need a high school education. He does take some prescriptions, he takes antidepressants for depression which is now all worked out(Not sure how long your even supposed to take that) and 40mg of Adderall a day for his ADHD which sometimes he does not take it because he is not doing anything important that day.   I was in his room and looked in the entertainment center drawer(I know, should not do this. Honestly i just was walking around the house and had a curiosity). I open the drawer and see around 200 of these pill strips, its called Modalert 200, you can look it up on images. the majority was those and some was this Artvigil-150. Now i did a lot of research and read some subreddits about it and it appears to be not for abusing drugs as i know he would not do that because he knows a ton about medicine and knows how all his medications effect his neurotransmitters and such, he is usually tired all the time even though he sleeps 8-10 hours. so i'm not sure. What do you guys think?
First off, I don't want you guys to give me money. I just want advice.   I currently owe my University about $1800 (and will owe more once the next semester starts). I used to owe ~$2500, but I appealed for more aid and they awarded me another ~$600 per semester.   I might get more aid once my parents get their tax forms in, it took them for-fucking-ever.   My parents both have horrible credit, and can't cosign loans for me. I'm responsible for paying for my own college education.   I, as far as I am aware, have no line of credit. I've never been on an apartment lease, I don't own any credit cards (just debit cards that I can use as debit or credit cards, but I doubt that's build up anything substantial)   The problem is even if they do award aid, I'll have a hard time paying more than $1000 out of my pocket, and even that is going to hurt me a lot.   So I ask, what can I do to fix this situation? I cant register for classes until it's fixed. Are there loans I can take out without a cosigner that understand that I'm just a student?  Are there scholarships out there that I'd actually have a shot at? (Fastweb always seemed like a joke/scam to me).   I already work a part time on top of school (15-20 hours a week), and I'm heavily involved in extracurriculars, so my time to write essays or do incredible side projects is pretty limited.   Any ideas are totally welcome.
I think the point they are making is that drawing about these things doesn't actually hurt anybody and some of it is pretty funny stuff. Some of it may be off taste, and we all have our own line we cross where it stops being funny, but maybe the artist is exploring that line?
This is RANDOM acts of pizza. I don't know how much more obvious that could be, given that it's in the title of the subreddit.   Merits of any recipient aside, it's up to the GIVER to decide who they'd like to give a pizza to. It's certainly not the place of others to impose their pizza morals of who should or should not receive because of their circumstances.
The hivemind seems to think this is awful; I disagree.  I firmly believe that bullies fully  deserve  to have their lives utterly destroyed.  However, the hivemind also thinks this is stupid, and I must reluctantly agree with that.  The odds of you getting caught are... what?  Whatever they are, they're higher than you think, even if you take that into account.  You're not a career criminal, I presume.  The odds are overwhelming that you do not know what you're doing.   Try consulting a lawyer.  Being sued feels like being punched in the gut.  Sue the parents, sue the school... even if it doesn't go anywhere, they might pay more attention.  You might, as at least one other poster noted, possibly get a restraining order.  (Edit:  judges tend to get  really  angry at people disobeying their orders.  A pissed-off judge can make someone's life  miserable. )   Keep in mind, if you  do  get caught, which you probably will, you'll end up in prison, the bully will end up scot-free, and he'll learn the lesson that he can ultimately get away with anything.  The risk here doesn't strike me as great, unless your "resources" guarantee that you are, for some reason, immune to prosecution.
lmao reminds me of the time I went camping with my friend and his dog Dusty.   so we're in the middle of the forest roasting on a camp fire so i say to my frend, "uhh I got the gram crackers, did you bring the marshmellows?" and we look over and Dusty is freaking eating the bag of marshmellows HOLE and looks over at us like "uhh did you bring my dog treats for the smores? lol" turns out my friend brought treats instead of gram crackers and we all just sat there and laughed. lmao Dusty is always a riot but thats the last time we bring him camping
Because safety and oversite are just wasted money that could be used to pay for CEO bonuses.
Alright so this weekend I was at a California State Park about 2 hours from where I live when I was pulled over for not stopping completely at a stop sign. I am absolutely 100% positive that I stopped. The intersection was completely full (4 way intersection) and I stopped and let a person from the side on my left turn left so they were in front of me (if that makes sense). Then, I went straight and was immediately pulled over.   I'm 17, completely clean driving record, had 2 other people in the car with me who also witnessed this. I freaked out and did not say this to the police officer. He asked "why I didn't stop" and I told him "I didn't realize I hadn't, I'm pretty sure I did" and we left it at that.   This ticket is literally a week's worth of pay, I am paying for college and already have loans. I depend on this money. At this point I don't know what to do since it's my word against the cop's. Going to court will be a large financial investment because I will need to take the day off of work and drive 2 hours each way. I don't want to do that unless I have a reasonable chance of getting off. Paying for the ticket, a day's lost wages, and 4 hours worth of gas would be really, really difficult. I stopped and took pictures of the intersection but have no evidence other than the 2 witnesses (and I have no idea if they would even have any use).
I met a girl my age (18) online who was in to many of the same things I was and we started chatting online.  I live in Canada and she lives in England so there's a five hour time difference.  We've spoken online through chat only for about six months now and a week ago we decided to Skype voice call one each other.  Everything was completely innocent and we had a good time.  The only problem was that she would only skype once her parents went to bed so that meant that our conversations lasted until about 4am her time.   So last night everything was going good and then I decided to show her my house and a couple of places near where I live that are pretty cool.  After that she decided to show me her house and then she pointed out the windows for her bedroom and the window for her living room which was where she currently was.  So a few minutes pass by and all of sudden she kinda freaks and says her mom is coming downstairs and muted the conversation.   When she came back on she was telling me how her mom was worried for her, thinking that I was some creepy old man trying to find out where she lived.  My friend was clearly tired and not thinking clearly because she got all nervous thinking that I might be some creepy guy.  We had added each other on Facebook before, and we've seen photos of each other.  Anyway I ended up taking a picture of myself with the call in the picture and sent it to her.   She kinda calmed down but was still a little weird.  About two minutes later she said that she was going to go to bed.  I went to bed, concerned about what would happen between us.  The next day she didn't message me at any of the usual times that we message each other.  I sent her an apology but nothing back yet.  It's been nearly twenty hours since we spoke and we always speak at least once every day.  I may have fucked up.
I wake up one morning to a particularly and the air was really dry. In a mad dash, I run to the kitchen . In the scramble to get ready for class, I grab an old loaf of bread from the top of the refrigeration. In the process, a huge could of dust start to come at my like the locusts of the plague. And with that, I sneezed and the nose started to bleed like the Niagara Falls. I hastily run the my room to grab tissues and try to clog my nostril.   I while I wait for the bleed to finish, I attempt to brush my teeth. If you ever tried to brush your teeth with a tissue hanging out of your nose, you know it's almost impossible to not get it wet. By the time I  finish, I noticed that my tissue is wet and pulled out the tissue to get a fresh dry tissue. After pulling it out, a torrent of blood that was clogged by the tissue came rushing out of my nose and into the sink. The wetness of the tissue actually came from the blood leaking through the tissue.   Fustrated because I had class in ten minutes and I still had to walk there, I shove another tissue up in that nose and go on reddit to wait it out. As soon I hit the moment where I need to start walking to class and pull out the tissue, it cause an itch inside my nose and any attempt to suppress is gone as i sneeze which caused any clotting inside my nose to fly out and well as the liquid that has been building and land all over the computer. Now, I have blood dripping from my nose and a bloody mess on my computer. Class has started by this point and I am in a frantic rush to clean up the mess and stop the bleeding now.   I grab some toilet paper and attempt to clean the keyboard and screen, but I run out of tissues. I run to the kitchen for some paper towels where an empty roll laid.   Long story short, I had to sit on my chair trying to clean the mess with not so absorbent toilet paper with one hand, and pinching my nose with the other. It ended up to be a 30 minute nosebleed and when I got to class, my nose decided the sneeze again which caused the blood to flow out again, and I might as well left class that day because I spent the lecture in the bathroom.
Ok time to swap midget stories.   Ok so I was working in a convenience store like 6 or so years back and it was rather busy.  It was just a little mom and pop operation and there were only 2 registers so 2 lines had formed.   I'm working the left register and my coworker and friend Jane is helping people on the right register.  While we were furiously trying to reduce the amount of customers waiting we were still taking orders for the kitchen.  One of those orders was for a large pepperoni pizza for one of our regulars who everyone knew.  This detail seems largely unimportant at this time as it did to us.   About 5 to 10 minutes pass and we're still taking customers.  I look over at Jane's line.  At the end of her line is a male midget.  You have to understand I'd never seen a midget in person.  I probably felt like Russel Brand when he got to meet an elephant while hanging out with Britney Spears (go watch his comedy show on Netflix if you need context).   There is one detail that's pretty interesting though.  My friend Jane... well let's just say she had a problem with midgets.  Not like one of those situations where she looks down on them... no no she was deathly terrified of midgets and clowns.  Apparently when she was a child a midget clown scared the ever living shit out of her and she's been afraid ever since.   I look over at Jane and she's looking at me.  Her eyes are wide and she looks like she's shaking a little.  She knows that I know that she's deathly afraid of midgets.  I look at the midget guy... I look at her... I shrug my shoulders in an effort to convey "What do you want me to do?  Call out the midget guy in the middle of the store?".  I see acceptance and resolve come over her and she proceeds like it's not a problem (I'll admit I was little impressed with that).  The midget dude orders a large pepperoni pizza and leaves.  He comes back 15 mins later and we give him the pizza and he goes on his way.   Now in walks Tim the regular customer I mentioned earlier who had ordered a large pepperoni pizza.  He comes up to the counter and asks for it.  We ask the kitchen for the pizza.  The kitchen tells us that we do not have his pepperoni pizza.  After much confusion and searching around we try to find out why there was a mix up.  Eventually we find the slip for a pepperoni pizza... the one the midget had ordered.  Jane had dropped it by accident beside the register and it had never reached the kitchen.  We had given Tim's pizza away to a midget.   Now an opportunity to even have a conversation about a midget would be a rarity where I live so of course I volunteered to tell him.  I walk up to Tim and I give him the I'm about to tell you your wife died on the surgery table look.   "Look... I don't know how to tell you this............ but we gave your pizza to a midget."   His look went from confusion to WTF in about a second.  You ever see someone in such a state of confusion that they say something with their entire head?  He looks at me and snaps his head from right to left while at the same time saying "Wwwwwwwwwhat?" You could tell the midget excuse was unexpected.   I calmly explain the situation to him and we get a good chuckle.  I think we discounted his pizza or something.  He leaves with his pizza and things return to normal.   Now for the rest of his life he can tell people about the time the convenience store gave away his pizza to a midget.
No way man, I love being me. Sure, I wish I was way hotter, way smarter, way - whatever, but I'm not. These are the cards I was dealt. Being me might not be awesome going by other people's standards, but I can't think of anything worse than being fake. I would need quite a bit of plastic surgery to be "hot" (if plastic surgery could even solve that problem in my case) and seeing my bank account drained and a completely different person in the mirror would fill me full of shame and regret.
A "point" is a general term, with more than one mathematical formalization. Technically, the classical "point" is from euclidean geometry, but it is common to informally speak of any element in some mathematical space as a "point", especially if we can visualize the space. For example you can talk about some point in a metric space, or some point on a manifold. It's a relatively loose concept.   A vector, in contrast, is a very specific term which is used in a precise mathematical context - that of vector spaces. Vector spaces obey a very specific set of axioms: Vectors can be added, addition distributes over multiplication by a scalar, and so on and so on. Vector spaces arise in all sorts of places in mathematics. Some intuitive and easy to visualize, others not so much.   It so happens that the "canonical" vector spaces, the ones that naturally spring to mind, are euclidean spaces such as R^3 , where all the elements are both vectors and can be easily conceived as "points" (indeed, they formally are called that in the context of geometry). But some vector spaces deal with very different concepts than the geometry that we are used to, and calling the elements in them 'points' is weird and runs counter to intuition -- in some vector spaces the elements are polynomials, would you call a polynomial a "point"? Conversely (and much more markedly), in many,  many  mathematical contexts where you can intuitively speak of "points", the points are not vectors and there are no vectors anywhere to be found at all, unless you explicitly construct them - e.g. in point-set topology.
Hello step parents!   So I'm recently discovering that my parenting style varies IMMENSELY depending on if their dad is around or not (at work or something). Does anyone else see this in themselves?   I have two stepsons ages 9 & 11. My husband and i have been married for 5 months, but living together for a year. We all live happily together. Their dad is typically waaayyy more relaxed in parenting than I am. I'm usually a bit more strict in ways like cleaning up after themselves, how much video game time they get, etc. Their dad, when it comes to punishment, is very laid back, but the kids are great! They're easy going, don't complain too much and do what they're supposed to for the most part. So I really let my husband do most of the discipline since he's the father and it just works better that way for us. I will usually chime in with "hey, don't forget to pick up after yourself" or "make sure your homework is put away before you play video games".   I find that when it's just me and the boys, I'm way less strict and more easy going than when their father is around. If they forget to clean their plate, I'll do it or if one of them doesn't listen when I say something, I'll kind of let it go. I kind of just let them do what they want (within reason) without much input. I'm certainly not like this when dad is around. I must note that the kids are good about getting ready for school on time and such without being told. The youngest one however, is a scatterbrain and has to be reminded A LOT to do things.   Usually, I'm a stickler for consistency when it comes to parenting, but I find I'm less so with their dad not being present. I'm not sure if it's the desire for them to like me, who knows. We have a good relationship. The boys come to me equally with things as they do with their father. We all feel comfortable around each other and it all seems to work. I'm just not sure why I'm so different when their dad is not around. Is anyone else like this?
So today my girlfriend is moving out and into an apartment across town. We've lived together for 2 1/2 years, and our relationship was over 3 yrs. We moved across the country together last August for me to attend a graduate program. A month ago she said she needed space to discover her own life. I was always careful to not be too smothering or invasive. She has a really strong sense of independence and felt like it was getting compromised. She said she's really unsure of who she has become and felt like she was just following my life's track. Our breakup was emotional but not vitriolic or destructive to our core friendship (we've been friends for 10 yrs). It's really hard for me to deal with this, and we were on track to spend our lives together (we're registered domestic partners). She's also said that she doesn't want to completely close the door on our relationship and that if she moves out and feels like she's made a mistake, she's open to getting back together if I still am. I really dug our energy together and it was so nice sharing everything with someone on the same wavelength. I don't have any interest in the things that I used to, watching movies, deep talking, even sex. I know that this is the beginning of deep depression (I am already a depressive type person). How do I beat this? Also, is it foolish to believe that things might go back to how they were if she realizes that a life with me was the correct path for her?
Ok so a little background. I didn't have much sexual action in highschool. I didn't date much but any girl I did was never interested in oral or vaginal penetration. Because of that, I have never cum to a girl.   I am 19 and lost my virginity about 4 months ago and in that time I have still never cum. I've had sex multiple times sober, drunk, high, with a condom, without a condom yet have never cum. The first time I lost it, I had sex four different times in four hours yet never officially finished. example: Last night I had sex with a girl. I wore a condom and gave her a good ride but didn't end up coming. she then gave me oral in hopes I would finish but after about 10 minutes, she gave up. about an hour later I had sex again in hopes that I could get the credits rolling but the ending never came and eventually she said it was getting uncomfortable so we stopped. I went home that night and jerked off and came in 5 minutes.  my question is, what am I doing wrong??   I have looked up some solutions. Before the event I just recounted, I had only masterbated twice in the week before, the last time being 2 days before our meet up.  This is a throwaway account but I have read so many of your threads where you are really helpful to anyone looking for advice. Any advice would be really beneficial as I'm becoming less and less interested in sex because I never get to orgasm which makes it a lot less enjoyable.  what should I do r/sex?
I worked at a marina, on the gas dock.  Basically a gas station for small boats, nothing larger than 55 feet ever came in.  Anyway, most boats have toilets on board and a shit holding tank.  One of my duties as a dock boy was to climb on board and suck all the human waste out of the boat with a giant orange vaccuum hose. Aside from that it was a fun summer job, and I got a really nice tan out of working there.
I only REALLY noticed once she was climbing into her cage and left a trail of blood behind. It's covering half her tail. I know rats don't get periods. I just had my first rat die last Sunday. I can't handle another one dying.   I live in Worcester county in Massachusetts. I'm only 17, and I don't have a job. I know how expensive treatment can be. I tried convincing my mom to hook my other rat up with a vet (huge mammary tumor), and she just told me it isn't worth it. Just for hahas, is there any specific doctor to go to at Tufts? Or anywhere else around here? Though I don't suppose $200 is going to get me anywhere, is it?
I'm Canadian, so I don't know the full story, but most likely yes, a business man did just start the team.   American football in the late 19th & 20th centuries was entirely dominated by college teams. In fact, when professional teams started to pop up in the early 20th century, they were largely viewed as a place for washed-up former college stars to go make a quick buck. They were looked upon almost as poorly as one would look upon a stripper (i.e. selling your abilities for a quick buck). Business men knew the public loved football but it took a long time before professional football became widely accepted and loved like it is today.   The early days of professional football were characterized by tons of shady business dealings, with teams constantly being sold and relocated as eager businessmen chased profits. Honestly, if you look at the lineage of some American football teams, it's crazy. Take the Pittsburgh Steelers for example (one of the oldest and well-established teams in the league). Here's what they went through since being founded (source: Wikipedia):   Pittsburgh Pirates (1933–1939)   Pittsburgh Steelers (1940–1942)   Phil-Pitt "Steagles" (1943)   Card-Pitt (1944)   Pittsburgh Steelers (1945–present)   And that's a tame example.   So yeah, I can understand your confusion, as it's nothing like British football. For one, there's no concept of relegation, so when teams start to suck, they are still forced to compete with the big boys. They continue to suck, and start to lose money until eventually, moving seems like a viable option (this happens less nowadays due to the salary cap - but let's not get into that now).
English is not my first language, so it’s possible I’ll make some mistakes.   As the title says, I was ghosted by a friend. We used to talk daily (or almost daily) and suddenly he stopped replying at my messages. (I sent him some pics and I asked him how is he).   I reread our last conversation and it was perfectly normal and he was also active on social media so he saw that I wrote him. Honestly I don’t know what happened, I wanted to send him a message saying “Hey! Is everything alright?” but I think this will be annoying so I don’t have any other option than move on.   While I understand some people just lose touch, when someone suddenly stops replying clearly something happened.   My question is: how can I avoid this in future? To be fair, I prefer people just be direct to me and say if they don’t want to talk to me anymore. I will always appreciate the truth even if it’s not that pretty.
So I finally purchased GTA V on PC (already had it on PS3). It arrived today so that was exciting...NOT. I bought the disc version because I thought the install would be faster and I like box art, big mistake.   I install disc 1 and everything goes smooth...No problems, it asks for Disc 2 and I put it in and it starts installing. This is easy I thought, I thought.   Half way through Disc 2 it decided there's some error so I google the error and people are saying it's from the poor packaging and mentioning scratches. So I take Disc 2 out and have a look under my ultra bright superman lights, lo and behold there is this minor deep looking donut scratch and a bunch of cat ass looking scratches. THANKS ROCKSTAR. So after purchasing a physical copy I'm now forced to download it using the code. I should've just bought the online key.   I'm wondering if I put Disc 2 into one of those CD fixer machine things will it work? Oh well at least I can download it.   Please hurry up. I'm now part of the GTA V 60gb download struggle group, am I cool yet?
I found this lighter lying around the house. It is the cheapest you can get, there's not a brand on it. Well anyways, it extremely hard to spark. I removed two child-proof metal thingys, but it is still so hard to turn the wheel. My only way to make it spark is by using a quarter and running it on the wheel and my thumb on the gas button. As you can see this is a predicament because I need to use  both  hands also its a  pain in the ass
The protests in Wisconsin are about the fact the new Governor of Wisconsin (sponsored by the Koch brothers), gave sweeping tax cuts to the rich and then claimed the deficit from that required him to pass laws removing the right of unions to collectively bargain for health care, as well as bargaining for wage increases over the amount of inflation without a public referendum.   So a state employee in Wisconsin can be in a union, but said union cannot bargain the state for anything.
First of all a litte bit of background of my gaming group:   They're all CCG players or former ones, they started getting into boardgames when I brought at our weekly wednesday meetup (started as a RPG night) my newly bought copy of Settlers of Catan one year ago. We loved that game and played it a lot. After few months I started getting into the boardgame world and begun collecting.   Now here's my problem, it seems like in my group everybody is still stuck at those "gateway" games. SoC, TTR, Dominion are the most requested, if I bring different games they get snobbed by the majority for the old classic ones. So last week I bought an imported copy of Thunderstone Advance (not distributed in my language) as a "next step" to the Dominion experience. But while playing I noticed that some of my friends cannot grasp the logic in the game, mechanics more complex than take actions->buy cards of dominion, the fact that there are more than 2 choices to make during your tourn overwhelm them.   They're not stupid, as I mentioned they're CCG players and they can play complex decks of cards properly building combos and overthinking their opponent, but maybe it's too early for the "next step"?
I felt like a dumbass after I rushed into a CQB area and got shot in the hand covering my mouth. Why? My eyepro was over my forehead. As I said, my hand was covering my mouth, and ALL the shots landed on my hand. Boy, was I lucky.
So we just started a new campaign. there are 3 players a druid (myself), a rogue, and a cleric. Our characters have had no interactions with each other really until we are all forced into battle some invading goblins and an ogre. While fighting the ogre my character is rendered unconscious due to a javelin through the chest. and while I am out the ogre crits my animal companion (whom is the closest thing my character had to parents) and obliterates it to kingdom come. because my character was a 'dick' and did not care to assist the rogue with cutting off the heads of the goblins (they came first then the ogre) and impale them on sticks [funny half-ling cannot cut off a head]. He decides to skin my dog and also eat it in the morning for breakfast -  as well as attempted to get the innkeeper to feed me some my dog as well. also peeing on my boot and stealing all 5 pieces of my gold.   The cleric cured light wounds on me to revive me.   right now all I know i smell pee, and I am missing gold I naturally am suspicious of the rogue. So I planning on speaking with the cleric in order to find out what happened to my money and my dog. he also did things that I know how like him yelling to me "I WILL CONSUME EVERYTHING YOU LOVE" to me.   the rogue said that I should be happy with what he did with the dog as nothing was wasted [METAGAME]. but I am thinking that it is more of a personal thing as how close my companion and myself were. both him and I are Chaotic neutral.   I am planning on doing something drastic to him as a physical reminder not to mess with me - I care not for how the hell we are actually supposed to play together(I am going to leave him alive), as much as I do the actual role-playing and proper reactions (a lot more entertaining this way). Besides thats the DM's problem! :) but I will throw him a bone and offer my services to the cleric for the life saving rescue.   Anyways - I guess I'm here to see if I shouldn't mind so much about him skinning and eating my dog or if I should - I really feel like I should, but he does have a point. And to see if reddit has any good ideas on how to move forward with with problem.   [we streamed it on twitch in case you want to experience as we did - last hour of it should be the summary of it really...](   <
I am a 25F grad student who would wants to start dating but hasn't found any success (yet!). My main strategy has been to get involved in events that I enjoy and talking to people while there. I'm concerned about the safety of online dating so I am avoiding that avenue.   It's been six months now, and I'm starting to wonder if a bigger issue is at play. I'm not unattractive, but I am fairly shy and my conservative lifestyle and hobbies may seem boring to some. I enjoy reading and going to libraries, playing conventional card/board games (think Scrabble, Bridge, and Hearts), going on walks, writing letters, and cooking. I do not drink alcohol and avoid loud events. I have a small circle of friends and my cohort of classmates that I spend time with. I'm not witty or funny, but I do think I'm kindhearted and thoughtful.   I previously dated a boy in high school, but we never did anything beyond a few dates and hold hands. If it helps, I'm not religious.   Should I revise my strategy? Pick up new interests? Focus on improving my appearance? Part of me feels that any changes would be disingenuous. I'm not opposed to asking a guy out if I like him, but I haven't clicked with anyone yet. I also fear I might 'miss the train' if I don't figure out how to date and have adult relationships soon.   Examples of events I attend include: fitness classes, book readings, game meetups, and outdoor markets. I'm trying to stick with free events in light of my small student stipend.
This isn't really a "trend", anime is a medium and there are so many anime and genres out there that you can't really put something this vague as a blanket trend.   As for an actually "answer", the best I can think of is the fact that most anime are based on ongoing sources such as manga and Light Novels, and since they are ongoing the various romantic paths haven't yet concluded. However, again, this only applies to ongoing series, there are plenty of conclusive series where people actually get together. Hell that even happens in on-going ones! Again, you can't just call it a trend, but
Original Post](   Final update, if anyone is interested. There was a second update, but I deleted it. Why? … I was embarrassed. Every ounce of crazy in my being exploded into a ridiculous, shit-fest of a post that I would rather forget about.   After about twenty comments pointing out my obvious ridiculousness, I said ‘fuck it’ and told him he needed to make a serious change. When he didn’t understand what this meant, I gave him the ultimatum. He could quit drinking and we could work our shit out together, or I was gone forever.   He chose drinking.   I even decided to wait and give him some time to realise the choice he had made. We had several stupid fights where he just continued to back up his argument, and try to place blame on me. He doesn’t think he has a drinking problem, and thinks it’s completely unreasonable of me to expect him to never drink again. And maybe it is. But I’m not willing to spend my life like that, so that’s all that matters, really.   I have actually been really shocked at how he has turned on me. I am now the evil, heartless bitch who has left him (but that he loves and still wants back…?), even though he has told his friends it was ‘mutual’. I did really well at not responding to it… Until I responded to it. Now we’re not on particularly good terms, but I don’t think we would have been anyway. Oh well.   So, now I have the joy of rebuilding my life. I think it’s going to be a pretty hard road ahead. The no-friends thing has already become really apparent. When I feel up to it, I’m going to try a swing dancing class. Always wanted to do it, and it seems like it might be a good way to meet people. Who knows? I'm also going get my ass back in the gym to start lifting again, and eat properly. I’m going to take some time to try and learn to be happy on my own before I jump into something new.   As for the land, we’re going to continue to pay it off together until the houses around it are built, then sell, which should take about a year. We should at least be able to make some money this way, rather than lose a lot. I will look at getting something drawn up by a lawyer this week to put that agreement in writing. I don’t really have any other options, so all I can really do it hope it works out. I think it will be ok.   Long-term, I'm going to spend the next year saving my ass off. When I finish uni this time next year, I will go on a massive trip around the world. Then come back to sell the land, which will hopefully provide me with the majority of a deposit for my own place. It won't be the beautiful, new, perfect house I had designed for my future family, but it will be mine. Then I can look at jumping into a new career. In a perfect world...   Thanks again, everyone. You really did help. Every time I have doubted myself, I have gone back and read all of your replies. Thank you. You have given me the chance to hopefully, one day, find what I’m looking for.
You forget something. Every little ounce of effort spent in an economy of scale that is merely a preventative measure is one that can't be spent constructively. Trust is by definition a method by which one can allow an efficient to grow more through the removal of protective methods. It is in the nature of growth, (a necessity for survival), to apply certain trusts for the sake of efficiency. Therefore, one cannot be guarded and expect to simultaneously succeed outside of guarding.
Hey guys. Firstly, please excuse my English, I am not a native English speaker.   I have two questions for those in here who know about depression treatment by medication - or whatnot.   In short, I have been depressed for about 2-3 years, had some anxiety episodes, some panic attacks, the whole package. It has been debilitating and horrible. No one in my social environment know about this and I didn't even seek professional help. I simply deal with it by myself, as much as I can.   I know I should have looked for a treatment but I hesitated because I was being afraid of two things:     I fear the perspective that my good mood will become dependent of drugs for my entire life. I suspect (I know, I don't have any proof, just a hunch) that these pills come with a price. So, I have preferred to just try to carry this burden instead of risking to make it bigger later on and rely on pills and more pills to dodge it.     I am a writer, this is what I do for living. Writing is my ultimate love and passion. Without it, my life is worth nothing. And in my job I rely on bold imagination, vividness, mental energy, endurance, inspiration - and I fear that by taking antidepressants I could cripple my mind out of all these important traits. They are so important for me, that I prefer to have a horrible inner life full of panic attacks and depression than lose my writing skills. I don't want to get numb. I want to feel my life either fully or at all, no matter how hard and painful would be the former.       Nevertheless, I've heard they devised new drugs which doesn't stripe the patient from their mental vivacity. Is it true? I know, I should consult a therapist but I am afraid the guy won't care about my little writing drama and keep prescribing me numbing stuff - or pills which will become a must for my good mood.   As a side note, I use to meditate regularly and meditation is my only friend and relief against this hell. But I feel I need more than this.   Thank you very much and please, if you can provide an answer, do it, because I am desperately looking for it. (or, is there any other sub to address this topic to?)
Two things here that I hope are relevant/insightful.   First, as has been previously mentioned here, financial engineering is very specific to options, derivatives, and fixed income pricing so it's very math heavy (continuous time finance).  I just took a look at the CMU MBA tracks and it looks like my MBA track at another school is very similar to the Investment Strategy track.  It still requires a lot of math and Matlab programming, but lectures are based around discrete versus continuous time, with appendices available for the more quantitatively inclined student. But it's still a lot of work - expect to put in 20-25 hours a week  each  in at least 4 or 5 courses in that track.  Do Investment Strategy if you want to manage money/work at a hedge fund.  The nice thing is that it's an MBA program, not an MFE, so there are always jobs in consulting, general management, etc. you can fall back on if things don't work out as you had hoped.   Second, I also have an academic and professional background in accounting/finance at a company.  Over the past two years I have learned a ton but my opportunities for employment are severely limited because I just don't have the experience. I have even had the opportunity for (very brief) one-on-one conversations with guys like Ken Griffin and Cliff Asness and I always ask them the same thing: I know Matlab, I've taken so-and-so's courses, and I've done my own research based on papers published in the Journal of Finance - what do I need to do to get a job at hedge fund if I've never worked in the industry? And the answer is always, we look for experience, a PhD from a top university, or outstanding academics (more or less meaning a personal recommendation from a rockstar professor) if you want to be hired at a level where you are not hitting the reset button on your salary/career. Just going through the motions isn't enough - it's easy to get an A average in undergrad if you put forth some amount of effort, but when you hit a top MBA program graded on a curve, you are competing against everyone else who had a 3.9 GPA in undergrad.  Expect to work. A lot. And not have a life outside of school/networking.  After committing 40 hours a week for the past 2 years, in addition to a full-time job, my best hope is to find a, potentially unpaid, internship at a hedge fund if I want to go into the industry.
Hi everyone,   I've been wanting to learn a bit of the Assyrian/Chaldean languages spoken today. I know there are different languages or dialects, so I guess I'm most interested in one of the ones spoken in Iraq.   I speak Hebrew and can get by pretty well in Lebanese and Iraqi Arabic. I also have a tiny bit of experience with Jewish Aramaic and the Syriac of Lebanon, but not enough to make anything out of it. The point I'm trying to make is that I think I have a fairly decent base to learn from.   The problem is that I literally can't find any decent resources. I've seen those "learn Assyrian" sites, and I could understand literally everything on it with zero effort because it's very, very basic - like explanations of how the language works and some words which are almost identical to the Hebrew or Arabic words. I do live in a city with a large Assyrian/Chaldean population, and I also have a Chaldean teacher who is very passionate about her culture and heritage but isn't really equipped to teach the language. I've listened to some songs and understood bits and pieces, but I'd like to know a bit more.   Does anybody know of any books or anything?
There has been a lot of articles recently dealing with the fact that girls are experiencing more bullying in schools, and that cliques are forming at a younger age.   Now, I agree with the fact that girls are being sexualized and put into groups at younger ages, and it probably has an influence on what kind of people they will grow up to be.   But as far as girls being bullied more? I don't feel like this is anything new. Think about it, its not special. If a boy ever brought a doll to school, you bet your tits he'd get his ass beat. The reason there are more instances of girls getting made fun of for having "boyish" things/clothes, is because its becoming more acceptable in the household to allow them to discover their interests despite gender. And these girls are bringing it to school, because they've been taught it is okay at home. Ten years ago, girls were always told that they were to play with dolls, and the cars were for their brothers. That was how it was, and that was how they grew up.   Now, I'm not saying that we should all make sure our girls wear frilly dresses and play Barbie (Lord knows I loved Legos and video games when I was a little girl. It probably explains why I get along better with guys, even to this day.) I'm just saying that the whole bullying thing is being blown out of proportion.
Hey reddit.  So my boyfriend was pretty heavy when we started hooking up. I'm not. Fitness junkie, vegetarian, gym rat, etc. But he really really won me over. I should mention I wasn't into fat guys before him. Actually, was into fit boys mainly, and some real lightweights.  Then I fell in love with him. And he was amazing in bed.  I guess my lifestyle wore off on him and he asked me to help plan his meals and stuff. He's lost about 55 lbs. He's still overweight. I'm really glad he's getting healthy, but, I'm not sure how to say this exactly right, I'm kinda turned on by his fat. Like, after two years of being in love and how amazing he is in the sack, I guess it is weird that he feels and looks so different now.  I'm not like suggesting I'd break up with him if he loses more. Just wondering if like there's a tactful way to mention that some flabbiness is hot to me now. Like I tell him all the time he's hot just as he is... But I think he just thinks I'm saying that. Plus he's really anti fat and hard on himself so just saying I like, like his actual flabbiness or something will not go well.   Right now it's not a giant problem but if he actually gets to the point of being a hard body (and I think he will) it might be. Sexually I mean.
Roadhog main here, looking for some advice.   Whenever I see a Tracer while my hook is on cooldown, so I  begin to do my shoot melee combo, she just boosts away, then boosts back in, throws her mirv grenade then recalls , gets a 6-man, shows off her butt and game is over.   How do I get better at this for when I get back?
Hey, so last week I adopted a six-month old kitten and a three-year old cat from a lovely rescue organization. They have both been spayed/neutered. I had done a ton of research and my apartment was ready for them when I came. I live in a studio apartment.   Ever since they arrived, I have been crying nonstop and I have been sleeping more than usual. I even slept through an appointment with a client, which is something I never do. I am not really eating well either. I have no psychological issues, and this behavior is not normal for me. I am trying to do normal activities like go to yoga and see friends, but whenever I am away from the cats I grow very nervous about whatever destruction they might be doing on my place.   The cat is pretty easygoing, but is easily egged on by the kitten who obviously has a lot of energy because she is a kitten. They love scratching on my couch, which I tried spraying with a No-Scratch spray, but have now resorted to covering with sheets to deter the scratching. This only sort of works. I put catnip on scratching posts, which they sometimes use—and move them to the scratching post whenever they scratch my couch. They ignore the cardboard scratchers, even with catnip and direction. They play on my counter tops, although I put aluminum foil on it. I know I should try double-stick tape on there as well as on my couch. I try to tire them with play before bed, but they usually wake up in the middle of the night and play very loudly. I am worried my neighbor downstairs (my superintendent) can hear them and is woken up by their playing. They slide on my hardwood floor and to gain traction, use their claws. So they are destroying the floors, and I’m worried my landlord will make me pay to replace the floors when I move out. I am still figuring out how to deal with odor control regarding the litterbox, but there are many options I can still try with that. The kitten sometimes gets poop stains wherever she sits, and she also passes a lot of gas. I was told this is normal because she is in the middle of a growth spurt. The kitten has also started chewing on wires, and I have started spraying them with bitter apple spray—which seems to help. The cat is a very picky eater, and will only eat way expensive Weruva even if I mix other food into it. Clicker training is not going particularly well.   They are cuddly, very cute, purr warmly, and follow me around like puppies. They have excellent litterbox etiquette. They also get along with one another well. They sleep with me, although whenever I want to switch sleeping positions I get nervous that I might wake one up and send one on a loud play romp in the middle of the night.   I did not think that I would be so terrible at taking care of these felines, but I am. I know I haven’t been with them for very long, but I feel like I can’t do anything with them around because I am so stressed out. I also really miss my old life where my apartment didn’t smell awful, I could sleep through the night, the state of my couch wasn’t in peril,  I didn’t have weird objects like aluminum foil everywhere, I wasn’t so worried about getting in trouble with my landlord or superintendent, didn’t have to deal with poop stains on my bed, could have people stay the night, etc.   I’m not sure if these are feelings that will pass, or if I should try to return them to the rescue organization before they get too settled? I don’t even know how I would begin that conversation, since I’d be so embarrassed and feel so defeated. I feel really overwhelmed and like I’ve made a terrible decision. I’m also extremely embarrassed for feeling this way, because they are so sweet and have been since day one. I am feeding them and cleaning their litterbox reliably. I am getting worse about playing with them, because all I want to do is stay in bed. I am neglecting a lot of my real life adult responsibilities and am barely eating. I want to emphasize that this is extremely atypical behavior for me.  I would love to hear any advice or if anyone has been in a similar situation.
I was dressed as Babydoll from Sucker Punch and I was with a few friends sitting on the ground in a side hallway eating lunch. A guy with this creepy sheep mask (maybe from the Purge or something?) came and asked if he could get a picture with me, and I was obviously fine with it so I stood up to take the picture but he stayed kneeling on his knees and pulled me down with him. He then wraps his arms all the way around my waist and rests his head on my chest, like nuzzling into me all the while wearing this creepy ass sheep mask.   So I'm just silently freaking out, and have no idea what to do, so I hold the pose while my friend takes the picture and then immediately lean away and nervously laugh as I do. He whips his head around and goes "WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?" Mind you, he has this heavy Russian accent and was crazy intense and I'm just starting to get really weirded out. I nervously laugh again, and he asks me again, and my friend immediately just says something like "Oh she just laughs randomly sometimes," and he doesn't even reply, he just gets up, adjusts his mask, and says "THE SHEEP LIKES HUGS," (being completely serious and still crazily Intense) then lets out this bleating sound, and walks away. I was jumpy for like a half hour after and my friends would bleat in my ear randomly to freak me out.   Edit: added a few more details
It was the first time I'd seen that, and you know what? It disgusted me. Made me feel like I was blowing a little kid or something. Real men have hair down there. You hear that guys? REAL MEN HAVE HAIR ON THEIR PRIVATE PARTS!!!   Shaving your balls doesn't make your dick look any bigger either, I'm putting the damn thing in my mouth, There is no illusion there.
I understand that today's rooms in FPS are too complex to simply "build the room twice", especially when it comes to things like lightning, or destruction in  Battlefield .   BUT what I've been thinking about for some time now: Wouldn't it be possible to "abuse" some sort of stripped down "spectator mode" for this purpose?   The invisible "spectator" would be calculated on the server, placed "inside" the mirror, looking out, creating as many frames per second as there are players. Each frame is rendered with the spectators view looking in the direction of one specific player, thus creating a "reflection" of what this player sees.   For a 64 player match, this would mean the spectator creates 64 frames per second, each frame consisting of the reflection a player would see if he looked into that mirror. It would be 64 small, compressed images that would be streamed back to the client.   This would still be kinda choppy because for each individual player, the image in the mirror would only be updated once per second.   But it could be further optimised. Like only render a "player reflection frame" if that player is in the vicinity of the mirror, or double the frames the "spectator" creates per second.   Also, as it would be rendered on the server the game's running on, it had basically no impact on the client's performance other than displaying the picture created by the "spectator".   I'm no game developer, and this solution would be mainly aimed at games with an online connection (like online FPS), but maybe this could at least be an  idea  worth looking at?
It always sucks when you get a better faulty phone. It really sucks when your replacement device is in a worse condition than the one you sent in. What the hell is wrong with OnePlus?! This is completely unacceptable. Now don't get me wrong, the OnePlus 3 is a really cool device, famous for the whole big specs small price thing, but they really aren't good at the whole making sure you don't get a bad device twice in a row thing. What's great is the fact that the whole 15 day no hassle return thing is over since it took close to two weeks for them to send me the second OP3. Can't wait to get home and deal with their excellent (read:terrible) support.Now I know I am a special case but that doesn't excuse the fact that this happened.   Okay, sorry about that. Just wanted to rant but at the same time raise awareness about OnePlus and to give you an idea of what you're getting in to if you choose to buy this device (don't).
Hello fellow troglodytes.  I just recently bought minecraft and I gotta say I love this game.  While expanded my underground abode I decided to dig a narrow passage to the bottom till I reached the bedrock. My quest other than sure curiosity was diamonds of course.  I finally made way down to the very depths of my world and lo and behold, diamonds! Hold on though, theres some coal over there I could get too. Let's just open that up and OMG LAVALANCHE!
Male to female is near completely preventable. Anything that grows within/on the penile shaft which is covered by the correct type of condom won't transmit. What do I mean by correct type of condom?   Latex is best, if you have a rubber allergy or your partner does then there are other rubber products that work. Organic/natural condoms only prevent pregnancy however. This actually comes down to size of virus/bacteria/eukariotic cell vs pore size in the condom. What this means is that there are essentially holes in every condom, they very in size. all of them are to small for they eye to see. In latex and other rubber condoms these pores are so small that all STDs/STI whatever you want to call it can't pass through. There are a hand full of viruses that can, but they aren't typically considered STD/I as we think because they are common infections with or without sex. In the case of organic/natural condoms like sheep intestine/skin the pores are small enough that large Eukariotic cells can't fit through them (like sperm.) But these pores are large enough that even protazoa can fit through them.   The concept of pore size is something i use frequently in my labratory, If I want pure water or if I want to filter out everything above a certain size I can pick a filter to do that for me. We have actually considered using natural condoms as cheap alternatives for some filter sizes, but we don't have the time to set up the expirement proving they are a relyable stand in (even though the data is there from the companies that make them, we are required to verify everything we use.) But I digress...   Any HSV or HPV virus, will only be prevented by a condom if the ulcer/wart is on the penis of the male. But since more often than not these ulcers/warts apear around the genitals not on them condoms do not protect.   If you want to get into the specifics of the individual STD/Is vs condom I can. I can actually talk at length about Safe sex (and though unrelated to this safe food handling) for a while. It's important to me, especially with several of the sexually transmitted bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics.
Learning how to draw hentai is no different from learning to draw anything else.   As for book suggestions, don't use any of those books on how to draw manga. Instead, study anatomy textbooks. Before you make anything stylized, learn how to draw someone realistically. Once you can do that, you can caricature to your heart's content.   Yes, your art will suck at first. Everybody's does. Keep drawing, and show it to other people. Criticism is essential, as there will be a lot of flaws you won't notice that others will.
Okay, so from what I've gathered:   Greece, Ireland and Portugal are in a lot of trouble.. but they only make up for a small part of the EU's GDP, but this could still cause a crisis?  Spain and italy might also be in a crisis, but only kind of?   Ireland and portugal are just in a temporary slump but their governance is good so they'll get out of it.   Spain and Italy have issues with reform governance so they have high debt and unemployment, but they arent really in a crisis as of yet.   Greece has terrible debt and terrible governance, but they only account for a small part of the GDP, but they arent even trying to fix the problem...because they think that even though they are small, the EU can't afford to let them fail?  Why?  Is this all misinformation?
So I was in a game where we had a Naga disconnect many times and we paused a few, but it got unbearable so I took on the asshole role and kept un-pausing their pause. And then KARMA just fucks me over big time! As I'm sitting there furiously pressing F9, my power goes out in the house... Welp. I know I'm getting an abandon now. Power comes back on in about 15 minutes. Just for the hell of it I decide to rejoin the game. I feel bad for team. Anyway, I get back in and somehow my team manages to win the game. At the end I get +23 MMR! WHAT?? How is this possible? The only way I think this could have happened is that their Naga received an abandon before me therefore negating my penalty? Can anyone confirm this?
God your number two, I honestly had almost forgotten about. Leading up to Usopp's return, Which was an absolute manly tears moment, When Usopp admits his stubbornness, and Begs for forgiveness. Even When Zoro smiled, You couldn't help but realize, He's a man of his words. Which was originally kind of scary, because it almost felt like Zoro would take a long time to respect Usopp again. Zoro is truly an amazingly well written character. It's not until post Whitebeards war do you see everyone come close to Zoros amount of Dedication and Loyalty to Luffy, And Zoro Shows it early and for a LONG time.   This is not at all saying No one else is Loyal to Luffy, But Zoro honestly shows why he is Luffy'sright hand man.   The only Scenes I could add to this Would be, Robins cry to Luffy, The Farewell to Vivi, hanks saving Coby during Whitebeard,the Punch to the Tenryubito, Or even Choppers Monster point. I agree with a lot of people statements, a top 10 list is almost not enough. I could Keep listing off amazing moments. And that is why One Piece has become my #1 anime/manga/story of all time.   My faith in Oda's writing won't ever wane. He knows his fiction better then anyone. I can't wait to see what he has in store for each week. I would be happy if It never ended, but I know it will someday. But hes just so damn good, I've watched the Anime twice (Up to the point no more episodes are out) and have reread the manga 3 times. And Each scene is still as powerful as the first time I read/seen it.   Over All Great list. I'd love to see more lists like this. I love to discuss this anime with people who know it.
Being that you're obviously not a "car person" I'd advise you to try as hard as possible not to go into debt with this purchase.  Buy a two year old Infinity and after that honeymoon period wears off wears in a few months, you'll probably think of it no differently than you did your Corolla except that you'll be stuck with a $300 car payment for the next 3-5 years.   The stereo can be purchased aftermarket at any time with the potential to sound much better than a lot of the super expensive factory upgrade stereos they sell these days. As for maintaining the max payout, exactly how much are they giving you for that stereo?  Usually when a car is totaled, they let you take whatever you want (within reason). Without knowing the model, I can't imagine they're giving you more than $50 for it.   I could go on but I'm on my phone writing this.
I've been married for nearly a decade. Our relationship has never been very good, but we recently had a child together and I've decided to stop contemplating divorce and dedicate myself to making our relationship work. We're seeing a relationship councilor and things seem to be improving everywhere but in the bedroom.   Despite being fairly sexually active with previous partners, my wife and I have never had a good sex life. We have sex maybe 10 times a year. I've managed to bring her to climax three or four times total. I should probably be reasonably pleased considering no previous partner had brought her to orgasm. She used to say that she enjoyed sex regardless of orgasm, but that faded quickly once we were married.   To make matters worse, she's extremely conservative physically. She has gained quite a bit of weight since we started dating and is fairly ashamed of her body. She finds giving oral sex disgusting. She's not a huge fan of receiving oral sex. Ejaculate makes her rush to the bathroom to clean herself. Self-lubrication is almost never sufficient even after significant foreplay. Anything that touches her clitoris directly results in pain. Her nipples are too sensitive to stimulate with more than a very light touch.   I'm no trophy either in the sexual department. I've gained weight and lost hair over the years. My sexual appetite far out-strips my stamina. I prematurely ejaculate easily if I'm not wearing a condom, but condoms frequently cause her to get infections. With past partners, I would compensate for my PME with pretty solid oral skills and plenty of foreplay and postplay. This hasn't been sufficient for my wife.   While our sex life has never been good, the occasions when we had decent sex was when she was drunk. Unfortunately, she has developed an allergic reaction to alcohol, so it's been most of a year since I've been laid.   I'll save technique questions for another post, but right now I'm looking for advice on how to change our dynamic in bed. For years, she has seen sex as more of a chore to be put off as long as possible. She's seen me as partner who tries, but is incapable of consistently pleasing her. Even if I try to spend an hour or two on her (massage, lotion, foreplay, etc), I'm pretty sure she still sees it as a "favor" to me.   Even though I'm willing to research and practice new techniques, I'm convinced that our past dynamic in bed is preventing our sex life from evolving. Any ideas?
I just discovered /r/Games after seeing the CliffyB thread that boiled down to the anti-EA ness. I then clicked on this link and immediately thought "oh no, another F-EA link," but happily to discover it wasn't. It was a really good article and looked at MTX and the trends in the gaming industry from a pretty perspective.   Caveat: I am a founder of PopCap Games and currently an EA VP. So if that troubles you, take it with a grain of salt. Please don't insult my integrity by saying the only reason I'm saying things is because they bought my company for a lot of money.   I agree with a lot of what this article says. I also think that trends over time, as companies learn the right way to do MTX, it will get better for the consumer. The game industry is in this really tough transition time between retail gaming (make a game. release it. done) and games requiring constant updates and being live services.   It is really really hard for the game companies to figure out the best way. And I mean from all the perspectives. The consumer, the company shareholder, and the game developer. Like, really hard.   Yes there are great freemium games out there like League of Legends, TF2, and World of Tanks, but they are still the exception and are not easy to make. There isn't really a "best practices" list out there and every year we see new and different games with integration of MTX / Freemium. Some good. Some bad. The consumer expects freemium or microtransaction games to be great, but no one really knows how to consistently do it yet, even though we know it when we see it.   Additionally, in the world of connectivity, consumers expect more updates, add ons, bug fixes, etc over time. We are now in a connected web world and the expectation that features happen and change over time is real. This is expensive.   Lastly, the bigger the games, the bigger the teams and the more expensive a game is. We want high resolution graphics and the ability to play on multiplatforms. Soon consumers will demand a way to play or use their game on all devices, not just console or PC. That makes the cost go up. Game developers are not artists, they expect salaries, leaders of hundred person teams are expensive, etc.   So we have a world where consumers are frustrated they're not getting greatness, expectations for constant updates exist, and games nearly everywhere are getting bigger not smaller. All the while the game companies are making a lot of mistakes as they try and figure things out.   I do believe in the next five years the industry will figure it out. I (obviously) believe EA is on the forefront of figuring it out, even if it doesn't look like it. I believe that the cost right now is consumer frustration, but in a time of big transition of technology and business models, it's going to be painful for all. Many game stocks have taken hits, and many game developers have lost their jobs. Transitions are not particularly fun.   What does it look like in five years? Awesome. Games will span multiple devices and will always be updated / changing. You'll play fewer games, but what you do play will be more and more filling and dynamic. You'll really be able to try games out and vote with your dollar, and marketing will become less and less important than development, so game quality will go up and you as a consumer will rarely spend money on a stinker.
I actually wrote an article about this. It is from the legal perspective and examines how the U.S. courts view and understand social science and neuroimaging in video game litigation and as a basis of regulation. As i am not a scientist you should probably take these viewpoints with a grain of salt.   Yes, the studies are scientific and the researchers claim to have found a correlation between playing video games and expressions of violent behaviors.   However, there are issues with these studies. First is the fact that none of these studies have been able to prove that there is a  causal  link between video games and these behaviors. Secondly, even if there is an increase in violent actions there is no proof that video games are causing and actual change in behaviors. Thirdly, there are multiple issues with the testing methodology that is being used in  these studies. For example, one of Dr. Bushman's studies found that when you play video games there are certain physiological reactions like elevated heartrates.  The researchers claim that these responses change how you interpret images which will later have an effect on your behaviors. (Jodi L. Whitaker & Brad J. Bushman, A Review of the Effects of Violent Video Games on Children and Adolescents, 66 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1033(2009))   To me that seems to be a fairly shaky claim and just because your heartrate increases doesn't mean that you are becoming more violent. Alternatively to Bushman's theory there are other researchers that are stating that those same physical reactions and increased brain activity have other origins like the player is experiencing frustration at learning the game controls or solving the puzzles rather than becoming more violent. (Andrew K. Przybylski, Edward L. Deci, C. Scott Rigby & Richard M. Ryan, Competence-Impeding Electronic Games and Players’ Aggressive Feelings, Thoughts, and Behaviors, 106(3) J. Personality & Soc. Psychol. 441 (2014))   While the courts agree that there could possibly be a link between playing video games and violent behavior none of the studies have been considered to be a reliable basis at this time to take any sort of significant legal action. In every case that I have found every expert and every study that claims there is a definitive link have been rejected by the court. “None of the research establishes or suggests a causal link between minors playing violent video games and actual psychological or neurological harm, and inferences to that effect would not be reasonable. In fact some of the studies caution against inferring causation.” Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Schwarzenegger, 556 F.3d 950, 964 (9th Cir. 2009).
Fuck you, asshole. Don't go killing yourself! Live for others just like you're living for your dog. If you don't have a family, make one. If you don't have a girlfriend, try your best and get one. I believe that life isn't about making yourself happy, but making others happy which'll make you happy in return. If those that are around you can't be happy with who you are, move to a different city and start a new life. Fuck them. If they're making you feel negative, don't have them in your life. You're a human being that has a chance of happiness in this shitty world, and you're considering ending it before you  feel  that happiness.
I serve in the IDF, in the 8th brigade as a tank tech guy (basically everything to do with heavy gear optics), but i am far from health, i don't have a thyroid gland and every time i go to see my endocrinologist it's a long thing with at least 2 or even 3 days of not being in base at all, and 2 or three times being late by at least 2-3 hours. Obviously, my commanders hate it. And then comes the things the Dr gave me an exemption from... I am no longer allowed to work for more then 6 hours daily and I am not allowed to do guard duty. My main commander was pissed with no limits, despite me putting extra effort on the time i was there. I was being verbally abused. In the beginning it was mild, but a few days it was too much for me as another commander cursed me, saying i'm a looser and i give nothing to the unit. So i sent a complaint to a function in the idf that is responsible for those kind of things, it's completely unrelated to my unit, so there maybe a stop to this train in the future.
Years ago, I set up a fake myspace for our school principal. I then sent a message to a friend who was a teacher in another county saying how i knew she bought drinks for me and a friend and would be contacting her principal shortly. well, i go to work and when i get off my phone is blown up with messages from my friend who was sorta dating her at the time telling me she was prepared to turn in her resignation letter and all that.
I'm right there with you  except without the great results your having. I'm a beginner lifter but adding 70lbs to my deadlift in a month has motivated me greatly but I know there will be a day that beginner gains stop and I'll have to push weight up incrementally until I can't anymore. Martin Berkhan has a great article about not fixating on the marshmallow, I won't explain what that means but basically just stop fixating on trying to find motivation. Just make it a routine. Motivation is fleeting, consistency and discipline are what get you there.
Ok this is the first time i give an advice here so hopefully it will be of some help.   Learn to tell stories.   I have a similar problem, knowing how to communicate is very important. so learning how to tell a story preferably your story can have a big impact on your life. What did you do that day,what happened, special event, what you said and what other people responded, these are qustion you need to start of when you practice.   In order to gain proficiency quickly you should practice it in front of a mirror so you will be more aware of how you convey your story, your facial expression and body language can be a lot of help in you story telling. Start of by telling of what happened today. If you had an event that is bugging you try telling it to yourself and see what comes out, by telling a story you have an emotional connection(not just bugging) you will feel a lot more relived telling it, especially when you see reactions from the listening side showing they are engaged in your story, if they aren't engaging you need to sharpen how you tell it (or maybe they are just selfish people?).   Try practicing it once a day, just a story of what happened to you that day, with special attention to something that got you emotional about. Don't beat yourself up if you don't succeed first and you feel you have no point to what you are saying, just try to share and be able to express yourself more clearly, the rest will fallow along with practice.   Sorry if i have some problems with my English or punctuation.   Edit1: cleaning up and correcting myself(as best i can)
Texas (where I live) has a number of laws disallowing a manufacturer from selling their own product. Craft brewers just recently managed to get laws that kept them from selling their own product changed, so now we'll be seeing more brewpubs around here which means more money for everyone. Yay.   You see, most products are beholden to distribution systems that are already in place. For a company that makes beer (just to keep with the theme here) it would make no sense for them to try and horn in on their retail outlet's turf. The costs associated with operating as many retail stores as Anheuser-Busch has in their current distribution network would be absolutely astronomical, and you would never recoup the initial outlay.   This isn't true for auto dealerships.   It would be trivial for Ford, GM, or whoever, to come into the state and start undercutting their franchisees. Why would they do this? Well, it's more profitable for them. If everyone is buying directly from them, that means that all of the dealer markup instead becomes manufacturer markup. Yay! In fact, you're not going to get anything off of the MSRP. You're going to pay what they want you to pay and that's final. It would not behoove their competitors to lower their prices. By undercutting the other manufacturers all you're doing is indicating that your product is worth less money in the eyes of consumers. But does this matter? Well, yes.   You know how everyone complains about there only being a handful of ISP's, cable companies, and phone companies? Now imagine how much shittier it would be if you didn't have fifteen competing dealerships trying to sell you cars. No, you have three companies (keep in mind these laws were passsed in the 40's) that own practically every dealership. Instead of fifteen choices you have three masquerading as fifteen. There might be five Ford dealerships, but they're all owned by Ford. They all sell everything at the same price.   This is anti-competitive and anti-consumer. Neither of those are good things.   Whenever these laws were enacted the economy was poised to fucking explode. Auto manufacturers had become rich working for the government. GI's coming back from overseas had pockets full of combat pay. Men and women across the country had war bonds promising them a substantial chunk of cash in one lump sum.   It was a good time to start a business.   Many people did. Many of those were auto dealerships. In a move designed to protect fledgling small businesses, many states enacted laws that would not allow manufacturers to compete directly against these businesses. Why would the states do this?   Because it provides a net economic gain.   Instead of having one corporation that's probably not even in your state operating every dealership, you have a network of small businesses that directly impact the local economy. Instead of one corporation hiring in a handful of people to operate these places and taking most of the profit for themselves, these profits instead stay within the area. They are taxed locally. They are spent locally. By creating competition between dealers, you even create a better job market for salesmen as they can always demand more money from whoever they work for. This would be practically impossible if every dealership were owned by the manufacturer.   These are the reasons the laws were enacted. They were to protect small business from giant corporate assholes. This is still what they do. I don't see any circumstance where it would behoove any of the major manufacturers to try and overtake their dealership networks (it would be a fucking DISASTER in terms of PR) but that possibility remains.   Elon Musk has a pathological hatred of dealerships. This makes sense for a manufacturer of Tesla's size, but it doesn't for the larger ones. He's trying to position this fight as "Poor widdle electric car vs. BIG UGLY OIL"  when in fact it's "independent dealerships vs their corporate overlords". The manufacturers would probably love for Tesla to be successful.
Sometimes I go to the range with my brother. Thats mostly because I'm the one with the membership so he needs me to get in.     $100/year gets you 24/7 access (although they ask for a 24 hrs in advance notice to fire after dusk for safety reason) to an outdoor range. They say it's a 6 position 50 yard range but its more like 8-10. 9 positions at the 100 yard range and 6 positions at the 200 yard range. All of that is out door with canopies.     When I first got my membership I was planning on going 2x a month. It's been closer to 1x every month or two. Mostly because I can't find ammo.     They have plywood backs you staple your own targets to. Otherwise metal targets are allowed if they are resetting and placed by the backstop berm.     Rules? If you catch anyone vandalizing the property it's a $2000 reward to catch them.. The sign doesn't say if they have to be alive. Needless to say no one has been stupid enough to jump the fence and vandalize the property. Otherwise it's basic safety without being overly strict. Wanna draw from the holster? Go for it. Wanna shoot at targets of Osama Bin Laden? No rules say you cant. Wanna shoot at exploding targets? Nope. Can't do that. (Makes sense I guess. The only "no fun" rule they have) Eyes and ears are required (but no one is there to enforce it). Obvious no alcohol is allowed (nor anyone that is under the influence allowed on property). Minors are only allowed if with a parent or guardian.     Pros are everything I listed. I can't think of any cons other than I wish they had farther out than 200 yards for when I want to get into longer distance shooting. They also have an outdoor archery range and they have a woods course they set up from time to time. They have a club house and for an additional charge they have an indoor archery and pellet gun range onsite. Biggest thing (you decide if pro or con) is depending on the day or the season you might be the only person there. But they are all about self policing. I have yet to see any unsafe activities there, but that's not to say it doesn't happen.       Side note: HOLY SHIT! Some ranges are EXPENSIVE!!! I never complained about $100/year but I never realized what a great deal it really is.
When I was a child living in England, I went through a phase of believing that water spilled on the ground would pool into the shape of Great Britain, because it had sorta kinda looked that way a couple of times. The more I believed it, the more I imagined that spills were at least on their way to taking that shape. I even figured that it was because of the way that in the directions with more land mass, there was more gravity pulling the water.
My girlfriend is pregnant. Preface: We are both teenagers at school.   She's chosen to keep it. There are no life-altering illnesses that would compel her to abort it. She knows I don't want a child but she's chosen to keep it, why? Because of her religion. Now, this isn't any old faith, she's been successfully proselyted to Mormonism. That really rubs me up the wrong way but I'm crazy mad right now at Mormons purely because she had lost what faith she had before meeting the Mormon faith.   She had ambitions, she wanted to study Classics, become a university lecturer. That's great! She's throwing it all away because of the notion of sin. Her crazy and  so  fortunately religious mother hasn't cautioned her against this and neither has her jailbird, mentally ill stepfather. Only her bitchy little sister has voiced any reason. She's now going to go up north to live with her mother and stepfather and raise the child, when it's born around June.   I know the choice is 100% hers legally. However she has not taken into account how I feel and is now blindly pushing ahead because it's a sin to "kill" a "child". I'm left now with a moral quandary. Advise me if you will, /r/offmychest, but I don't know if it will help or not.   I can either:   *Follow her up north at the end of exams, enroll in a college or Sixth Form up there and continue studies while working to support the family.   *Continue with my own life. She's said she won't ever ask anything of me and my level of involvement is totally up to me.   This is awful. Deciding is terrible, it's a true dilemma. If I leave, I leave a bastard child, without a father to be raised by two crazy people. If I stay with them, I throw away any future. I'm on track for reading medicine or becoming a research chemist: the world is my oyster. I'm going to regret either choice forever.   In an attempt to get out of this situation, I've genuinely contemplated a murder/murder-suicide. It's not going to solve anything though, although the murder would have been a perfect one. The fact that I almost went through with it shows that I'm not in my right mind at the moment.   I remember always telling my mum, "Don't worry, I won't bring home a bird pregnant at 16." Well fuck, looks like I've got one pregnant. My parents will never find this out.   I'm sorry for this rambling discourse. I needed to get it off my chest. I've screamed at the air, at the bishops house, at the local Mormon church. I've made a desperate last-ditch attempt to break her faith and get her to see the situation rationally. I've cried, out of dread for the future, frustrated at my inability to affect the world around me and just as a release. If I had one wish right now, I don't even know what I would wish for.   I'm worrying for this child. If it grows up, what? Will it have religion pressed on it, either Catholicism from its grandmother or Mormonism from its mother. It'll be raised in a house with a BPD bloke with violent history, accused of being a paedophile by social services; a mental woman with a history of delusions and violence; its mother, a girl that's unequipped and not capable of being a parent yet. What if I meet it one day and we suffer GSA? What if I have a genetic condition and pass it on? Its mother has a genetic link to Crohns disease, my family has bowel cancer and heart problems.   I'm angry at myself. She was on the injection contraceptive but that was no excuse for not wearing a condom every time. I'm angry at her, her subscription to religion (and a crazy one to boot) has resulted in her making a choice that is fucking up her own life and potentially mine.   She's had an abortion before, she managed to bring herself to do it last time and she seemingly can't now. She had a doctor's appointment yesterday, symptoms of acute morning sickness. That was my last hope; he said she'd be fine and healthy enough to continue and deliver the baby at the end. Fuck. It's going to happen.   I'm angry at the LDS church. Not only do I disagree with proselyting in principle but  now  it's had an effect on my life. She was absolutely fine without her faith, the missionaries changed that.   I'm angry at her for subscribing to the faith. It's complete bullshit and not friendly to her, a bisexual who has slept with over 40 people (she doesn't even know exactly how many), has taken drugs, got drunk, had abortions, gangbangs, etc.   I even prayed. I've long wondered about religion. I've grown up surrounded by different faiths. Hindu father, atheist mother, Christian grandma, Muslim aunt and uncle. At no point have I been pressured in any direction but came to the conclusion that religion is basically bullshit. I'm angry at people who tell their children that God is real; it makes them believe there must be a god rather than letting them draw their own conclusion. Anyway, I prayed to see if it would help and I did feel better. I know why, because I'm blaming something intangible and incapable of responding or retaliating. Like punching a punchbag.   I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do. I've been numb for the past couple days. Within a month she is moving up north.   She says she would like me to be involved with the baby's life. She also says she wants me to go and be successful. I have to struggle with being a weekend father or whatever. I only saw my father in the evenings when my parents were together and now I only see him 2 days a fortnight; it's no way to be a parent. I despair for this child.   She's so holier than thou about this. It drives me wild. I say "This is a bad decision to make" she says "That's what you think. This could be one of the best things to ever happen to me. It will be hard but I will work with it with the help of those around me who love me. It's a greater sin to kill a child." I just feel broken inside. She's the only one I've ever loved, the only one who has ever understood how my broken mind works and now I've lost her to some hoax faith which influences her decisions.   Conclusion   The choice is entirely mine. Do I throw away a successful life and help raise my child? Do I pursue a high end career and forget about them? Do I take some middle ground? Should I even be at the birth? I'm angry at her, at religion and at myself for making poor choices. I'm sad, I'm going to lose her one way or another - babies aren't the best for cementing relationships. I worry for the child, it's probably going to grow up without a father or a decent role model, it's going to be like the [Fresh Prince of Bel Air scene at some point]( and I'm tearing up just thinking about it, but don't I have to put myself first?   It sounds terrible but I hope so much that this ends with a miscarriage or a stillborn.
Canyon roads where I'd want a supersport?   yes   > A sport touring I could take on multi-day trips?   yes   > A little SuMo I could have fun on the roads and off road with? (Is there a lot of good off road riding?)   yes   Joking aside ... I bought a Speed Triple because I wanted something sporty, agile, and I like the look.   I did just short of 10k miles last summer. It's great downtown or in the canyons and theres tons of great paved riding roads all around Denver and greater Colorado ... HOWEVER, having heard about lots of great gravel/trail roads now ... I want to get a dual-sport or sport-tourer that I can take offroad as well. I won't get rid of the triple, but I'll add to the fleet.
Also consider [Stack Overflow]( for those types of questions. Not only do they generally yield high-quality answers, but the question posting system will often suggest a similar question, perhaps with an answer that solves your problem.
Rather than remembering a specific thing... we remember the relationships between things.   We will recall something best when the set of relationships now are most similar to the set of relationships at the time the memory was laid down (you can remember more easily what you did when you were drunk... while you are drunk - you are in the same frame of mind).   It can happen that when recalling an idea, the relationships that are most readily accessible apply to peripheral elements of the idea.   There are some extra confusions. The act of remembering isn't passive - it alters our memories as we remember them. What we think is a memory of an event may be a memory of a memory (of a memory).   One can also  feel  that one had a good idea without there actually being a good idea. The feeling remains - but the detail never existed despite what the feeling suggests.
Short story here, really happened.   I was walking around inside the local GameStop, laughing at the ridiculously high prices of peasant games, when suddenly a about 13 year old kid enters the store. Ok, no big deal, but unlike other kids, who would have gone straight for the xbox/playstation games, he went to the gift card/voucher section of the store. Searching around he finally found what he had looked for: a 50€ Steam Wallet code. Holding the small plastic card, he walked to the cash register and greeted the Cashier.   Kid: Excuse me?   Vendor: Yes?   Kid: Have these cards got any sort of age restriction on them? (points at the Steam Wallet card in his hand)   Vendor: No. They should have though, seeing as you can buy games there that are for people with 18+ years.   Kid: Yeah, sure. I'll take two.   Vendor: Two??? (gives the kid a confused look)   Kid: Yes, two. (takes 100€ out of his wallet and puts them on the counter)   Vendor: Okay then.   The vendor then printed out the two codes and gave them to the Kid, who took the piece of paper, carefully folded it and put it in his wallet. The kid then left the store, with the biggest smile on his face.
So I got the Quake selection on steam from a friend recently and decided to try it. I have never played Quake before, which I see now is a sad thing, but on the bright side I can now enjoy it as a brand new experience. I've started with the first Quake, and my plan is to complete them all eventually.   What I find that Quake offers is a intense fast-paced shooter that, although its outdated graphics, was able to scare me at times, which made the experience more enjoyable and forced me to get on my toes (metaphorically) and really made my mind think a lot faster. It's difficulty also has me retrying again and again, until I complete a chapter. This is extremely enjoyable and I feel how I get better and faster at the game.
I'm sure many people will think I am selfish/a dick after they read the post. If you think that, so be it. I don't really care. Just remember that I have made my decision, so it won't do any good to try and counsel me otherwise.   That being said, I was always very close to my mother growing up, and when I say close, I mean inseparable. We went on special adventures and did all kinds of cool activities. If I showed an interest in something, she always encouraged me to pursue it and helped me in other ways, too. And she also smothered me with all of the love and affection a child could want. She was a great mom and still is in some ways, I guess. That was my childhood. It was just my mom and I against the world. (My dad wasn't in the picture.)   However, around the time I turned 14, my mom met her now husband, my step-father. Tim is alright as far as step-fathers are concerned. He always treated me well, but we were never (and will never be) that close. Eventually they got married about a year after they met. Up until this point in my life, everything was fine and I even had, I think, adjusted well to having Tim in my life, but soon after they got married my mom told me she was pregnant. I wasn't exactly shocked. I knew that Tim, having no children, would probably want to start a family with my mother, and to be honest, I actually had always wanted to be a big brother.   The next nine or whatever months became hell, though. I started having some problems in school (dumb teenager drama), but my mom no longer had time for me. She was so focused on her pregnancy that I completely disappeared from her radar. I was hurt, but I wasn't surprised nor was I that upset initially. I understood that at my mom's age, and given that this was only her second child, this was to be expected. However, I did think that she might have time for me at some point, but she never did. She wasn't mean to me or anything, she just ignored me.   I think you can pretty much guess that things got worse as my mother got further along in her pregnancy. To make things even worse, the drama at school as intensified, but when I tried to get my mother's help, again I was ignored. The pattern repeated itself until my sister was born. Oh, and she also almost forgot my birthday that year. It was about a month before my sister was born, and she would have forgotten had I not reminded her. It then continued for the next two years until I went off to college. By that point, the damage had been done. On the plus side, those experiences made me a lot more callous and better prepared me for post-high school life, but they also created a lot of strong negative emotions.   This is getting too long, so I'll try to summarize the rest. I went off to college, and around that point my mother seemed to recognize me again. She wanted to do all sorts of things for me and as a family, but I no longer cared. I think I returned home once my freshman year but only for a day or two. I rarely returned her calls or texts. I pretty much went no contact after I went to college. I have seen her probably less than 4 times since then, and even that seems like too much   My mother hasn't taken this well and has begun overcompensating in order to rebuild our relationship. She buys me an absurd amount of gifts at Christmas and for my birthday, but I always send them back. She tries to message me or contact me in other ways, but I rarely response. She also has tried to involve me in my sister’s life, but I have no interest in her either. Plus, it's not like we grew up together anyway. This will sound arrogant, but my experience with my mother over the past few years has taught me that I don’t need my family. I have done well in college and am set to do well after I graduate.   Eventually, I got tired of all this and sent her a message. I told her that I wasn’t mad about what had happened in the past, but I also didn’t have any desire to be a part of this family. On the other hand, I also did not want my family to be a part of my life. Too much water has crossed the dam for us to reconcile. It would also be too hard for me. I can be a stubborn person, and I am not good at forgiving and forgetting. Basically, I just think we should go our separate ways and remember the good times we had in the past.   She hasn’t given up yet and is now trying to plan a big party for my 21st birthday in a month. I’m at my wits end. How can I get her to understand that she is wasting her time and that I am serious when I say I don't want anything to do with her?
No, and a sucky as that is, there is a very good reason for it.  It states in the constitution or something that a person can neither be imprisoned for an act which was not a crime at the time, but has just been made illegal, nor can a person be released by decriminalizing the law that they broke before.  This is to prevent governmental corruption by getting people into or out of jail by changing laws.  For example there is a really influential drug lord, and he gets busted.  Without this safeguard, he could potentially use his influence to have the laws changed and himself released, despite being guilty.  On the other side of the coin, if say there was an election coming up and the incumbent felt threatened, he could introduce a bill to make something that the opponent had done previously illegal and then imprison him, securing victory through non-democratic channels.
I was just looking at schedules and noticed some interesting similarities between the Giants/Vikings and Giants/Packers game:     Both are in primetime (Vikings on Monday night, Packers on Sunday night)   Both are away games for NYG   Both the Packers and Vikings have defenses that are powerful in their own way and offenses that have obvious potential to produce     Aside from being interested in seeing the Pack pick up another W, I'm also interested in seeing how both teams perform against what I can only assume will be a relatively similar team (barring of course major personnel changes or injuries).   In my opinion the Packers appeared to be more cohesive and productive against the Lions. It looks like Aaron got his head on tight and the offense is learning to play together as a unit. The defense continued to play like studs for the most part. I also feel like the Packers are notoriously sluggish coming out of a bye week for some reason, so it will be interesting to see if they can keep this production up or if they will go back to square one. If they come out firing on all cylinders this will surely be an opportunity to upstage the Vikings in a side-by-side stats comparison.
Okay, so this fuck up did not happen today, it was actually a couple of years ago. But, I still thought it would be worth sharing. So I used to work at this frozen yogurt shop and my manager, lets call her Susan, used to text me all the time to cover someones shift. Well at the time I had been dating this girl, we'll call her Emily, for a couple of years and it had been going pretty well.  I was really into her and our conversations via texting would spice up pretty quickly.   Anyway one day we were feeling extra horny and engaged in one of our favorite exercises and played 'Who can outdo the other and give the sexiest compliment game'. You know, that good ol high school fun. So we were in the middle of that when Susan, my manager, texts me asking if i can cover a shift. Having two conversations going at once, one of which is nsfw is risky business, and I found that out the hard way. I respond to Emily's sexy compliment text with, "Oh yeah? Well you have an even sexier butt."   Only it didnt go to Emily. It went to my manager Susan.   But wait, it gets even better fellow reddittors.   So doing a little cover my ass, i quickly text back and blame that last text on my younger brother who supposedly stole my phone and sent that out (even though he would never do something like that).  Susan however, accepts the cover up much to my surprise and life goes on and i never told the brother I blamed it on about it.....   Now my little brother that I shamelessly blamed that fuck up on is working at the same frozen yogurt shop and for the same Susan i worked for. And he has no idea
Apologizing for the format, mobile.   Seventh grade. My first day attending a public school. Scared and skittish, I painfully passed through the halls, clutching my books while averting any eye contact that wasn't with my shoes. Not five minutes into the day, the rambunctious class clown ran up to me, looked me straight in the eye and confidently said,   "What are you?"   Deeply offended, I did the only thing I knew to do from those peppy Disney shows: I slapped him.   It turns out, attending a primarily white farm town school for years was boring for this class clown, and as a kid with Korean heritage, seeing another Asian, especially a girl, really excited him.   Eight years later, we're still happily stuck with each other.
It's just an icon set, so it should work flawless.   [Edit]
I have been seeing a new guy for around two months which has not been made official yet he refers to himself as my boyfriend and we are openly a couple. He has a reputation around the workplace (yes... I am screwing the crew...) as a bit of a ladies man which makes me nervous on one level. I will often stay at his house for a week or two weeks at a time and we are heavily involved with each other's routines. However, I have been struggling with the fact that we don't have sex as often as I expected. He is not afraid to touch in a public setting nor at work nor does he seem afraid to make funny comments about the sexual side of our relationship (i.e. when I have a headache, he asks me if I am needing to have sex) but 9/10 times we will get home and he is talking about how much he can't wait to sleep and will turn over and do so.   I feel quite shallow having an issue with this, but I just don't understand. He is a very confident, out there person but will not initiate anything with me. In fact, he prevents it from happening by turning his back to me or falling asleep! When we do have sex, he will make comments about how we don't do that enough or about how he enjoyed it... But doesn't push for more. I might expect this if we had been together years, but I thought a new relationship would mean we couldn't keep our hands off each other!   It's just making me sad now, I'm starting to feel less and less intimate with him and more like a good friend who sleeps in his bed and that he buys lunch for sometimes. I don't know what other explanation there is.   I guess I'm wondering if this is something that happens when a relationship starts off slowly.. Or his confidence is masking his real fear.. Or he just isn't attracted to me/can't be bothered and is along for the ride and the company..
So about 2 weeks ago, I met a really nice girl at a friend of mine's party. We started talking and eventually got off (No Sex). The next morning, we promised to see each other again at some point in the future and to organise something. Ever since then, we've been texting to each veeery flirtatiously. She asks about sex, fantasies, etc etc. Stuff on that sort of lines. However, about a couple days ago, I recently found out through a friend that her parents had gone through a very tumultuous divorce, alongside with having a previous relationship go horribly wrong. She told me the details and I thought "Ok, maybe she's not too worried about it." Wrong. She texts me pretty much everyday about how something in her life is wrong, whether she's think about her ex-boyfriend or her parent's divorce.   I'm completely torn in half with this matter. Part of me wants to be there for her, assist her in her time of need. Yet the other half is saying "Abort, abort." I don't know if I can deal with a girl's emotional baggage, yet I want to be for this girl when she needs help.   What should I do? Stick or move on?
Bad guy Kodak printer   Uses color ink in  all  greyscale printouts, regardless of if set strictly to greyscale in computer before printing, under the guise of "superduperhighqualitymegaphotoqualitysuperprint" quality printing. Considers cartridge spent when levels are kind of low.   WILL NOT print in greyscale if color cartridge is out. Has a printer head cleaning mechanism that actually uses ink, and the mechanism runs itself after every instance of printing.   what^fuck
Hmm, well since I am a Shark, I think it will be appropriate if I think something related to them.   Sharks could be more of a defensive / support faction. They have extra Movement Speed, Evasion and Attack Damage when underwater, gathering resources like food and gold is safer for them since they don't have to worry of being attacked early in the game (Yay for boat-less fishing) and they could find treasure chests underwater, their units are cheaper and somewhat tanky but have little to no armor.   But gathering other types of resources like stone, wood and gold (treasure chests are not reliable) could be a problem, since of their awful mobility on surface, and their inability of using any type of armor other than gold.(gold doesn't rust).  Buildings to create siege units and ranged units would have to be on dry land (Because physics and such), and since they live underwater they wouldnt have to fear cold or rain, making no supply block cap / population cap.   So in short:   Pros: Both water and land units (Town center and other buildings must be built on water) , Extra bonuses on water, No supply/population cap/block, Some-what durable and cheap units.   Cons: Fire weakness, Debuffs while on dry land, Little to no armor, Armor / Weapons upgrades are expensive, Needs dry terrain to build some buildings / units.
I mostly play western RPGs (Fallout, Dragon Age), but I'm going to say one that hasn't been mentioned: Assassin's Creed II. The first game was a good starter point, but it wasn't anything spectacular. The sequel scaled up every aspect, and did it while taking the risk of an entirely new protagonist + era.   And it worked out wonderfully. The game is incredibly cinematic, and while some areas could be shortened or polished (Venice), AC II was a game that knew exactly what it needed to be. The amount of historical thought put into the game is amazing (realistic death dates for Templars, etc.). Also, this is before they decided to "expand" gameplay by adding bullshit non-assassin missions (looking at Revelations' strategy game as a prime offender), so the only real distractions are upgrading the villa (which isn't all that terrible), and doing the cute puzzles to collect tomb seals.
I know nothing about baseball so I'll assume the ball has a mass of 100g and is composed entirely of carbon, giving 8.3 moles.   At 0.9c, by   Ek = (mc^2 / (1 - v^2 / c^2) ^1/2) - mc^2   it has about 1.16E16 J of kinetic energy.   The distance from the pitcher's mound to home base is about 15m, and the ball has a radius of 0.04m. So, it sweeps out a cylinder with volume, by   V = pi r^2   d   of 0.07m^3. Assuming that air is entirely ideal diatomic nitrogen (N2), at 298K and 100 kPa, there will be   n = PV/rT   2.8 moles of N2 in the way.   Now, I'm going to assume that the fusion results in the entire mass of the air and baseball fusing into iron. This is where things get very off-track, because we'd have to exchange some protons for neutrons. Nevertheless, I calculate a mass of 0.1780kg of nitrogen+carbon, and 0.1778g of iron (we can make 3.178 moles of iron from 2.8 moles of N2 and 8.3 moles of C). This 0.0002kg gives us extra energy by   E = mc^2   of 1.8E13 J, negligible compared to the kinetic energy of the ball, and about 25% of the energy of the Hiroshima bomb.   Alternatively, all of the atoms could fragment into alpha particles. This calculation is slightly more realistic, as there are even numbers of protons and neutrons present. From the nucleons present, we can assemble 44.5 moles of helium, with mass 0.1781kg. So fragmenting all of the mass would actually reduce the energy of the ball! But only by a tiny amount.
PART 2: MONEY IN THE REAL WORLD ACCORDING TO MARX   To go through every single idea by every single radical theorist would be way too much so I’m just going to focus on the big man himself: Karl Marx. Do note that, in terms of radical critical theory, this is just scratching the surface, but no one talked more about Money than Marx, so let’s get right down to it.   MARXISTS   The Marxist view of money goes back to the original purpose of money – as a measure of exchange value – and then looks at the problems inherent in the whole damn shebang. This is most clearly outlined in Marx’s magnum opus, Das Kapital, which is a formidable text. If you’re one of those sticklers who want a source, I am specifically covering  Das Kapital Vol. 1  right now.  I recommend David Harvey’s  Companion to Marx’s Capital  to help out with understanding this stuff (which is far more complicated, tricky and nuanced than Keynes or Von Hayek since it is much more a fusion of sociology and economics instead of straight up guns and butter economics) but to quickly breeze through Marx’s theories of value, here’s his argument in butchered, simplistic layman’s terms:   In a capitalistic society, everything revolves around commodities. You, me and that random troll downvoting you with the throwaway account: we’re all material creatures. We measure our lives in stuff, in the clothes we buy, in the food we eat, etc. What Marx was primarily concerned about was how the hell do we measure the value in these commodities? What makes the Dolce and Gabbana sun dress worth $3,000 but the K-mart whitey tighties just $5? They have the same use-value because both items are essentially just clothes. Right? So why is the exchange value so remarkably different?   Whoops, I’ve gotten ahead of myself. Marx isn’t coming up with anything new here, economists have figured the difference between  use-value , or the value you get out of actually using something, and  exchange-value , the value you’d get trading it for something else. This distinction is usually brought up when talking about opportunity cost, that is, what the benefit and disadvantage of keeping something versus trading it away. What Marx was baffled by was how completely unhinged from use-value exchange-value could be. Ever pay too much money for something that you thought was complete crap? Well, then you know how Marx felt.   What Marx realized was that there actually isn’t any relationship between use-value and exchange-value anymore, at least, not when it came to money. Exchange-value had, in his eyes, essentially overwhelmed use-value. Since all commodities are exchanged through the medium of money (what Marx would call the “fetishized commodity of exchange-value”, and by “fetishized” what I mean is this: [ it is money that determines value, through both the systems of supply and demand, and also the social construction of value.   This is important. When Marx says we are fetishizing a commodity, and he doesn’t limit “fetishized commodities” to just money because we can very easily fetishize any commodity, he really simply means: we have a fetish for this commodity. That is, if we fetishize money that means WE FUCKING LOVE MONEY. Just like in Idiocracy. It’s really as simple as that. We will fucking do anything for money. Just like how a Dolce and Gabbana sun dress can be a fetishized commodity to Paris Hilton (for maybe like 5 minutes before she gets bored of that look), the majority of the human population is completely enslaved to money. We worship it.   Money becomes the way we measure value, when it should be the other way around. Rappers can’t stop rapping about it, you can become famous and celebrated just for having money and no talents (talk about lack of use-value! I suppose Kim Kardashian has been able to at least become the vessel for Kanye’s offspring though…) and if you do have money, you are afforded a level of social power that no one else can touch. Don’t let big words scare you here, what Marx is saying is that WE FUCKING LOVE MONEY and it doesn’t make sense because Money was supposed to be a tool for us to figure out how many sticks of butter a gun is worth and vice versa, not an ends to itself. The "use" of money has gone completely out the window, to be replaced by an incessant and never ending need that can never be filled.   From here we can delve into more advanced Marxist theories, like the coercive laws of competition or the volatile, destabilizing effect of overaccumulation. But this isn’t r/Marxism, so I’m going to try and only lightly touch on it. I can sum up the logical extensions from what I’ve outlined about the Marxist view of money in one sentence:   More is never enough.   Take Marx’s “commodity transformation equation”: the capitalist exchanges money for commodities, which is then transformed into a higher exchange-value commodity (this step can actually be stepped if you’re engaging in what’s called “arbitrage” but let’s leave that conversation for r/hedgefunds) and then traded for…  more money. This sounds like a massive word salad of pretentious academic jargon speak, but allow me to simplify it with what I call the “Gangster’s Commodity Transformation Equation” (this will be easier to understand if you’ve seen “The Wire”):   Get drugs -> Sell drugs for money -> Get more drugs -> Get more money -> Fuck bitches   As you can see, it’s all in the game, yo. Try not to get high on your own supply, but otherwise, Scarface said it best: “First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women.” In other words, once you have enough money then it becomes what Marx would call “capital”, and then you have power. You control all the corners. But then you then become trapped in the game because the moment you stop playing the game, you will lose that power (this is the “coercive laws of competition”) and then someone will just step up to your game and fuck you over like how Marlo fucked Avon Barksdale.   Go back to the original Marxist commodity transformation equation: Money -> Commodity -> More Money. It’s not just a linear equation, it’s a  never ending loop . You will never ever be able to escape, because the moment you start spending and enjoying your money instead of reinvesting it into commodity transformation, then you stop making money and you start losing it. Combined with the tendency of the profit rate to fall (this is Das Kapital volume 3 material so I’m already digging too deep) you will almost always be stuck capping more fools, diluting your testers and just generally becoming more and more ruthless in order to keep making more money.   All those corporations you hate? You think each individual person working for that corporation likes being told they’re “vampire squids raping the world economy”? But the fact is, if the corporation stopped trying as hard to make money in whatever ruthless way they’re making it, then their competitors will just wipe the floor with them and the corporation will die a slow death and lead to the end of lots of people’s livelihoods. And we’d be no better off because some other corporation doing the exact same thing will have replaced that corporation, simply because the social power granted through the mass accumulation of money is too damn good to drop.   Why I wanted to quickly touch on the conclusions of where you could go with Marx’s initial premises about money is to point out the conclusions drawn from thinking of money in this way, like how I have outlined the conclusions for policy drawn by Keynesians and Monetarists. As I said earlier, the Marxist view of money is just a lot harder to tackle in general because the Keynesian and Monetarist prescriptions are very straightforward. But in the Marxist framework, the game is straight up rigged. No matter what, you have to fuck someone over to succeed (and this goes into concepts like the alienation of labor etc.) and at the end of the day we’re all fucked because we’re still trapped in the never ending need for more, more, more, and money is literally destroying our souls because that’s all we care about.   Now, from here, we can branch off to different flavors of radicalism, some believing that money should be eradicated completely, with some others believing that a socialist-communist-anarchist (depending on your flavor, again) society can be achieved with money, and we can talk about lots more radicals than just Marx (such as Bakunin). But this isn’t r/Marxism, r/anarchism or anything like that so I won’t go into it, but the point is, Marx’s prescription is completely different from that of a Keynesian or Monetarist: that prescription is that we should just burn the whole damn thing down. And that’s that for Marxism for now.
In short: No... The full story: No.
My older brother has cerebral palsy, mother was a single mom and extremely religious. i remember always being in church with her while she prayed repeatedly. i grew up resenting him for always getting attention. when my stepdad came into the picture he got me out of those types of situations. my older brother use to flip out and get violent and attack my mom. now he lives in a group home in moreno valley and is under a lot of medication and a lot calmer now. he visits once a month or so but i think its a better life for him because he has friends like himself. It is no cake walk.
At 7:30 this morning my wife's uncle passed away from an OD. He was not well liked by his family and mostly abandoned his kids and stole from his parents (violently). It's still extremely sad because this guy is survived by his 6 kids. Some of them are still at the age where they just know to love their dad regardless of how much interaction they get to have with him.   My selfish predicament is that I really don't feel the need for me to go to his funeral. Now, if I lived in the immediate area I wouldn't think twice, but I am an 8 hour drive or a couple of plane tickets I can't really afford away. The job I have right now can't really let me take off work to go. My wife also isn't comfortable driving the 8 hours herself to go to the funeral. Finally, she seems to really want me to go with her, so she doesn't have to deal with the stress and family sadness alone.
I think a lot about religion how it comes to play in all the little moments of my life.  I try to be respectful to people but have a particular impatience for superstitiously-guided reasoning.   I was watching the movie Taking Chance ([IMDB link]( and found myself moved in a appreciative way by the moments of respect and giving in the movie.  Most were seemingly rooted in religion and patriotism; not really a surprise in an American movie referencing the USA military.   The surprise for me was the internal feeling I had that there were certainly moments in a person's experience where I would not tread.  Moments that were.... sacred...?  Sigh.  And then the confusion and questioning set in.  Am I an enlightened atheist except for those moments which were taught to me as a child as being above examination?  Are there semi-private moments in our life that should be noble beyond question?  Or is everything ignoble and plain, as I've come to tell myself?   I like the plain truth and am a scientist/engineer/educator.  After thinking for a moment, I realized that I do indeed have some beliefs that I can't quite explain to satisfy the question of "Why is this sacrosanct?".   After a night of thinking, I've realized that three things mean so much to me that I am not sure how or why they exist in me as they do:     The birth of any living, emotive creature.   Commitment to share my life with someone.   The death of any living, emotive creature. (Hence, my train of thought starting from the movie.)
Hey everybody, I'm a digital illustrator of two years, and a manga studio nut. I was thinking about how when I got started, I absolutely hated the feel of my palm on the screen (and the accidental button presses), but it seemed kind of rare to find artists who were using gloves to solve that and the sweat/palm-rejection stuff.   I was just wondering if and how often people use gloves along with their tablet? I've been making my own for some time, later decided to manufacture them, and I'm curious as to how big an audience for such a thing really is.   I'm running a kickstarter in the coming weeks with these gloves, and while I have the design, pattern, manufacturer, and all of the logistics lined up, I'm bit of an outsider who hasn't yet managed to find an audience except with people I know personally.   Before you ask, I do know about the other gloves on the market. I've had two of my competitors' gloves for awhile, but the lack of length on them made it a pain to really rest my wrist onto the screen. I also wanted all 10 fingertips exposed because I do a graphic novel, and thus alot of typing in Manga Studio.   If y'all care to weigh in, I've got some questions:     Do you think you'd need one?   If you already have a glove, what don't you like about it if anything?   How much would you pay for one?   Would you pay extra for a custom printed glove with your art on it?
I think the main difference you're seeing there is that the first list is all tier 9/10 tanks or scouts, tanks that people will play after having a lot of experience with the game.  In addition, they're tanks that skilled players really enjoy and can get the most out of.   Tanks in the second list tend to be common feeder tanks that people will go through early on in their tanks career when they don't reeeeeeeally have a good idea whats going on.  Even current unicum players probably had bad stats in a number of those tanks, so the sheer volume of bad play will drag that weighted average down.
No one will probably read this now but what the hell. Was visiting New York about six years ago with a friend, and ended up meeting these two Russian bar maids who persuaded me to go with them to some club in Brooklyn. The place reminded me of the opening scene in 'Blade', and quickly started to sober me up and just wanted to get back to my hotel in Manhattan.   Problem is when I leave, it's like a blizzard outside and there are zero taxis to be seen. Some huge bouncer tells me I'll need to take the train over. So I'm now walking round Brooklyn with no idea where I'm going, fully aware I may end up on the news 'British Tourist Found Dead in NYC'.   But out of the blizzard I see a little Chinese man holding a plastic bag. I mumble about getting to Manhattan and he says "follow me." He takes me to the station, helps with my ticket and puts me on the right train. However, due to the weather the trains get messed up and I have to take another. Somehow, I'm in Coney Island, the sun is creeping up and I'm still drunk. All of a sudden though, this classic New York sounding guy strikes up a conversation but I end up falling asleep after a while. However, out of nowhere he wakes me up "we gotta go, come on follow me". Whatever, I guess this guy knows NY so I follow him on and off a couple of trains and then out of the subway. He's managed to take me directly to my hotel. He waves me off with a "have a great time here, stay safe" and just walks off.
I recently just finished my freshman year of college which I don't think I was ready for at all. I took 60 credits and got a 2.5 cGPA. Therefore, I 've chosen to leave school momentarily and become a phlebotomist to pay the bills while I get ready to give college another go. A career in medicine is something I want desperately and something I refuse to give up on. If any of you have had a similar experience or have any advice to offer, your input is more than welcome.
Hey, so I've been thinking, whenever I talk to someone, I can have interesting conversations and such, but I'm never very witty/funny. I can be funny, but not in the sort of quick-speech way which is something I'd want to pick up. Is this posisble? Can you teach yourself this, or is this something you just pick up i.e. can't teach?  Thanks
From Rocket himself: >They are heavily working on new renderer. Will add Dynamic Shadows and lighting, move to Direct X 11 and Open GL, Vastly improved FPS on the client, in the process of re-working all assets to be compliant with the new abstracted render.   One of the main issues with FPS at the moment is the current renderer not utilising modern hardware correctly. The sheer fact the new renderer will be moving to Direct X 11 and Open GL will massively mitigate these problems as they are both designed to work optimally WITH modern hardware.   Those new graphics cards people keep wrongly buying thinking it will improve their FPS with the current renderer will suddenly actually start doing their jobs properly.

Your capacity for carping has no bearing on anything.   I used to develop simple games with Unity 3d on my $300 netbook without complaining.   Just recently bought a nice lenovo with a Core i7 and dedicated graphs. Holy shit, does Unity 3d fucking sing now.
back in the 30's. In the 40's there was the war. In the 30's he was already rounding up political opponents (meanly communist) and putting them in concentration camps. Than after the Pearl Harbor indecent, America did the same with the Japanese population who where living in the states.
I got a good one!   It was my first time travelling by myself in a new place. I flew to New Orleans to attend that Jazz and Heritage Festival in '06. This was after Katrina.   Took a redeye out from LAX, and got to New Orleans early in the morning. My cousin was going to arrive that evening, and our friend was going to pick us up after he got off of work that night.   My original plan was to hang out in the airport, catch some sleep, and wait for my cousin to arrive, and our friend to come get us. Once I got there I thought to myself, "What a wuss you're being...go explore!" So I did.   I locked up my stuff, and took a bus into town, met some interesting folks on the way in, was proposed to by one heck of a suga' momma, and eventually got into town. I toured around the city, fell asleep by the river for a bit, and kicked it by myself all day. This was the first time I had ever really done anything like that by myself.   When I was trying to get back to the airport to meet up with my posse, I got a bit lost on the bus routes and ended up in the wrong area. Since it was only several months after Katrina, the place was deserted and completely destroyed - it was surreal and depressing.   I got to the correct bus stop to take me back to the airport, and it was only me and this really creepy looking, dirty, crooked old guy waiting in that area...nobody else was anywhere near us. It was a ghost town.   I started freaking out a bit. Here I am, young white kid from Orange County, in a completely new place by myself for the first time, and nobody around but this scary looking black dude. All I had heard on the news prior to going was about how there was looting, and general mayhem/lawlessness in NO in the wake of Katrina, and I was just psyching myself out.   I'm convinced that this guy is going to mug me, so I decide that my only course of action is to approach him, and try to make friends with him so that he will develop some sympathy towards me, and will not murder me and leave me in an abandoned house.   "Is this the bus that goes to the airport?" I ask   "Yes. I believe so."   "Do you live around here?"   "Well I used to. I'm trying to get back."   The bus comes, and we end up sitting next to each other, continuing our conversation. During this 45 minute bus ride I had, what turned out to be, one of the most stimulating and gratifying conversations I've ever had in my life with this man. The reason he was all grimey looking was, of course, because he was restoring his home that was destroyed during the hurricane. He turned out to be a professor. He was an activist during the Civil Rights Movement during the 60s. He was amazing.   We talked about all kinds of stuff; Politics, FEMA, Civil Rights, Hurricane Katrina, Racism, his life, my life, and so on. When we arrived at his destination we were both astounded at how happy we were to have met one another. We parted ways with the most sincere hand shake ever, while we both exchanged genuine and exuberant thanks for a fantastic conversation.   I felt like such an idiot for letting my preconceptions, and my scumbag brain, get me all worked up over nothing, and I was so glad that I approached him to talk.   His name was Greg. And he taught me the true meaning of the phrase, "Never judge a book by its cover."
Have a conflict where a player i dropped for a free agent is still listed on my roster.  now i have both players listed on my team, should i make duplicate waivers?  Dropped OJ Mayo (was in starting lineup and had already played) for Free Agent Austin Davis Monday night since Mayo was hurt; Today when tryign to do waivers both of them are listed on my roster as options to drop if waiver claims go through.   Do i need to make two waivers one dropping austin and the other dropping mayo to pick up a Waiver player?
Is that really all you got man?   You might as well of said  "Oh man, this is hilarious!"   Wow and the top comment to a stupid pic. (Not for long after this is read) you see friend at reddit there is a tool. It's called the upvote button. (This tool has a counterpart which we will get to later.)  You see the upvote button is kinda like the "like" button on Facebook. (which I'm guessing for your incredibly thoughtful response, you are very familiar with.)  Now let me tell you a little difference between reddit and your Facebook. The upvote button has a symbiotic relationship (almost yin yang) with its opposite. The Downvote button. It's pretty much how to show the guy or gal posting above you anywhere from "hey I don't agree with that statement" all the way up to "go die in a fire you insufferable shit" (in this case it's the ladder) Beautiful concept huh? So maybe take it back to Facebook or you will suffer for not stopping yourself before posting mindless rants In the comment section.
Rofl. After I graduated highschool me and my homie caught a ride up to vegas and rented out the finest hotel room we could find for a week. Circus Circus is the epitome of the Vegas high life. Homie had a beard so it was really easy to get drinks despite being underage.   After four nights of getting drunk on the strip and trying to pick up some tourist pussy, which went about as well as you'd think for a pair of drunk, broke teenagers, we decided to break out the MDIA. We just split what we had brought, about 1g a piece, and started walked out towards Fremont Street.   After an hour or so it was apparent that this shit was doing something. We couldn't exactly put our fingers on it but it was definitely warping our perception of things. I had trouble telling exactly how large things were and things' size were skewed. Kind of like the big head cheat in Tony Hawk.   We end up walking up to some scuzzy adult book store and decide to check it out. I'm tripping hard. but it's a confused kinda sick trip. Like if I drank too much water I'd vomit all over the place sorta shit.   Anyways we decide to see whats in the back of the shop and find a row of peep show booths. I'm like fuck it, let's check it out, and I pay my two bucks. Shit was literally two dollars. Personally, I would really consider whether or not it'd be worth it for me to take out the trash for two bucks, and there's bitches out there willing to rub their clit at plexiglass for that shit. Kind of a weird sense of respect and repulsion at the same time. So i go in my booth and this chick starts going at it. All the while she's playing with her pussy and I'm slipping dollars into her stage I can't help but think,   "Holy fuck, her head is huge. Is this what Bratz dolls do when they get addicted to smack. Is Ken her pimp? Holy fuck what's that on the wall, oh she wants another dollar, holy fuck what the fuck damn your someones fucking daughter. I'm fucking tripping"   Me and my homie both walk out at about the same time, both teeth chattering and pupils dilated. The girls are asking if we want a private show, but fuck that. So we leave and this random dude comes up to us, "hey you guys look like you're having fun, want to have more fun?" Our curiosity is peaked so we're like, "hell yeah we want to have more fun, where the party at?" Motherfucker, reassures us that he's on his way to a party and that he's got ecstacy and weed. I ask to see it and he gets all sketch and asks to go somewhere more private, and he leads us to a series of darker and darker alleys. At this point me and homie tell Motherfucker to fuck off cuz we're not about to get stabbed from some sketch as dude selling drugs to people who come out of sex shops.   Homie and I are fucking done. We just want to go back to our room. We find this homeless dude give him twenty bucks for some gin and orange juice and walk him over to a convenience store. He comes out, hands us a bag, and bolts. A 5th of gin and a 20 .oz bottle of generic OJ. Motherfucker, should've given him a ten. So we say fuck it, go back to the hotel room drink our gin and try to go to bed.   Nope. Tripped for 8 straight hours. We had the tv on but it was just there. The words and images made no sense. For like 45 minutes I was certain we were watching Mask, but it turned out the big head cheat was still active. We mostly sweated and took turns vomiting. I jumped in the shower and tried to beat one out to help with sleep and my dick told me to go fuck myself. I don't know if I've ever been more scared than that moment standing in the shower, limp dick in hand, checking my pulse to see if my heart was going to explode.   I just kept myself hydrated and awake until I felt better and we made it all right. just a little emotionally scarred.
As I've said in my [previous post]( I work for the largest university in my state, serving one college.   A couple days ago, I told some users how to hook up a monitor, as their whole office ($UserOffice) was getting dual monitors; they told me that they could do it, as they said and I quote: "we're just matching blue pins to blue pins".  I even had a couple of them successfully do it in front of me, I was so proud.   Today, we get a call from that very office.  I guess that was wishful thinking.   My boss ($Boss) sends another one of our technicians ($OtherTech) over to that office because a user's second monitor "won't turn on".  $OtherTech calls $Boss shortly after getting to $UserOffice. > $OtherTech:   Unintelligible   > $Boss:  Oh, was that it? Thanks, $OtherTech.  hangs up  Slurpee, you need to choose your words carefully next time.   > Me:  I'm sorry, what?   > $Boss:  You forgot tell $UserOffice to plug in the power.
No, definitely don't lie. Never be ashamed of that number, whether it's 5 or 50.   I made this mistake with my ex. I asked how many people he'd been with and did NOT like the answer. In retrospect it wasn't from a moral standpoint, but because our sex life sucked and I was jealous that he'd been with so many women but has issues being intimate with me. After we broke up, I slept around for about 6 months and racked up them digits. And it was awesome.   Which then made me realize...having a bigger number isn't a big deal! I think in every relationship there should a policy about  not  asking questions you don't want the answers too. I would never ask my current SO his number, because I don't want him to ask mine. That shit doesn't matter.   If you have a loving, committed relationship and a healthy sex life, then the past needs to stay in the past. Anyone who focuses on that is not marriage material to begin with. That in itself should be a red flag (IME/IMO).
You have no idea who I am or how much education I have. No one insulted you until you started insulting others. You are a troll.   I don't have to read wikipedia about this. Looking for edges in casino games is a hobby of mine and has been off and on for years. There is no edge here (and there rarely are in any of them, the casinos make quite sure of that).
So, I was at the store picking some stuff up yesterday and I see this girl who I went to highschool with, never knew her in highschool at all,just that she was sorta cute, sorta cute apparently turned into REALLY cute in the 4 years since highschool. Anyway, when she was ringing me up I was light hearted and she was cracking jokes, I ask if she graduated from  ___  and she said she did and we got talking. She didn't have a clue who I was , no surprise since everything about me has changed in the last 4 years. I don't even walk the same, I lost over 100 lb and got ride of my social anxiety(or learned to power through it, tomato/tamato) and she ask my name, I gave it and she didn't remember me, once again, not a surprise. Then I checked out and left. Didn't think anything of it, had a pleasant conversation with a girl, been having a shitty week, so that was nice. Next day she added me on facebook, little weird but I thought "whatever" an accepted. So now I'm sitting here, she is really cute, and I kinda want to contact her, but don't really know how. I mean, I don't want to send her a facebook message that says "hey, whats up", but its all I can think of.   Ultimately I have NOTHING to loose here. I mean either she realizes who I was in highschool and is blown away by how different I am she is impressed, or she remembers who I am and wants nothing to do with me (in which case what would I care about her?). So, the real question boils down to "how". I mean, I'm somewhat encouraged that she added me to facebook, but can't take it to mean much because it could be something as good as "oh that guy was cute lets look him up on facebook and add him to see if he talks to me" to her seeing me on the "you may know" tab and going "oh, we have some friends in common, YA my number of friends on facebook is bigger". So, I don't want to read into that to much,but it at least tells me she isn't repulsed by me. So thats nice.   Ive only been on 2 dates in my life, and that girl was THROWING herself at me. So, I'm not very good at this at all. I don't even know what to do to start a conversation with her. But, since I got nothing to lose so I figure I might as well. The question is "how"
flying out the back window of a car was pretty interesting. Not so much a 'I'm going to die moment, more a this is gonna fucking hurt moment!'   Edit: Might as well add it anyway!   About ten years ago my friends and I got hold of a Mistshubishi GLSXI I think (it wasn't stolen or anything!) pretty rapid car. The first no sign was the battery was dead, nevermind, we will just put a mates car bat in instead! Didn't start at first but with some tinkering, we got it going. The second no sign was the back seat were not bolted in, and no seatbelts in the back. the four of us decided to take it to some decent roads about 20 miles away and have a blast in the car anyway.   3 miles down the road or so and we are on a narrow 1 lane country road, and at that point, the driver decided to put his foot down and nail it. We got up to about 85/95 and then we ran out of straight road and it banked to the right in a mini sort of s-bend. Obviously, as we were going far too fast we went up one side into the hedgerow, down, up into the other side and then slamming down back on to the road again. during all this me and a girl were on the back seats, (remember, not bolted nor belts) bouncing around in the back, her head cracked/smashed the back window and due to the car bouncing about and us two going everywhere I ended up flying out the back window completely. I landed in the road on my hands and knees.   We had slowed down enough, but I reckon the car was still doing 25/30 mph when I went out. It ground to a halt 40/50 yards down the road. the girl in the boot luckily not hurt at all, just glass in her hair and the front two OK as well. upon realizing I wasn't in the car anymore the driver came running down to me where I was starting to stand up. I was fine till I put my hand on my knee and realized that, actually that really hurt! I looked down and my entire right hand/palm was a bloody mess, I had put my hand on the back window sill to stop my face, neck catching on it as I made my way out.   He dumped the car in a layby just up the road, written off, front left wheel bent 90 degrees the wrong way, all windows smashed, panels totaled, washed my hand with some water we found and wrapped it in a jumper, grabbed the battery and started the long walk home. got back to mates house an hour or so later and his mum saw us/me (only one injured in the end) asked what happened, (she told us not to go, that it was a bad idea!) bollocked us then and sent me to hospital.   Luckily, no stitches required and I only have a small 1 inch scar on my palm that you can hardly see and one that runs down then around my [finger]( and onto the palm. so all in all really lucky! The hole in the hedge is still there 10/11 years later! sorry for the wall of text!
From what I understand, arsenic typically comes into the water that's served through wells.  Major metropolitan city water supplies typically have very low levels of arsenic.   If the arsenic in the water is at a high enough level to be of concern, I wouldn't trust a Brita filter, no matter what they claim.  I'd go with some kind of under-sink mega-filter that's proven to scientifically and specifically remove arsenic.
I couldn't agree more. I used to be the same way. I've given up on them as a music group. Its the same recycled shit its always been. (I apologize if you still listen to them) I used to think painting my face and rapping their lyrics about magnets and murder was awesome. Now? Not so much.
As far as the meta game goes, Muk's stats are much better competitively. But design-wise, I never had a problem with Garbodor! I can see how people would think a living garbage bag is a lazy concept, but I think of it this way: Pokemon live in every environment imaginable (underwater, desert, icy mountains, etc.) and I really loved the thought of this lumbering oaf of a creature hiding in alleyways and junkyards. I see the Trubbish/Garbodor line as the funny little hoarders of the Pokemon world. I think they are some of the most urban/contemporary designs that they have made, apart from the mechanical Pokemon (Magnemite, for example), and it just furthers the adaptability concept of Pokemon.
people who were infected with chicken pox can get shingles because the immune system is too weak to hold the virus back anymore.  When you are infected with a virus it never leaves, your immune system just kills it before more cells are infected or it become dormant.   Chicken pox vaccinations only contained the weakened virus, so it does not infect any cells before the immune system kills it, so anyone who was never sick with chicken pox will not get shingles.
Hey eNTs as we all know 420 is up and coming. I can honestly say that I am a moderate user (Toke 1-3 times every 4 months or so) When ever there is an opportunity (particularly parties/kickbacks) I toke/vape like theres no tommorrow. Now this always happens around the weekend. National Toke Day is on wednesday.. So what the hell is my point you ask, well how l can I partake with all you Ents on this glorious day, without getting caught? (Yeah another case of strict anti-pot parents) Im sure there will be reference on T.V. as well. Maybe I should just not partake then?? I miss getting baked... Sigh
I think there is a line between people who for one reason or another have something against r/Atheism and people who are atheists who feel misrepresented by it. Some of us are just trying to point out that there are some of us out here who don't say "Holy shit, look what these dumbasses did THIS TIME!" whenever a christian does something dumb. That being said there is a lot of stuff on r/Atheism that I appreciate, like the support for this kid Damon who is being treated like shit by his school district.
Hi Reddit,   I know this is out there, but I it's been racking my mind.  Awhile ago, I read an article about a psychoanalyst marketing guy who had a marketing firm come out to see him (I think they were in Denmark or Sweden) and help give him ideas for an ad pitch.  He drove them from the airport through a specific route and talked to them about specific things and then asked for ideas on a pitch.  They pitched him and then he revealed that he had written down the pitch beforehand and basically predicted it.   Anyone heard of this article?  Am I crazy?   Thanks.
Nope I don't dislike it (even if it could be better explained and deeper). You don't "help" the enemy. You play one faction. But if you fuck up your internal power balance sb. within this faction will be unhappy (= CW).   If you use don't like the other families to have this one general: Assassinate or bribe him. Or just be happy that the others have an (equal) political heavy-weight so that they won't rebel because you seem to strong.   There is no point in strengthening the own family only. You have to balance power. And in fact as long as you go for the best candidate the number of generals is fairly equal in all internal factions. If each family is in charge of a different front you'll even have a powerbalance without having to waste too many thoughts about politics.
Such a first world problem, but ahhhhhh   All I wanted was some chocolate, ya know?   So basically I really wanted chocolate raisins from the candy machine, and I carefully deposited my last quarter (that I rummaged through my entire bag for) into the machine. Turned, waited. Nothing.   Fuuuuuuuu. In my chocolate deprived rage I turn to the janitor, who's cleaning the floor with one of those big Zamboni like machines. He turns off the thing to hear me.   "Do you know who's in charge of those things?" Food and dining services of the school, who aren't available at this hour. I've resigned myself to my chocolate-less fate, when--   He pulls out a handful of change and hands me a quarter. So many mixed emotions at this point, I feel twinges of guilt as I accept the coin. On one hand, I'm a terrible person to take this guys's hard earned cash, even if it's just a quarter, for my selfish pig-out. On the other, I really want chocolate.   I thank him profusely and he goes on with his day, probably not even thinking twice. I turn back to the machine. Let's be safe and try the choco-covered ALMONDS this time. It's completely full, should work?   The machine swallows the quarter again.   I walk back to my study spot in speechless disbelief.   Now I'm cooped up here, feeling like an asshole for disappearing on the cool janitor dude after taking his quarter, and needing to rant.   /over.
Based on various interviews with the people involved, it seems to boil down to this: In 1989 Faith No More released an album called "The Real Thing," and several singles from that album for which videos were made. The video for "Epic" became very popular, and Patton was suddenly seen in silly clothing, swinging his long hair around, rapping to Faith No More's funk-metal sound, all over the world. Anthony Kiedis seems to have been oblivious to the fact that this sort of combination of funk, metal, and rap (always accompanied by bad clothing and hair) had been the trend on the West Coast for some time, and wasn't actually invented by his band. Envious of Faith No More's success, and angry that it seemed to have been achieved at least in part due to the wild frontman who he thought had stolen his "moves," he accused Patton of ripping him off in the press.
LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE     Country of purchase: Japan     Budget range: $500-$600 (50 000 - 60 000 Yen)     Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Gaming-ish     Screen size preference: 15-ish     OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows       As far as the laptop goes, I know I want something with a dedicated GPU, preferably Nvidia. I want to play recent games at a reasonable graphics level with adequate frame rates. I don't need a snarling monster on my desk.   Japan is rife with Intel 4000 chips in all of the stores I've been to. Or, Something like the Acer Aspire V3 with Gt 640M is almost a thousand dollars. I am trying to keep my price below that.   I was having a good look at eBay and tried to purchase there. However, eBay did not work. My account was completely suspended. I'm trying to resolve that, but who knows. It has to do with a) creating a new account, because I couldn't remember shit about my old one b) not being able to use paypal, because it wants verifications I can't provide: it wants to call me to confirm my identity. It has an old, unusable Canadian phone number and won't allow me to enter my Japanese number. So that option is out.   A lot of the budget items listed on the side of the sub are sold out, not for sale, etc. I've hunted around on Future Shop Canada, Newegg, Amazon.com, .ca, and .co.jp.   I'm okay with refurbs that show sufficient paper work.
I am having trouble finding a sound protocol for culturing mice splenocytes. What I want to do is plate the splenocyte suspension I get after isolation in order to proliferate it. Eventually I want to have enough flasks so I can freeze some cells.   So basically my question is what do I do at the end of the isolation protocol in order to plate my cells. What do I need to have ready before I isolate my cells in order to culture them?
Most important overlooked fact about GG. There are mobs out there with 0 precision points, GG is the highest dmg output to those mobs I have found.
Wow, you kind missed the point.   See, the reason women are making less then men for the same work (and despite shady8x's rather terrible post they actually are, if not at all to the extent sometimes claimed) is because enough employers are reluctant to hire women that it causes a pay gap.   Your question is a bit like "if it's really dry in the desert why doesn't it rain more?".  The reason it's dry is  because  it doesn't rain, and the reason there's a paygap is  because  sexist employers are NOT willing to hire women despite the paygap.
Disclaimer: I'm a medical student - not an expert by any stretch.   Most scars (like the one you linked) involve taking skin and putting it back how it was. In mastectomies you are taking a 3d structure and making it a 2d structure (that still has to accommodate motion from the shoulder).   There are plastic surgeons that have good outcomes with skin sparing mastectomies (save as much skin as possible and use an implant). Tricky thing is… the woman has to agree to have the plastic surgeon be at the first surgery, and that's a time where many women are more focused on living than having a good cosmetic outcome. Many women are just hoping that they won't die or have to have more surgery/chemo/radiation… so cosmetics is just too far down the list of worries.   I'm a 4th year medical student, so I'm no expert. I've seen about 15 women go through mastectomies. The general surgeons I've seen give the pre-op talk have offered plastic surgery, but only two chose to have the skin sparing mastectomy with implant. I was shocked at first that every women didn't go for the implant…. but I guess getting diagnosed with a potentially deadly cancer makes the shape of your chest seem less important.
10% off of high end cars and expensive military vehicles, or even personal aircraft, is awesome.  I'll use them next time something comes out for those sites.   Also, don't report people just because you think they are "douche bags" just because they kill you.  Report people who are cheating.  Don't report people who are aggressive, but otherwise playing cleanly.  That makes the person doing the reporting the douche bag, and punishes the other player for doing nothing wrong.  Since you aren't actually submitting a ticket to be investigated by a third party, you would be instantly giving that player bad sport points simply because you're mad that he killed you.   I'm not saying you do this, I'm assuming that you might, but, in general, players should be careful to only report or commend when it is appropriate.  If a player gives you job cash out of the blue, commend him!  Or not.  Who cares. If someone tricks you into thinking they are giving you a vehicle, and it turns out to be rigged with explosives, don't report them just because it was an asshole thing for them to do and you want to exact some sort of petty revenge.
Issue   I noticed a problem a couple days ago. It was set to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity, but when I would try to bring it back from sleep (pressing key) it wouldn't budge. I noticed the light that would be orange for sleep wasn't on either - indicating that it was just off. But I could also hear the fans running. So that was weird ... Had to press the power button and it would boot back up, like it was off (should have been in sleep though).   A couple instances later and the power button wouldn't even bring it back, so I had to unplug the power cord and plugged it back in. Then pressing the power button worked and it booted up.   Now pressing the power button doesn't work period. Unplugged and plugged the power cord back in numerous times, changed sockets too. The little green light on the back of the psu does comes on when it is plugged in. (Has a very slight flicker to it, never looked close enough before to know if that is the norm or not.)
one of my (kind of unrelated) coworkers had an infant that, at about a week old, began to cry relentlessly.  she was trying all the stuff, and nothing worked. late night trip to the ER.   the first thing they did is unswaddle the baby entirely to find one of her very long curly hairs wrapped tightly around 2 toes.   must have happened when she changed a diaper the day before.
if he is like me, he was feeling embarrassed that you busted him.  The 1st couple of times my SO caught me jerking, was pretty tough i was pretty embarrassed by it. Nothing came from it.   2nd time same thing.   3rd time little less so but i let her join in and help finish but i was still embarrassed and it took a lot for me to allow her to do that.   I wouldnt worry about and wouldnt waste to much time on it, esp if nothing has changed, which by your words (>The whole time I was with him yesterday he was acting normal and affectionate.) they havent
Hello Reddit! The girlfriend and I are (sort of) new to Lexington Kentucky and we're looking for other couples to befriend. We're both in our mid 20's, professionals. I am finishing a Ph.D. at UKY in Chem Engineering, and my girlfriend works as in IT at Tempur-pedic. I've been here for over a year now, originally from Philadelphia, and she has been here for a few months, originally from NW Indiana.  It's been hard for her to find friends her age (that aren't your stereotypical creepers) working in IT,   I'm wondering if there are any other couples in the lexington area who would like to go out, double date, etc etc, to make new friends!
My boyfriend of a year and I are avid gamers. We really enjoy MMO's and play with mutual friends. Recently we've been playing an MMO that has trade pack runs where you make money from crafting an item and going a distance to deliver it with the highest value. Myself, my BF, and our mutual friend do these together and I usually driver the truck and they pile in on top of it.   It was a trip we've done many times before and we talked and bs'd each other and sometimes they fall off and will have to get back on. (it's not meant to have passengers but people can stand/sit on it). It's an inevitable thing that will happen and they made bad woman driver jokes and it was like water off a duck's ass to me. They then proceeded to start making very crude comments about Jews and how they are dirty like "Arabs" and how I should go back to the desert. Okay whatever I rolled with the punches and made jokes back and made a fat joke at some point. It wasn't even a mean joke. Our mutual friend is over weight and he wasn't even offended by it but my BF was. He stopped conversing with us the rest of the duration of trip and we didn't even noticed.   After we reached our destination my BF turned in his packs and abruptly logged off without saying a word. Me and our friend continued talking for a few minutes and I eventually logged off and tried to call my BF. His behavior is kind of predictable so I knew something was wrong. His phone was off so I texted him to see how he was and went on with my day. He never called or texted back so after a few hours I gave him a call and he answered. I could hear it in his voice he was upset about something and our conversation went like this;   Me  - "Hey how are you doing?"   BF  - "I'm fine."  long silence   Me  - "Listen, I know something is wrong and we talked about how there wont be any beating about the bush anymore so tell me what's up?"   At that point I thought it was something with either work or his family. His Mom has mental health issues and her behaviors sometimes stress him out and upset him. I honestly thought it was something of that nature.   BF  - "It's rude you made a fat joke to MF. You know he's fat how could you be so thoughtless?"   Me  - "Um.. you both were making jokes on my expense about me being a woman and being Jewish. Besides he has a thick skin and knows the difference between being genuinely mean and a joke."   BF  - "It doesn't make a difference. You should know better."   At this point I started to get pissed at the double standard. Me and MF always joke around and he is the least self-conscious guy I know. He will even crack the occasional joke at himself. Besides that if he felt hurt by something he would talk about it because he's a pretty level headed guy. If what I said hurt his feelings we would have talked it out but he was his normal cheerful self who just got done having fun with his friends.   Me  - "Isn't it a double standard to make fun of me being Jewish and a woman and then get angry with me for making a fat joke? If anyone should be offended it should be me but guess what? I'm not and neither is MF."   BF  - "You know he's fat and you just have to rub it in his face."   Me  - "I never rubbed it in his face. He was never offended you're being offended for him and it's ridiculous. Why is your logic such a double standard? Why is it okay for the both of you to make jokes about my religion and sex but it's wrong for me to crack a fat joke?"   BF  - "Because I hold you at a different standard and you should be better than that."   Me  - "So by your logic when you guys say such things to me, that I am "above" reciprocating the joke and I should just sit there and be the butt of it?"   BF  - "Fuck you"   He deactivated his Facebook and turned off his phone. He can be over sensitive and has had jealousy issues in the past and expects me to chase after him when he does this but I wont. When I wont it means I'm cheating in his mind. I am really on my last thread. I put my phone silent and I checked it after an hour and I got a barrage of texts from him stating how he's wasting his life on me and how I'm a terrible person and how I am going no where in my life. Okay... I have a masters and in a career I love I guess I'm not going any where.   I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I just don't understand his logic. He can be pretty illogical at times when he gets inexplicably upset over the most mundane meaningless things. We actually had to sit down and talk about him talking about what's going on instead of him getting mean and angry that I didn't know immediately what the problem was. Nine times out of ten it's something that I did that he either saw as insulting or insensitive. One example is talking about androids and sentience with our mutual friends. He felt like I was talking to them too much and not including him. Our friends have joked to me that he's more of the "girl" in the relationship and I am the "guy". I'm just mentally exhausted.
I was about to make a post about how the inhuman from Maveth could be an adaption of Hive (after having seen in mentioned on a wiki page); but then I realized after a search that someone had [already posted it]( Yet that said, it had received very little attention.   So, I'd just like to reopen the topic for conversation. If you agree or disagree, I'd really like your input on the matter - but please don't just bash it. There's a lot of things going for this theory, but if you disagree, please just list your reasons why :)   Ok anyways, here's a bunch of reasons why "It" from Maveth, could be the MCU adaption of Hive from the comics.     Both are in relation to Hydra (In the comics, Hive is basically an embodiment of the Hydra ideal).   While a creation of Hydra in the comics, Agents of Shield have already shown us that they can re-imagine characters as Inhumans (e.g. Daisy / Quake)   Hive is literally a collection of many parasites, and the parasites can split from the main collection. (And it's shown in 'Maveth', that Ward's dead body had some kind of parasite under the skin)   Thus, Hive is able to occupy host bodies (like the inhuman from Maveth)   Explains why Hydra needed to keep sending sacrifices over. Because the parasites constantly need a new body, as the old one deteriorate   Hive is an enemy of the Secret Warriors. With Agents of Shield going this route for the latter half of series three, what better villain to introduce then an actual Secret Warriors Villain? (An inhuman against other inhuman (plus you throw Lash into the mix and you get something really interesting)).     So there you go. If "It" does turn out to be Hive, it would also make sense why it's so dangerous. Imagine if each parasite could spread or multiple. That's serious world threatening stuff right there. But what do you guys think? :)
I feel like this girl had absurdly high expectations based on your age and the length of time you've been together. A $130 ring is pretty extravagant for her 18th birthday.   If you always paid for dates after 2 years together, that's biased too. I believe in equal rights in relationships and I can't say I'd be very comfortable with that set up. If you ask someone out, the person who asked the other out is obligated to pay for the first date (and yes, this means that if I ask a guy out I would expect to pay). After that, I think you should either take turns, split tabs, or devise some sort of compromise if one person drastically out-earns the other. If a guy asked me out on a date I'd still bring my own money and offer to pay for myself the first time, and it would be a pleasant surprise if he bought my dinner - NOT an expectation.   I feel your girlfriend is operating off of the gender norms of about 1955, and that she's immature. She broke up with you because you didn't spend enough money on her? Because your house is messy? In my opinion, those are either bullshit cop-outs because she wants to be with the boy from the school trip and can't get the spine to tell you so, or, she actually believes that. In either case I think you're better off.
Long time lurker here and I have a question/opinion;   Am I the only one that thinks instead of giving your ideas to the subreddit of League you should actually go over to the forums with your ideas?   I agree immensely with a ton of statements and requests made here, but I think putting your opinion over on one of the forums would be a better way to get a Rioter to notice.   Riot does have multiple people from their teams with Reddit accounts that check the subreddit,  but checking Reddit isn't a part of any Rioter's job, they choose to come here of their own volition.   You also have the added benefit of helping Riot's forums become a better community as a whole by just adding your own thoughts.   Now a bunch of you might say that the official forums for League are utter shit, which I might agree with, but just having everything of importance that could help the community or make the game better be almost exclusively on the subreddit does jack shit.
As I mentioned in the title, I am quitting a job that I absolutely hate. I work as a server in a fine dining restaurant and the money is fairly decent, about $400-700 on any given week for about 25-30 hours of work. My coworkers are all every nice (as petty as any server though), we get along well and hang out on the regular. The restaurant has been around for 21 years and has great customers, some of the best that I have ever waited on. However, the cons of working for the owners outweigh everything, even the money.   The owners of the restaurant are absolutely the worst people that I have  ever personally known in my lifetime. Wife runs the front, while the husband is the head chef. The wife checks every check at the end of the night and goes over each table to tell you where you should have sold more. She has told me that I was fat multiple time or that I couldn't have a table because my butt "wouldn't be able to fit". The staff is told every week at shift meetings that they (the owners) do not care for us. We are solely there to make them money and then go home.   Getting to the point, despite being told the owners do not care about us, when anyone quits or leaves their job for any reason they are immediately cut down because they are essentially "abandoning" them. The owners have said multiple times that they do not except notice of any kind in the event of quitting. Everyone that I have witnessed quitting has been met with rudeness and cruelty. They are not thanked for their time or wished well, nothing. "If you don't want to work here then leave."   Despite all of this horribleness, I would like to leave in a peaceful way because having this reference on my resume is actually quite important due to the long-standing popularity of the restaurant.
Im not really that much of a military strategist or someone familliar with the actual workings of our military, but what I understood this training to be was that it was new training for which we didn't already have training programs/teachers in place. Perhaps in the future once we have a large base of soldiers trained in that skillset, we can fold this sort of thing back into our own programs. Looking at the amount spent, that seems like a small amount in terms of normal military spending, so I wouldn't really guess it's a large number of soldiers that have been trained. Perhaps that is something that is planned for the future?   The thing is, right now we have a government that is commited to fiscally sound spending (inb4 loololollol, I know) and so I'd imagine especially with contentious issues like the new jet purchase, they'd be looking to set up new programs and things in the cheapest way, which outsourcing currently is. If they were to spend the money on developing that in Canada, Im sure there'd be people crying over the military spending in that scenario.
Hi r/climbing. I'm a fairly inexperienced climber but a long time lurker. Long story short I was motivated to try climbing again. I organized a small group of my friends to check a local indoor place out and we had a blast climbing for almost 3 hours. I haven't climbed since birthdays as a kid, but I was able to do 5.8s no problem and a few 5.9 with practice. I forgot how much fun and challenging this is! I can fully appreciate the climbs some of you are capable of doing right now. It blows my mind.   Anyways I'm thinking of taking this up as a hobby and I need some advice on gear. I feel rental will be too expensive for me as I will plan to do this at least once a week if not more. However I'm still just a university student and don't have a lot of money. What are my options for introductory gear sets to be able to climb indoors, and eventually outdoors? Primarily interested in just harness and shoes at the moment.
So, recently, I have been arguing with a friend about the correct form of our beloved nickname, "trees". I say the correct term is "trees" when refering to it in a plural manner. My friend thinks that it should be "tree" all the time. What do you think?
i caught my boyfriend jerking off/masturbating while talking on the phone with me. at first we would have a normal conversation, then he would go into his own world after that (if you know what i mean). he knows he hasn't hung up on me yet. he just tells me to either "hold on" or that he "fell asleep". - he already confessed that he's done it before on the phone. he promised never to do it again (i gave him an ultimatum. either don't do it while it's our time or i break up with him). he chose to never to do it again - yet he still does and repeatedly lies about it. he even calls me a bitch/retarded for accusing him when i fully know he's doing it. (i can hear the hand motions/the squeezing lotion tube, his deep breathing/moans, etc.)   i don't know what to do. i lost a lot of self-respect for myself. i find it hard to believe/trust him now, and lost a bit of respect for him as well. he's a great boyfriend, he treats me well outside of this. but when he jerks off over the phone, i feel like i'm competing to get his attention. (with the porn or with his own personal time.)   mind you, i don't have anything against him jerking off. he can do it on his own time. is it wrong for me to wish he doesn't do it over the phone/on our time?   is this a big deal or not? am i just being dramatic about it? I NEED HELP. i've come to the point where i just don't even confront him about it anymore. it's the same routine. he'll deny it, we'll fight, and i would beg for him to forgive me for 'accusing' him. i need your feedback/opinions.   any girls experience this with their boyfriends? or any guys done this to their girlfriends? is this normal? should i just let it go?

The other day, I was thinking how a Brain is just a group of cells, which are effectively atoms. Atoms are also what build up the structure of every object in the world... Effectively, since Atoms make up the structure of, say, Wood; Our brains are made of Atoms too - Technically based upon the same thing... Probably not worded it correctly but:
I'm an avid mountain biker who got sick of paying tons of cash for on-trail designer nutrition. I spent a couple years paying $20 per 20oz bottle of Hammer Gel and $1.50 each for power bars. Last year I started moving toward cheaper, widely available, and (IMO) better options.   Note: a lot of the designer products add electrolytes to the mix, something the grocery store stuff lacks. To compensate, I take Hammer Enduralites (electrolyte powder in capsule form) during long rides.   Replace hammer gel with honey. Use the same 'hammer flasks' (6oz, refillable & squeezable). I cut the honey about 5:1 with water to make it flow better. The stuff is amazing, natural, and cheap. I usually pay about $12 for an 80oz bottle.     Hammer Gel: $1 per oz (and the bike shop NEVER has your favorite flavor)   Honey: $0.15 per oz (and you can get it in almost any grocery store in the world)     I replaced power bars with snickers bars. They've got about the same calorie content and they seem to have a great balance of sugar, fat, and just a bit of protein. Enough to keep you going on a long ride.     Power Bars: $1.50 each (if you buy them 12-at-a-time at REI)   Snickers: $0.61 each (in a six pack at just about any grocery store)     You could probably save more on both of these shopping coupons/sales/warehouse stores.   Other stuff that I -- or friends -- do:     I (sometimes) replace Heed (which tastes like crap IMO) or Gatorade with Mountain Dew. It's a mixed bag because the carbonation and the intense sugar can be a bit much. I usually only do this on long intense rides and I think of it as my "anti-bonk insurance policy". If I'm starting to bonk I will grab for it. The sugar and the caffeine are usually enough to pull me back.   Peanut M&M's instead of Shot Blocks   Cold fried chicken for "solid food" at 24-hour endurance races (insane, but so effective)   Beer for re-hydration after a long ride (see article below)   Chocolate Milk for post-ride recovery (yep, it works)     Beer as hydration (plus, it's FUN!!!!)   Lastly, so much of a demanding performance sport is finding what works for your body. These work for me and might work for you. Try new things, listen to your body, and go kick some ass!
Used Laura Moser, didn't keep her safe, leading her to die a brutal death in front of her two sons.     Takes Dexter, separates him from his brother and never tells Dexter about him.     Lies to him about his parents deaths and who they were.     Leaves Brian behind as if he wasn't even there, he loses his little brother who he fully remembers, doesn't get adopted, becomes even more fucked up as a result.     Completely neglects his biological daughter to train his adopted son to be a killer, who he apparently never seeks any professional help for (unless you wanna count S8 and Vogel...ugh). Deb ends up with serious issues as a result of being ignored.     Takes his own life instead of dealing with the consequences of his creation, leaving his children behind. Deb is left behind with only Dex, who ultimately destroys her world.
Unfortunately this is Cryptic's way of promoting the sale of Zen to fund their Free to Play game.   Star Trek Online had a similar system and it was discovered that the items in question were not even being won,  the script just chooses a random name from the server and adds it to the text.  It was proven as some times you or your friends names would appear on this list when you clearly hadn't won anything.
hey folks,   i'm looking for a multi purpose (modular) backpack (system). i want to be able to fit all my belongings in there and be able to use it as carry on for flying, hiking, being able to get all my stuff in one trip from A to B and for daily usage (university, day trip, every day carry...).   i currently have a lowe alpine frontier 55+15, which presumably has 70 liters and a [thule crossover]( with 25 liters.   a modular system would be super, so that i can use a smaller pack for when i'm stationary at a place and just want to carry stuff for the day. my thule w/ 25 liters is my daily backpack, but anything bigger would be too big and a smaller module would be super.   thanks to /r/minimalism i can fit almost all my stuff in there, but i will be getting rid of more stuff, so that ~34 liters should hopefully be enough to fit all my belongings, that consist of clothes, 13" ultrabook, nook, camelbak, sleeping bag and dslr.   the  pro travel carry on . the [5.11 rush 24]( looks sweet, plus it has at least the ability to add additional smaller add ons, if i'm not mistaken.   really cool would be waist straps for carrying heavy loads and hiking and a camelbak outpout (rush 24 has that), to avoid zippers getting unzipped by movement.   i'm really really thankful for any help, i'm downsizing and this is an important foundation. i want one backpack that lasts a long time and that i can use for everything.
Okay, time to give the real low-down on Gamestop, because someone  has  to do it.   My background - employed for a long while (Years) in a relatively high volume area. We are in a district that makes "numbers," which basically means the stores around us do solid profit and we beat or match company standards on game reserves and PowerUp Rewards (Our discount card, for those uniformed) subscriptions. The store I work at, where I mainly work register, is a relatively busy store, and our numbers have put us in the very top tiers of the company on many occasions. Anyways...   So you walk into a Gamestop, and you probably get a greeting. As a retailer, you kind of form preset recordings that you welcome people with. For some, it's "Hey guys, how are you?" or in my case, it's "Hey everyone, how are we all doing today?" That's the first step for me - greeting. I don't do it with any alterior motive, really, I just like to welcome people, and this seems to be the case with any well rated store. So, if a GameStop employee seems overtly attentive with you right when you walk in, don't fall to cynicism - odds are they actually intend on helping.   But I know, I know - that's not what is grinding those gears of yours. It's when you get to that counter, and we ask those two wonderful questions. We'll do them one at a time.   First, we'll probably ask you about reservations - if you have any games coming out in the future that you want to reserve, and if you wanted to put down a $5 deposit (It is subtracted at the time of purchase.)   Now frankly, I think this is a pretty standard thing to ask a customer at a game store, and I used to have a hard time understanding the passionate fury that comes from people when asked about it. And then I had an associate that I personally believe is the worst associate possible - the kind that makes you hate people like me. He would, for all intents and purposes, hold customers hostage, stalling his ringing until they essentially caved. I talked to him about it afterwards, and he did show some remorse, but inevitably shrugged his shoulders - unfortunately this is part of the job.   You see, you need a certain percentage of your transactions to include a reserve. An associate on a bad day should be around 7-10 percent. On a good day, each associate could get almost 30 percent reservations, and I had on occasion gotten near the 60 percent mark for reservations in a standard shift. That's all fine and good, but take my word for it, it's much harder to get that 7 percent rather than that 60. And if you get that 7 percent for and extended period of days, you are urged to pick it up or you risk being written up. I've seen it happen, and very typically no one wants to initiate the penal system in the stores, but it risks having the even higher ups coming in and coming down way harder on everyone.   In this sense, reservations are a survival necessity. They are our wheat, our grain, etc. So when we seem pushy, realize that usually, we don't like being like that (I personally hate it, but I've found ways to ease the militant style and customers seem seriously appreciative.)   However, I know it's not the reservations that really get to you - sure, you'll want more games eventually, so those make sense. It's those damn discount cards that really make you want to kill us, isn't it? Here goes;   The PowerUp Rewards Card, be it the free edition or the subscription based "Pro" card are vital to the survival of the store and the employees. That's it, right there. Much like reserves, we need a certain percentage of customers to either get it, or have it when they come in. And trust me, these are way harder to do.   The Pro card is most likely the one we push - $14.99, 10% off of used games, etc. Ring any bells? Listen, we know - games are pricey and adding 15 more dollars is like getting a Prince Albert piercing by a Jeep Grand Cherokee, but when we push this, it isn't us trying to gouge you. Frankly, if you asked me, as a customer and not as an employee, I think the card is worth it, and it has saved me hundreds in the years I've had it. When I push it, I'm hoping you'll get it, but I can't speak for everyone in the company.   Getting a low card percentage typically can put you in hop water faster than any other criteria - on a bad day, you'll get 0 - 3 cards, maybe doing around 8 to 11 percent. On a good day, associates can sell up to 9 or 10 cards and get almost 40 percent. We try very hard for the latter, but it's much easier said than done.   These are the two biggest things it seems that are taken into account when evaluating an associate at GameStop. Someone with bad numbers will almost always, unless he/she is an insufferable shit or fucks something up, be the first to go.   So yes, there's nice GameStop employees, and no, we don't like pushing stuff on you - if we don't, we don't eat, it's simple as that. Is it all a bit detrimental to customer reaction? Obviously, or I wouldn't of written this all. So take it all into account when you talk to a nice Game Advisor, and do those customer service surveys at the bottoms of the receipts - they really do help us, more than you think.
Shotguns breaking the infantry game? Not as much as A2Am, no.   BASRs breaking the infantry game? No, unless you're MLG tier CQC infil. You're not.   Tank mines are far from breaking anything after the deployment shield.   MAXes themselves are a valid candidate, even Higby admitted in this interview that the designer for PS2 combat had identified them as a serious problem in terms of balance - that it "didn't belong".   Vulcan? Yeah, nerf that fuck, and this comes from someone who guns it a lot - it's no fair.   The whole concept of a skill-less weapon should NOT have any place in the airgame between ESFs, a highly skilled arena in which there is such an amazingly high skill ceiling. The devs have already tabled ideas that A2Ams be effectively useless against ESFs, but instead serve as the "heavy hitters" against libs and gals. I support their idea.
SPOILER ALERT  for anyone who has yet to play this game or its DLCs.   [Courier 6]( of the Mojave Express starts out as a simple delivery courier, delivering messages and packages across the wasteland that was at one time known as the Mojave Desert of Nevada, but is now the Mojave Wasteland of 2281.   For the purposes of this discussion, we will be assuming the Courier is maxed out in every stat, and at their peak in every way, at least in regards to what is possible in the game.   Feats : With the Main quest, important side quests, and DLC, and dialogue in mind, The Courier is stated to have traveled from as far as California, to Utah, to Nevada, to even Denver. By walking. In addition, the Courier has at most, convinced 2 factions that would today be the size of small countries to leave Nevada, as it is the Courier's territory now, kill the most influential and powerful person in all of New Vegas, Mr. House, and convince five different tribes/factions to assist the Courier in the creation of a new nation.   DLC   Dead Money : The Courier survives in a villa where their only allies are a mostly deranged super mutant, a mute woman, and an old world zombie singer. Also with a collar around the neck that explodes if too close to a radio. And poison gas that covers the entire villa which kills in seconds. And the [inhabitants]( which are feral humans who don't die until you cut their limbs off. Also the Courier survives this and then kills the guy who brought them there, freeing themselves, and stealing a lot of gold and money.   Honest Hearts : Later, the Courier walks to Utah, enters Zion Canyon, and assists two entire tribes in evacuating from their enemy tribe, the White Legs. Also has to survive the [wildlife]( Although to be totally honest, the Courier and [Joshua Graham]( a man who was set on fire, thrown off the Grand Canyon and survived, could have easily killed the White Leg tribe. They are given the choice not to because it would ruin the innocence of the Tribes they are trying to evacuate. The Courier either chooses to destroy the White Legs or convince Joshua to let them go, as if Joshua is not convinced, he goes on to kill the entire tribe.   Old World Blues : Later still, the Courier is abducted and taken to an old world laboratory where the best and brightest scientists in the old world researched new and innovative methods of winning the Great War, which caused the Fallout world to be the way it is. The Courier then battles corpses locked in suits that force them to kill others, [robotic scorpions]( with lasers for stingers and crusher claws, and a [bigger]( version of said robotic scorpions, which is strong enough to tank shots from the hand held mini nuke launcher. Oh right and brainless test subjects who have long since gone insane and have opted to kill the Courier. Also The Courier has been lobotomized, and is thus, brainless, spineless, and heartless. Which on the plus side, gives the benefits of being undetectable by enemy robots, immune to poisons and drug addiction, and can no longer be crippled and gives a permanent strength bonus. Although you do get the option to retrieve the original body parts at the end.   Lonesome Road : Lastly, the Courier enters  The Divide  soldiers called  marked men  and is assisted by robotic drones which heal him and hurt you. Also he wields an automatic 12.7mm submachinegun and behind the Courier are the marked men, who want to kill him. Anyways, the Courier, badass he is, wins and then either hacks into a computer and stops, redirects, or targets the major factions in the Mojave with enough nuclear missiles to damage the surrounding area for up to a century.   Durability : To give an idea of how many hits the Courier can take before going down, the game starts with the Courier being shot in the head twice at point blank range with a 9 millimeter handgun, being buried, and then dug up several hours later and then surviving the surgery with either no or little brain damage.   S.P.E.C.I.A.L. : Standing for Strength, Perception, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck respectively, the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system is the Fallout game's method for judging a character's overall stats. It maxes out at 10 for each, meaning it is impossible to have a perception of 11 and so on. If completely maxed the courier is able to:   Strength  to carry at most, 400 pounds of equipment, while still maintaining the ability to run and jump very quickly.  Outright intimidate most people as the Courier is strong enough to take on super mutants in unarmed combat and win.   Perception  that can detect hostiles long before they are in visual range, and assists in landing devastating shots on enemies.   Endurance  high enough to make fighting [deathclaws]( in close quarters combat survivable and winnable.   Charismatic  enough to intimidate [mercenaries]( that fighting the Courier would be worse than fighting almost 10 feet tall mutants with machineguns and rocket launchers. Or to convince an army general to take his entire army and leave the most strategically important device in the entire Mojave, Hoover Dam. Oh wait sorry, The Courier is able to do that TWICE.   Intelligent  enough to hack into U.S. Military grade computers, shut down hostile combat robots, and in general makes him one of, if not the smartest human in the entire wasteland in terms of common sense, knowledge, and wisdom.   Agility  allows the Courier to, with the help of the Pip-Boy 3000 computer on their wrist, entire a sort of [bullet-time]( trance to target enemies with lethal efficiency, draw a weapon in the [blink of an eye]( and does exactly what it implies: makes the Courier the fastest, most agile threat on the battlefield.   Luck  is one of the most important stats, maxed, the Courier is lucky enough to blind fire with a horrendously inaccurate weapon at enemies, and still score devastating hits, whereas the hostiles would constantly be missing and only scoring glancing hits. Most famously, Luck is used to gamble at the casinos and win so many times they forbid you from gambling. Can perform surgery without actually knowing anything and perform it successfully. Guess a password on the first try and get it right. Han Solo level luck.   Skills: Should a skilled player  max out his potential  he is capable of becoming the best sharpshooter, mechanic, survivalist, doctor, and locksmith. He is also a master at bartering, the handling of all types of energy weapons, melee weapons (extremely deadly with anything, from a sledgehammer to an industrial strength cutting torch) the use of explosives, one of the most intelligent and knowledgeable scientists in the world, sneaky enough that s/he is all but invisible, could convince almost anyone to do anything with a maxed out speech skill, and could beat just about anyone in unarmed fighting.   Equipment : The Courier is capable of acquiring and utilizing [power armor]( To give an idea of how strong Fallout power armor is, in lore, it was designed to replace main battle tanks for the United States. It was extremely successful. Not only that, there are other armors, [Riot armors]( which are light enought o allow the user to remain agile and have built in nightvision, but are still very much bulletproof and durable. He gains access to the [Tesla cannon]( which can disintegrate anything in one shot, or if it can't, it badly scorches it. [Hand-held nuke launchers]( [missile lauchers]( [gatling guns]( .50 caliber AM rifle, plasma and laser rifles/pistols/artillery pieces, [grenade launchers/machine guns]( flamethrowers, [Arc welders]( time bombs, landmines, C-4, chainsaws, knives, swords, spears, Throwing axes that destroy robots on contact, a sword that is on fire and coated with gasoline, piston based power fists, a thermic lance, a railgun, and so much more. Also as mentioned before, if the Courier is maxed, the Courier is a master at using every single one of those weapons I mentioned, and many more, those were just the most powerful ones that come to mind. Also he gets a drum fed fully automatic [rocket launcher]( at the end of Lonesome Road, so there's that.   Miscellaneous : Should the Courier opt to (which we will say s/he will as this is a peak courier) the Courier has the opportunity to become a cyborg. As in, purchase [cybernetic implants]( that increase every S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat by one. Then proceed to buy implants that allow accelerated regeneration from even the most grievous wounds, and strengthen the skin to the point of where while its not bulletproof, the Courier's skin is now durable enough to take hits that would normally leave bruises and cuts and now show no noticeable damage at all. Furthermore, if the Courier travels to the Big MT, they receive Implants that allow them to move much faster while sneaking, remove radiation from drinking contaminated water, and regenerate from wounds and replenish adrenaline when simply eating food. Oh right, and a bonus damage stat against cazadores, the mutated wasps that can kill a grown man with one sting. In addition, through other side quests, the Courier has seen some truly horrific things, from an isolated community being told they had to elect to kill one of them or they'd all die, to fighting abominations like the [nightstalker]( [cazadore]( deathclaw, tunneler, marked men, ghost people, and more. Courier 6 by the end of the game should the player take both violent and diplomatic methods, killed thousands of armed soldiers, aforementioned abominations, and much worse. It is a wonder that s/he is not afflicted with PTSD after all they have been through, yet the Courier fights on.   Side note: The Hostile life forms of the wasteland are nothing to laugh it. The vast majority of people on earth today don't have a chance in hell at surviving a single week. I mean, aside from fire  breathing geckos , [giant scorpions]( with nigh bulletproof carapaces and fatal stings, and [feral ghouls]( they'd still have to contend with living in what amounts to the Mojave Desert. Except now with more gamma radiation, more bandits, less safe communities, and other horrific fates that await the unaware in the wasteland.   Super Mutants  also deserve an honorable mention. A long time ago before the war, a company called West-Tek was hired by the United States government to produce bioweapons. One of which was called FEV, forced evolutionary virus. It transformed humans into things like [this]( or [this]( The newly christened super mutants were formed in some remote locations in the midwest, but more notably, the east and west coast. Although the East coast variants suffered from a decrease in overall intelligence, the ones the courier encounters are of the West coast variety.   The West coast super mutants are strong enough to tank entire magazines of ammunition, wrench the gun out of whoever fired at them, and beat them to death with it. They are also insanely smart, moreso than a regular human. They are in general far more capable at enduring injuries, and their physical strength is easily five times that of a human, even strong ones, and are considered to be a massive threat to even veterans.   Unless of course, you're motherfucking Courier Six, in which case, if you so desire, you get the option to take down an entire army of super mutants twice, once at Black Mountain, and once at Jacobstown.   Admittedly, the average wastelander would only really encounter half those things, but the Courier meets  swarms  of all of them, and wins every time.   Remember the deathclaws? To put things in perspective, in lore standards, T-51B Power Armor is strong enough that a single soldier wearing it was strong enough to take on military occupied camps and teams could slaughter bases with very little difficulty.   A Deathclaw could cut power armor soldiers in half with  one strike .   Oh right, and to add to feats, at one point in the game, The Courier, alone, walks into a massive quarry that's filled with at least 20 deathclaws, an alpha deathclaw, a mother deathclaw and her babies, and he doesn't win, he  destroys  them. It wasn't even a contest. If you so wished, a player could do it unarmed, and still win.   [ Oh right, and perks ]( Some of the best perks in the game include solar powered, which regenerates HP in sunlight and makes the Courier much stronger, Grim Reaper's sprint, which means the more people you kill the faster you get in combat, Rad absorption, even if severely poisoned with gamma radiation, the Courier loses this radiation rapidly over time. Is smart enough to take tin cans and scrap metal and create bullets out of them, gains MASSIVE amounts of health if he has good karma and is level 50, gains yet another cybernetic implant, this one is not addictive and allows for bullet time. Extremely versatile and can be activated at a moment's notice.   I would post pictures of what my character looks like, but due to mods my Courier is about 6'8" And has way more perks is way over the max level limit. So are the enemies but I don't want to spread false information.
I was a chubby, bespectacled, gingery blonde book nerd who grew up as an only child with zero social skills and a lot of "everyone is nice" naivety, which only made the bullying worse. Between high school and college, I learned how to let the curly red hair fly, used sunscreen to keep my paleness, got contacts for some days and nice librarian glasses for others, and inched into wearing more formfitting clothes that expressed me (I used to try to "hide" in big hoodies and the like). Also lost some weight and grew taller, although that was more in high school. Let my freak flag fly with playing music, nerdiness, metal, books, etcetera. Made real friends.   In my sophomore year (junior now) at the big uni where I and many others from my elementary/high school go, four (I counted) boys who used to bully the shit out of me hit on me. Three of them didn't recognize me.     Horrendously unpopular. Isolated is probably the better word.     Right at the beginning of freshman year - with people from high school, not until I met them again randomly     More friends/socialization/people willing to come up and chat. I guess I don't have a problem being rejected by the guys or girls I like, but I am more in search of awesome people to be around than boy/girlfriends. However, I'm really put off by how upfront and brazen some people are about sheer attraction. Creepy, man.     No. I, myself, am an introvert. If anything, I question people's motives more now.     Not the ones that I like to hang out with.     Yes, if only for being more confident in my own shoes. I also treat what I wear as my personal canvas, and it works, and it's awesome.
I'm fairly certain this is a bug with wattman but I've set the GPU to 800mv with memory on auto and it doesn't care (the VDDC shows as 1.125-1.150 on GPUZ).   I tested this theory by  undervolting  my memory with the stock GPU and 2250 mem:  - this was stable and showing around 120w average GPU draw.   It seems pretty much every review would have had VDDC locked at max??   I'm trying to OC the GPU now and i've had to bump the memory up to 1030 to achieve 1350mhz (1150mv) - still tweaking; this seems like the same thing voltage wise but GPU-Z now states 1.1187-1.125 under load, which is slightly lower and no spikes over 1.15 (and idles at the memory voltage 1.025)   edit  - seems like with the memory OC'd you cant push the GPU that hard before reaching 165w+ and you start to see artifacts... damnit why did I buy a reference GPU :(   edit2  - i can run 1325/2250 all day which can draw upto 180w so I think the core clock artifacts might just be VRM cooling?   1325/2250 firestrike:   edit3  - pretty much stuck with the reference cooler now at 1345/2250:   Heres firestrike:   As adored aluded to in his power video, the RAM seems to be the power issue?
Moved out to Ottawa a couple months or so now, still don't have a hookup. Throughout the last two weeks my nights have consisted of me going to the parks in the nepean area looking for fellow ents. Not so much luck it's seemed, almost seemed to be the case that not a person around was into trees or comfortable admitting to a stranger that they smoke. Anyways last night went a bit differently, ran into a couple guys who were kind enough to help me out. They explained they were from out of town so they had no local hookups but were more than kind to give me a small bit of their personal stash. Props to you two, made my night honestly.   Anyways I headed home with my golden ticket to a good night, got home busted out my new vape (Ordered it anticipating a hookup by now, was hoping to conserve my bud with it as I had heard vapes can be rather economical) Anyway I poured what I was given into the vape, it filled it perfectly. I started up the vape, let it heat up and took my first hit from it. Tasty. A few hits later and the vapes auto off feature kicked in, and I was already sitting at a solid [5]. Off the tiniest bit of weed! And it didn't stop there. I shortly started up the vape again, and kept taking hits. This shit is delicious. It was great to be high again. Made a big meal at around an [8] and after made an edible with the avb. A couples hours of playing some league with my buddy in the army and I realize I'm skating through at a solid [9.9]. Fast forward to today, I'm waking up still a bit high. Shits good. Coming from someone who almost only smoked joints, this vape was a game changer. Want to thank the ents who helped me out again, made my night.
My 19th birthday, I tell a couple friends hey, lets go for a hike. We plan this adventure for like 2 months, and its a week long camping trip in the middle of West Virginia. When we get there, it rains a solid three days up to my birthday, I end up getting soaked to the bone, on the point of hypothermia and almost dying (almost). My friends (we're all eagle scouts) kept a good watch over me on my hypothermic day (my birthday) and we spent the next three days trudging through the mud to meet at the rendezvous spot to get picked up. None of them remembered why we went on the trip until my dad asked how my birthday went.
My bf and I are close to approaching our first year together and its gotten very serious. He's a great match for me except for one problem: he's taking wayyyy longer than he promised to quit smoking.   I'm not disgusted by smoking but I AM terrified for him, his health, and his confidence. He wants to stop smoking as much as he wants that cigarette fix. Its a vicious cycle and heartbreaking to watch.   He's got history with nicotine: his father quit only 2 years ago, and he began chewing tobacco with his buddies in high school to cut weight for wrestling   He smokes about 2-3 cigarettes a day and 4-5 if he's stressed or anxious. We agreed that he would start to detox in the fall, but its already been a month and he's still smoking.   I get the feeling he's scared to quit.
Hey everyone, 22F here.  Contrary to everything, I am a cheerful, level-headed individual who enjoys social situations.  I love to laugh and get to know people.  My friends have told me before that people listen to me,  I "open up a room", and that I have charisma.   I guess I would agree with this, unless it involves someone I am attracted to.  I then proceed to become very nervous and over-think my actions, wonder how I look etc etc.  When my friends are egging me on to talk to that guy, I just say, "gosh, people like him don't really look at people like me", so on and so forth.  I basically think this guy is out of my league, and spoil my chances of ever talking to him because I am afraid of rejection, and believe that he wouldn't have been interested anyway,   If it helps, more background info:     I am pretty tiny.  About 5'1, of Asian descent.  People have called me cute; I guess I'm alright looking.     The guy isn't like a Brad Pitt looking dude, but he is decently cute, and really tall.     I don't go for those cocky, know-it-all, "I am god's gift to women" boys - I actually am very attracted to intelligence, ambition, kindness, and artistically/musically inclined men.
I never had a hero my whole life, and I think I missed out on a lot because of it.   Growing up in a rural area with minimal parental guidance or worldly education/exposure, there wasn't much to really aspire me.  Then boarding school I got a bit more exposure, but I was a naive young kid focused on study.  Then I got too old and bitter with the world through working customer service in fast food and the over sensationalizing of news media to look up to anyone.  The over saturation of famous people doesn't help either.  It is hard to follow someone throughout their career since most people are in the spot light/relevant for more than a year or two.
copied from wiki:   ASRock was originally spun off from Asus in 2002 in order to compete with companies like ECS and Foxconn for the commodity OEM market. Since then, however, ASRock has also gained momentum in the DIY sector and plans for moving the company upstream began in 2007 following a successful IPO on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.[1] ASRock has garnered a reputation for good value (cost/performance) from tech websites,[2] including awards and recommendations for an array of products.[3][4]   ASRock is currently owned by Pegatron Corporation.[5][6]

So I'm in the car with my little brother ( user: stonerboner1234) and a friend of ours (non redditor but still an ENT) and we're casually driving around smoking a spliff, and ashing out the windows. Life is good at about a [7]. We pull into the mall parking lot to pick up some food when a faint, smokey smell came from somewhere in the car. We all ignored it thinking it was just someone who was having a barbecue. Thirty seconds later that was no longer the case. smoke was filling the car and something was not right. I looked in my rear view mirror and I could see a faint orange glow coming from the trunk space (I drive a scion xb) and I scream "HOLY FUCKING SHIT MY FUCKING CAR IS ON FIRE" so my buddy in the back frantically turns around and pulls a sock out of my backseat that had totally erupted into flame, stating "HOLY FUCK THIS SOCK IS ON FIRE" while flinging the still burning sock out of the window into the parking lot. Turns out that during our smoke, the ember flew off the spiff, out the front window, through the back window, into the trunk space where it landed perfectly on an old sock I forgot back there, causing it to catch flame. The sock was surrounded with old papers from school that were scorched but not burning. We laughed about our dumb luck after and proceed to light one up! Stay safe ENTs!
Throwaway here. Some friends know my real account blah blah. Anyway, I'll keep it brief, just need some direction because I have never been in this situation before.   I've been with my SO for 3 years, and she's great and all, but everything is just boring with her now, lackluster sex, never shows enthusiasm to do anything, anytime I suggest to do something I'll get a faint "okay," and I always feel she would rather be doing something else, but never suggests what to do, or she'll give me ideas of things, then she'll follow it up with "... but its whatever you want to do." As if shes waiting for me to pick the wrong thing so she can justify why she's bored. I don't know if I'm even physically and mentally attracted to her anymore.   It's getting to the point in the relationship to move in together, looking for a house, but I'm the only one doing the work. Going to mortgage broker, realtor, setting up times, etc. I feel as if she's just looking to move out of her place and tag along with me without any real expense. I usually end paying for 80% of our meals/booze, and when she does offer, its usually a small bill.   She has a good job, always willing to drive to my place, and very friendly and sociable, but I just don't "feel" it anymore. I really can't complain about her per se. We bicker and have mini arguments but nothing explosive. It's just becoming a chore to be around her sometimes. Is this normal for a relationship in its 3rd year? We have talked about marriage and all that stuff. It's just the idea of being with her the rest of my life is terrifying, and same goes for breaking up with her.   A couple years before I met her, I started exercising more and getting in shape, getting more confident in social settings, being a better version of me I suppose. When I met her, she was I guess the first person to give me more attention then I was used to, it was great and fun, she was into me, and I guess she still is in a sense, but its not the same. I'm bored.   I guess having a gf makes talking to other girls even easier, because I have nothing to lose if they don't want to talk to me. However there have been a few instances where I know girls were flirting with me, and if I were single I would have asked them out in a heartbeat. Especially now, I run into this new girl maybe twice a week. I've only known her for maybe almost 2 months now, but we chit chat and seems interested in to what I have to say, (can't talk too much, we're both on the clock, and no I don't work with her). The other day she told me I smelled nice with a smile while playing with her hair, she doesn't know that I have a gf. If I were single I would have asked her out shortly after our conversation, and this girl is a beautiful, smart, and in shape, and every conversation felt fluid, genuine and refreshing.   I'm just confused about these feelings. I know I shouldn't have them, and I would never cheat on my GF. Is it normal to crush on other people while you're in a relationship? Has anyone ever gone over that barrier and broke up with a long term SO to be risk trying something out with someone else? Was it worth it or do you still regret it? Some people will probably think I'm an asshole for posting/asking this. I just need clarity in a time where everything is cloudy.
I am not an expert on this subject, and do not care to back any of this up with sources. This is merely what I understand from several years of casual, hobby-reading.   They are different. The Chinese Navy is purpose-built for anti-access to the US navy in case of an attack on Taiwan. The US Navy is incredibly powerful on many fronts. China cannot compete with these, so it has chosen to strategically develop those areas where the US Navy is lacking.   It is this reason that instead of making smart missiles, China prefers to just stockpile thousands. The US Navy could, perhaps, shoot down a single missile, or develop technology to shoot down a single advanced missile. It cannot develop technology to shoot down 1000. It is also for this reason that China is building the aircraft carrier killer missile. The US relies on aircraft carriers. It will be difficult for the US to exercise proper control over an area without air superiority, and air superiority will be difficult when its aircraft carriers have to be situated 1000 km outside the Chinese coast. China is also relatively advanced in submarine warfare. A lot of espionage against the US military has been focused on submarines, specifically, and unlike the Chinese airforce, the Navy has been much more successful in making advanced submarines. Submarine warfare is something that is especially difficult to protect against, and China has a lot of submarines. It has also successfully snuck up on US carrier groups, undetected, during training exercises.   The Chinese military is primarily built to make it infinitely expensive, if not impossible, for the US to maintain long-term control over any Chinese territory.   Where does Japan enter into this equation? Japan does not have an attack military. It has a self-defense military. Japan has very little ability to project power. However, their defensive capabilities are world-class. Japan has some of the most advanced anti-submarine and anti-mine capabilities in the world, which will surely hamper any efforts by China to sneak up on anyone near the first island chain. Japan cannot attack China, it is impossible. China also cannot attack Japan, because Japan is essentially an unsinkable fortress.
I'm in university and last term I made friends with a Japanese exchange student [21 M]. We kicked it off well and he introduced me to his girlfriend A [22 F, same as title], a girl he had gotten to know on exchange here. Things were going well and I was supposed to visit him in Japan in early May. A wasn't going back to Japan until today. My friend told me to take her out to see more things while she still had time in my country.   However, A texted me early this month to tell me that he had gotten into an accident and passed away. I immediately spoke to her and took her out to make sure she was okay. On the whole she had begun to make plans for the future, as painful as that might have been for her.   My concern for A has escalated into a daily pining for her; a sort of need to speak to her and know that she's getting better.   What's tricky is that I'm going on exchange to Japan soon and she will most likely be my go-to friend for any help. I'm afraid the proximity to her may strengthen any feelings I may have.   I have a girlfriend [19 F] whom I've been together for a year, who only knows vaguely that I am friends with A and that I'm helping her through the grieving stages. But I feel terrible that I'm keeping her in the dark about all this.   I also feel like I'm dishonouring my friend's memory with these feelings. He's barely been gone for about a month, and I'm supposed to be looking out for his girlfriend, not going after her.
In response to monte's idea that the rules placed in the ogn/ lpl should be honored atleast in regards to age is ridiculous. If anything this is truly the fault of the league organizers in this case the ogn, as well as the organization that runs the lpl. Because these organizations have permision to run tournments or leagues on their own when they lease the rights from riot, they can then make their own rules for their tournaments, however riot runs their own leagues and make their own set of rules. These rules are followed by na/eu lcs teams and are in place for specific reasons. So why is it that the na and eu teams/leagues/players should be punished on the international stage in a riot run tournament. If this was a lpl or ogn run world tournament fine make the rule for 16+, but it is not a ogn or lpl tourney and therefore they should have to adapt to the situation. The fact this is even an issue is eastern bias from monte as well as ogn and lpl pandering to team organizations in their respective regions.
I've been dealing with some strong feelings lately.   My girlfriend and I had been together for several months before a job opportunity came her way and she wanted to move back to one of her childhood homes. I supported her, and we agreed to stay a long-distance couple. This worked for several months, but ultimately neither her nor I were willing to make the commitment to sacrifice career to move away from our respective homes so we mutually decided to end things.   We stayed in close communication following the split, even driving several hours to visit each other three months post-breakup. I expressed my interest in wanting to find a compromise; to try things again. She wouldn't commit, saying she was "Scared we can't build because the foundation may be cracked."   As the months went on the feelings didn't fade as we stayed in touch, but one day I saw online she was dating someone else. I knew it would happen eventually, but I thought it best I cut communication for my own sanity. I was very open to her about my reasoning and my feelings throughout all this. She respected my choice.   A month later I received an unexpected message from her: she wanted to explore the possibility of her moving back to be with me. As joyous as I was, I knew there would be an uphill battle to get back to the level we once were at. However, as anyone who has been in love can understand, it's something worth fighting for.   Things are going as good as possible; being long distance. We're both taking steps to prepare for her eventual move and have an upcoming weekend planned together.   I view intimacy as quite sacred; a manifestation of a deep connection between two people. I know she has a different perspective of sex, and has had far more partners than I have, which I was comfortable with when we started dating.   But I needed to know about the period when we broke-up, so I asked over skype (since I know when she's here in person it will be tough to keep my hands off her and bringing it up then would ruin the mood). She admitted, perhaps reluctantly, to sleeping with five guys in the months we were apart. She wasn't sorry for doing it, but she did apologize if she hurt me in any way.   I had planned for the worst, but I still felt that sinking feeling. I had also had sex with another woman in our time apart, though it was after I had cut off communication with my ex. I don't think I would have been able to make an intimate connection with someone else while being hung up on her, at least not a healthy one.   I don't regret asking about the subject, as I believe truth is important in a relationship and will ultimately find more peace with reality than any fantasy.   My issue now is the remaining jealousy. I find myself wondering more morbid details, how soon after we broke up did she start hooking up with people, were they able to please her, who were these guys...   This could be a self-esteem issue, as our breakup was definitely a blow to my ego. And while I dealt with our split by expressing my sadness and frustration by writing (and occasional heavy-drinking), she found comfort in physical intimacy. To each their own... though I wish her way wasn't so damaging to me.   Rant over! I do appreciate any feedback. I try to keep a logical head most of the time, but being in love... it doesn't make sense.   UPDATE - She claimed to always use protection and has been tested twice. Everything clean; not an issue.
If the videos aren't on photostream, you may be SOL...the only other thing I can think of is using digital forensics software, you may be able to retrieve the videos if the phone hasn't already overwritten the area they were stored.   Basically, in theory, if you turned your phone off right after this happened, you could power it back on, turning off wifi, turning on airplane mode, and mount the phone storage as a drive on the computer, open the drive with a forensics tool (think backtrack linux for a freeware forensics suite), and then rebuild the links from the videos that are now "in limbo".   The reason data is retrievable this way is because when a file is "deleted" it isn't gone, it just has the link to it removed and the data still exists in the memory until it is overwritten by something else. When something needs to be secure wiped, it generally is overwritten numerous times to ensure no previous data is recoverable.
I guess, best way to check is to wait for a reply. If they reply and ask you to talk with them over another website or to click on anything, don't. It's a bot. On that same note, if the pic is too good to be true, it's prolly someone trying to get money off you via webcam etc. (again, bot).   You might have pic collectors as well that will use the photos you give to them for use against other potential 'customers', if you will. Hope this helps
So my ex-wife and I have kids together (joint custody, married for 10 years, divorced since 2007). I get the children 2 weekends a month. I am also with a new woman(together since 2010) and we are set to be married on the 9th of August.   My Fiancé and I hit a rough patch a month ago and while I was dropping the kids of at their mother's house I mentioned I was stressed. She claimed she wanted to discuss child support out in the garage - but then began to come onto me sexually. (She is recently divorced again). It had been a couple of weeks since I had sex and got caught up in the moment and we ended up having unprotected sex in the garage.   Now this last weekend I dropped the kids off and she now says she is pregnant and claims it is my child. I believe that it couldn't be due to her claim that she "just missed her period and took the test" but she did have a physical test to show me. I do know in the past she is known to hook up with random guys using tinder and the bar. She just wants me to be the daddy to kid #4.   And to add to all of this my wedding is in 3 weeks and I don't know what I should do. I know I should tell my fiancé everything, but I don't want to stress her about the pregnancy that I know is false - but what if my daughter (16) tells her? I don't know how I would deal with that.
Again, going to try to be constructive about it and describe what I think of it as well as minor tweaks.     It "clashes" too much, you go from a white and blue bord to a high color real image board with tonnes of pictures with all different backgrounds,     Solution  Cutting down the amount of celebs is a first and easy solution, another would be to maybe make them as drawn black and white or sketched pictures so they don't become like a neon sign hoging attention, at least change the backgrounds on the pictures, at this point the random coloring is interfering with ther stuff, such as the short link.     The content itself is honestly a bit dull, just short celebs make it seem like it's something it's not     Solution  Cut back on the amount of celebs or change theme entirely, add some historical character, preferably some one every one knows like Napoleon the great, Alexander the great etc. to create more difference between them, as of no it just looks like a modern article with modern people and some of them are just really random and barely known, like that blonde girl. I think an image should speak for itself and it should not need a text that describes it, a tex should add to it but this image itself does not really speak and describe this sub to be honest. Maybe some kind of motto like they have in game of thrones for houses (UNbent unbowed unbroken, our blades (downvotes) are sharp etc.)
I have already submitted this to R*...of course I was met with the standard automated reply. Fair enough they have bigger issues on their plate, but for me this is entirely game breaking.   I am in an MC crew. We roll around on our bikes..chill out...and occasionally cause chaos.   Last night one of our brothers was being griefed. So he had called a few of us over to his session. Not before long, we had 7 of our crew in there rolling towards him on our Baggers/Hexers/Daemons.   Oh the sight of 7 patched brothers rolling down the highway...glorious   We converge on where our poor brother is taking cover being griefed by 3 other players. This guy is only level 4, and a prospect. But we still look after our own. The 3 other players are levels 42/68 and 112.   Needless to say a massive gunfight erupts. We swarm all over them. I go off radar, sneak up on one target and pulverise him with my Baseball Bat.   In the midst of the battle...we end up killing our own brothers...due to this stupid targeting system.   We slow down a bit and now try and position ourselves spaced out in a line...so targeting would be easier. But the spawning makes this difficult so we are now forced to check the name and map of target before we fire.   This is crucial loss of time, and mostly we get killed as the time it takes to check a target is all it takes for the enemy to kill us. And they wouldnt care who they are targeting, as we do, and the odds are in their favor in this regard.   Additional to this, the cops are swarming all over and our brothers dont stop for nothing. Now we are fighting Police AND Griefers. This makes the targeting even MORE difficult.   Satisfied they had learned their lesson, we all jumped on our bikes and rode off to the Tavern to throw back some Pisswassers.   Hopefully something is fixed soon. Crew and Friends should NOT be able to be targeted in the AA system. At least an option should be available to turn friendly fire on and off..
The List:   Here is my submitted list to the currently ongoing [Cube Contest]( hosted by Wizards, and I would love some feedback on how I did. I consider myself a pretty average Magic player who's only played Cube a couple of times it's been on MTGO, but I had tons of fun designing a thematic cube for the first time. Even if I don't get selected I would like the chance to share my attempt.   I posted my 500 word summary in the Blog page in the Cubetutor link, but here's the
Been lifting for a couple of months, but I'm getting serious this month. Started doing SL5x5 and stretch at home at night (always did before working out) to help fix my posture and get better form in my squats. One of the main things I see people use is foam rollers, but wich one is best? The ones with a smooth texture or the uneven ones?   Pictures for reference:
I did this when I was 5. Except they were all drawn on printer paper (and poorly, I might add). I had all 151 pictures taped on the wall, and one day my mom said they needed to be taken down, because that was the guest room, and her friend was going to stay a few nights. She put all the pictures away and that was that.   UNTIL YEARS LATER. I was around 8 or 9 and was on a huge Pokemon binge. I asked if she remembered those pictures and she goes "Of course!" We looked for that entire day, and came to the conclusion that she threw them out. My little heart was broken. She also threw out my Yu-Gi-Oh cards. My deck was amazing (by 7 year old standards).
I suppose you mean the ring that is inside the catacombs. A member of the darkmoons died there. It could be that the darkmoon would want to get the rite of kindling which was stolen from Nito, so they could get closer to linking the fire. Remember that Gwyndolin wants to keep the illusion of Anor Londo alive untill the Age of Fire is back in full power. Kindling is a big part of the Age of Fire. That's my guess.
Super long story short, I am hugely morbidly obese, homeless and stuck in a large hospital. I am up walking around(amazingly), and we are utilizing my extended stay as a place for rehab. (Dr. is fucking AMAZING)   I do require help with hygeine and ass wiping.   However lately the wiping is not enough as some staff has began to do a dab  instead of a good old wipe, I know it sucks, I feel terribly for requiring their help as it is BUTT....   How do I respectfully ask for a better wipe? How could I approach it without seemingly like an ungrateful bastard? or telling them they aren't "doing their job correctly"?   I have lost over 40lbs in 9 days and making super progress for a huge life change.   The staff is amazing, and helpful and I am really sincerely appreciative.   Help me help you RN's and Techs of REDDIT.
I'm happy for Notch and all of the success he's earned, but seeing this only further proves something I've been resenting for quite a while. I've loved Minecraft since the Alpha, but does anyone else get the feeling that the updates and work that goes into the game nowadays just isn't...right?  And not to mention all of this merchandising...Minecraft for Xbox, and now freakin' LEGO's? I feel as though Minecraft has gone from a good-natured, honestly fun project to just another money-milking corporation.  And I don't like that.  I don't like that one bit.  This is probably the wrong place to post this, and I will undoubtedly get downvoted, but I just had to get this out. :/
In relation to that thread (btw, thanks for all the replies):   I'd like to ask you guys&gals a couple of more questions, as I don't have faith in doctors in my country...   First of all, I'm a little confused. On some sites I read things like these: "Once the HPV virus enters your body, it remains there. Sometimes it is latent." (   On some other I read: "HPV usually goes away on its own, without causing health problems. So an HPV infection that is found today will most likely not be there a year or two from now. "   So, which one is it? Also, let's say that I break off with my girlfriend today (we're having problems, not related to this). After two years I meet a lovely girl, do I understand correctly that:     I should tell her that I used to have HPV, but it's probably gone     She should get vaccinated, just in case     If she gets vaccinated & we use protection most of the time, she'll be safe?       BTW. This is the cancerogenic HPV we're talking here btw.   More questions:     What are the chances of a woman with cancerogenic HPV getting the actual cancer?     I never gave my (current) gf oral. Now, that we found out about the disease, do I have a legitimate reason to not do it? I'd imagine that the virus still didn't get to my throat, but it will if we have oral sex. Is that right?
I'm fairly convinced there are two strains of Aspergers; the one you're born into and the one that is caused by N parents. Kind of related to the old but not entirely disproved theory that Aspergers is caused by frigid mothers.   Personal anecdotical theory only but my psychologist has implied this dual-strain theory is plausible and said that I am certainly a non-textbook Asperger who keeps shifting to/flirting with things that shouldn't be anywhere on the spectrum depending on how I'm doing and how much I trust the people I'm with.   She did say that to "turn" Aspergers you do have to be "vulnerable" to that kind of "shift", but it's definitely not unheard of that (A)CoNs shift into a broad range of disorders including things that can also be congenital.   Basically ACoNs are at high risk of having actual, physical brain damage from psychological abuse, which could most likely mimic congenital abnormalities in the brain.   **
All depends, do the fit your frame? What I mean is if you're a petite girl and you get enormous chesticles put in, that is a turn off for me. It's your body and if they make you feel better about yourself, who am I to judge. However, they are just a turnoff when they are ridiculously oversized your body.
Sorry if this ends up being a long post, I just need some advice.   Background: My high school boyfriend and I have been together for over 7 months now, and our relationship is great. He's funny and random, so I'm always laughing with him. We've had a few problems, but never any major fights, as we communicate well.   There are some things that I don't know how to discuss with him. One of them is him working out. He's not overweight at all, but he doesn't really have any muscle tone either. He's 5'11, and pretty skinny.   He spends the majority of his spare time playing video and computer games, which doesn't bother me at all. It's not like he's a forever alone type nerd, the nerdiness is really cute.   That's where the problem comes in. Everything about him is "cute." I don't want him to bulk up a lot, I actually think some guys can over-do the muscles. Think Andrew Garfield in Spiderman, not Channing Tatum, haha. (I'm pretty nerdy too, haha.)   I do yoga and a light work out every night, so I'm fairly toned. No defined muscle, just tight, I guess. I don't really know what to call it :P   This is definitely NOT a make-it or break-it in our relationship. I love him for who he is, and bicep size will never change how I feel about him, haha.   I guess what I'm asking is advice on how to bring this up to him. He can be kinda sensitive, and has made a few comments that make it seem like he's a little insecure. I don't want to hurt his feelings in any way, and I also don't want to seem shallow.   And if any guys have gone through similar experiences, I'd love to hear about it. Thanks for reading!
The dorm that I stayed in during my freshman year of college was on the 13th floor of what was once a hotel. Before school even started and before I moved into my dorm, I had heard stories about the ghost that haunts the building. He is affectionately called The Shuffler, and his signature is a traveling sound similar to shuffling feet/hands sliding along your walls. A few months after I had finally moved in and got settled, everyone had had their experience with The Shuffler (nothing too horrifying, but unsettling nonetheless).   One night at about 4 in the morning, my roommate, her girlfriend and I all woke up to the sound of our huge free-standing metal closet banging violently for short periods of time over and over again (sounded similar to repeatedly slamming a filing cabinet shut). We frantically closed the window and turned off the fan in hopes that the banging was caused by a draft or possibly changes in the air pressure. It happened for another half hour and we finally called our CF (community facilitator, basically just an RA). She came in with a high heeled shoe ready to stab the rodent or creature that was trying to get out. By now we were all screaming so loudly that most of the kids in my hall were cuddled under our blankets on our beds watching the madness (one of the kids was crying and crossing himself). The door was finally opened and nothing came out, so we all kind of sighed and forgot about it.   A few minutes later after the door was closed again, we heard the banging once more and everyone immediately ran out of the room leaving me, my CF (who has been putting up with this for 2 years already and claims to have the power to tell the Shuffler to leave) my roommate, and her girlfriend to deal with this shit.   I finally had the  brilliant  idea to duct tape the door closed and put a little post-it note with a cross on it (making fun of the situation so I could maybe be able to fall asleep in that room again). We all turned off the lights, closed our eyes, and the banging continued. I turned my light back on, and for the first time actually saw the movement happening - the tape was wiggling, the door handle was moving, and the stuff we had stacked on top of the cabinet was sliding around a little bit.   After that, the Shuffler jokes were no longer funny and I  never  once slept in that room by myself without the light and TV on ever again. It also took a lot of courage to look in my bathroom mirror thinking that I would see him standing behind me.
I had a threesome with my coworker and a close friend of mine [F21] about two years in to my relationship with my boyfriend and kept it a secret. After that, my coworker and I kept drunkenly hooking up sporadically over the past year. Most of those hook ups would be after a night of drinking with our other coworkers and he'd bring me back to his house and we'd have sex. I broke it off for a couple of months and then we started up again. All the while, I never said anything to my boyfriend.   Eventually, we started having a semblance of feelings for each other, he more than me (ie he would ask me out to dinner or ask me when he could properly take me out and I would leave as soon as I could or just kind of dodge the question) and so I stopped it once and for all - hooray!   I still want to be friends/on talking terms with my coworker and be able to talk to them (I like them as a person and I still work with them) but he's not talking to me. Also my boyfriend is none the wiser.   What do I do?
Ah.  Then I should not have jumped down your throat.   God damnit, I seriously need to get paid for this, for fuck's sake.   Ok, here's the deal.  You've made a mistake, but its a high quality mistake, so I can't fault you too badly.  In the late 1990s, the idea of Neanderthal Homo sapien interbreeding started cropping up because there was starting to be a lot of  archeological  evidence for it, and it just  seemed  very likely.  The anatomical differences were not so much that it would seem even wrong.   Now, they needed to do genetic testing to confirm this, but nucleic genetic testing is a lot more complicated, expensive, and the techniques did not come on line as fast as Mitochondrial DNA testing.  Mitochondrial DNA is the intact DNA that you get solely from your mother.  So there is a lot less variation of mtDNA, and thus is does not follow the same statistical models as nucleic DNA, and so it was hard to make definitive statements about what we should expect to find among them.  Ok, so the entire Human mtDNA range was determined, and then a sample of Neanderthal mtDNA was sequenced and the result was: no match.  I.e., Neanderthal had a common ancestor but accumulated its own mutations independently of Homo sapiens.  But the key is that this is only along the matrilineal line.  What this proves is that there is no Neanderthal mother -> mother -> mother -> ... -> mother -> modern human in existence.  That is to say, if we were interbreeding, then the Neanderthal women, or the Homo sapien-Neanderthal women offspring were unsuccessful at continuing to have children.  It actually says nothing about the other combinations.   However, some people nevertheless extrapolated this result to suggest that the other combinations were just as unlikely to have had long term propagation.  That's basically reflected in the link you gave.   Since that time, the human genome was completed.  That includes the nucleic DNA from Homo sapiens.  Now nucleic DNA is very different from mtDNA.  It doesn't come intact from your parents, but rather is a mixture between them.  So the genetic inferences have to be done differently than with mtDNA.   In 2010, [in a land mark paper]( Svante Paabo and many others in his large team finally extracted about 60% of the  nucleic  DNA from a Neanderthal.  When they tested  these  genes against humans they found that they matched against non-African Homo Sapiens about 2.5% more than they matched against Africans.  Follow-up studies have confirmed this result.   Now the point is -- this is basically impossible unless there has been interbreeding.  If they just shared a common ancestor with us, then they should be exactly equidistant (in a genetic sense) from the vast majority of Homo sapiens (some spliter Human groups may show slight more differences because of an eccentric local mutation increase -- but the African genes are not that eccentric).   But more to the point, because of where the split is (African versus not) this has a very simple explanation: The Neanderthals interbred with people who migrated out of Africa.  Its just that Neanderthal females and possibly their hybrid female offspring did not ultimately survive long term.  Now the reason for the extreme 2.5% : 97.5% ratio is probably that pure bred Homo sapiens had a higher reproduction rate.  Not because they were more fertile, but just because Neanderthals or half-breed may have been less successful in attracting mates, or perhaps their populations were simply lower.   And there it is kids.  Unless you are of pure African descent (meaning your ancestors were still in Africa  after  the migrations out of Africa 70,000 - 50,000 years ago) then you are part Neanderthal.  About 2.5%.
Your example here is user voted definitions. There are people very easy to find people who will loudly and proudly proclaim as bad or worse about Feminism. The contempt for "the other side" and the oversimplification of their grievances is neither new nor unique to either "side" of the conversation for equality.   Things like this are why both "sides" need to be careful to communicate their views respectfully and interpret others charitably. This could easily justify a "See!? Look what Feminists are like!" circlejerk that could then be screenshotted and used to justify a "See!? Look what MRAs are like!" circlejerk that results in more people drawing conclusions like the ones depicted here.   Whichever way you are coming at the question of equality, you're almost certainly going about it by advocating that something is wrong about the status quo - and not just wrong from an efficiency standpoint but from a moral one. That there is some form of injustice or mistreatment going on towards someone or some demographic, and that will always be met with resistance from the groups that have been employing that something; it will be seen as a reflection of them as people and that changing it is a direct accusation of their character rather than an appeal to a new perspective or empathy for it.   Each new perspective that comes in - whether it's an extension of an existing perspective such as third wave feminism emerging from second wave feminism, or a reaction to an existing perspective such as the MRA movement spawning in response to feminism - will be met with hostility or contempt or indignity or disdain from some. And until that perspective either dies out, becomes the norm, or gets assimilated into something else along the way, it will continue to be treated that way regardless of how long it is a "new" perspective; not because of the amount of time it's been around but because it's still different.   Things like this don't represent informed critiques of your perspective. They represent a caricature of it meant for others who already accept the caricature.
I've never really had anything horrendous happen, but my dad has. My parents were coming back from TX (my mom is white and my dad is black) and they got pulled over by a cop. He comes up to the car and sees an interracial couple and things got weird from there. He asked them what they were doing and what not. He keeps looking at my mom for signs of distress and keeps asking her if she is ok. My mom happily answers that she is great. Before he left he made sure to ask again if she was sure she was alright. Apparently mixed couples don't occur where they were in TX.
I used to be concerned about my battery too.  After a week or so I was pleased that I must have gotten a good one because I could go 2-3 days between charges with light to moderate usage.  It sounds like you're in the same boat, so congrats.  :)   After three weeks my phone locked up, I had to reboot it, and it started dying in less than 24 hours.  Sometimes it would go from 90% to dead sitting on my bedside table overnight, unused.  I couldn't trust the built-in alarms unless the phone was plugged in.  I disabled just about everything, which helped a little, but the battery situation was clearly much worse than before.   I got fed up with this and wiped and reinstalled, using iExplorer to copy all my game save files so I wouldn't lose my Angry Birds progress.  I'm happy to say that I'm back to 48 hours of battery time.
I have had unprotected sex including repeated anal intercourse in one particular instance, with all 10 of my sexual partners including my current S/O and i have never had a test ive just ignored it but i think im probably a 22 year old straight male whose become infertile through his own carelessness
I feel like I'm way to squishy for a barbarian.   You need more all resist, an IK belt with all resist will help there and give you the 2 piece bonus. [My Barb]( I would consider myself mid-tier as far as gear. I was doing Ubers with this build, but slap on a Skorn, and replace Hammer of the Ancients with rend and I can mow down MP 10 Fields with few problems.
While the Morrison Batman run gains a lot of depth the more bat history one knows - you shouldn't let that stop you from jumping in. The story will work just fine as long as you just roll with it. Early in the run, for example there are lots references to Knightfall - If you don't know ANYTHING about Knightfall, the functions of these characters is explained in is evident by their roles in the story. It is, of course easy to miss deeper themes and motifs this way, but the story will still flow, and because the narrative has so many layers it will still be rewarding.   Most  things are actually explained in the series at least to the extent you'll need them - and a lot of the things that aren't explained are things the characters don't know either.   Morrison Batman was the first in-universe on-going thing I ever stared to follow and is the reason I know lots of bat lore.   The thing about reading Morrison is always to not to worry too much about the outside references and to instead focus on what is going on and why in order to get a grip on the themes. Morrison is an author you must interpret in order to fully enjoy. For instance one of the central reoccurring motifs in the run is the phrase "the hole in things." It is never actually explained what is meant by this - but if you don't think about what it means you'll miss half the story.
So after tonight I just had to write up a post about this. For a couple of reasons, perhaps to encourage more people to participate in this, maybe to get some tips on how to improve it.   So the basic story of it was I was going to use a dried finger to summon two of my friends to kill the crocodile dogs at the water reserve bonfire (Where you join Alrditch Faithful) after Pontiff Sulyvahn.   I'd already beaten them on my first playthrough and after much tribulation I figured it'd just be easier to summon my two friends that i'd been co-opping with most of the game. Now we all knew how the dried finger worked; It can summon an additional phantom but higher chance to be invaded. One of my friends was having trouble with the matchmaking so we guessed you may only be able to summon one phantom in that area. (Still not sure if this is true.)   But the decision to use the Finger made the most amazing experience i've ever had in Dark Souls PvP. We were standing on the stairs before the giants waiting for signs to show up when I used the finger. Instantly 3 phantoms invade. 2 Aldritch faithful and a Dark spirit.   So as we were panicking a bit I had the idea to use a giant tree seed to make the mobs hostile. That turned out to be another great idea because all the priests were alive and both giants.   To cut the story of all the action down, it basically devolved into my three friends and I playing a survival game, dodging the fireballs, trying to get the giants to kill people, all the while surviving this onslaught. Every time a phantom died another took it's place without fail.   The fight was never ending, and eventually we killed all three at once and made a dash for the Crocodile dogs. And this is the more interesting of the two areas I think. Basically it was just a huge arena, the hit-like-trucks dogs running around attacking anything in reach, spells flying everywhere with different phantoms sliding down the ladder constantly.   Eventually I ( The host) met my demise and the event ended. I was out of giant seeds ( Is there a better way to get them more frequently?) so we couldn't continue and it was 2am at this point. So we packed it in and it had such an impact on me I wanted to make a post to not only tell my story but share the ideas with others so that they can try it for themselves!   Sorry about the huge wall, but I thought the details were important ^^. Thanks for reading!
So today was my first day on LoL. I probably played 5-6 matches (PvP) and got stomped repeatedly. I probably went a combined 3-30-10 playing WarWick and Sejuin (not sure on spelling). I had a guy helping me out and recommending builds but I still just couldn't do anything. I left early the last game because I was 0-8-3 and frustrated. I prefer ranged combat but really any help would be greatly appreciated.
I am a bit conflicted on that, as I'm doubtful this will pull more talent into the modding scene. With Valve taking, 75% of the profit, a really popular mod with hundreds of thousands of subscribers really won't be pulling in that much cash. Especially when compared to the salary somebody who actually does game design work (whether that's programming, graphic asset design, etc).   Let's look at the most popular mod on the Skyrim workshop, Pure Waters. It's got 816,000 subscribers. We'll make the assumption that that mod creator has spent a month of his time in the creation and support of that mod (which I think is a gross underestimate). If he charges $1 for his mod, he has made $204,000 in total, which comes out to about $1275 an hour.   I was trying to make an argument to support the idea that it wouldn't be worth a professionals time to make mods in this market, but I didn't really think about the numbers first. So this argument is over.
Yeah they do go past 100, I found a thread on gamefaqs I believe where a guy did some really extensive testing.  Unfortunately I didn't bookmark it so I can't link it, but the
Not long after our 6 months together we had a conversation about the topic of love and it basically came down to him saying that he just was not ready/did not love me yet.  I was okay with this because I did not straight up tell him that I loved him.   Two months later we were out at bars for a friend's 21st.  I was drinking and he was not.  I was so pleased with him being so great and sweet all night and putting up with me while I got drunk.  I slipped and said "I Love You" and he got mad at me, we left the bar and I cried all the way home.   Now we are approaching 10 months and Valentine's Day.  I'm always hoping that he will say it randomly, but at this point I feel like its never going to happen.  We've been talking a lot about what to do for Valentine's Day because I will be gone all day long.  He told me he thought of a cute idea and I was like DO IT!!! and he said he couldn't "because of the 'i love you thing.'" I hate that the fact that he doesn't love me back is now a "thing."  So now I pretty much know that I won't be hearing those three little words on Valentine's Day.   I think part of the problem is that he takes "I love you" a lot more seriously than I do.  I feel like I fall in love with things every day, all the time, so telling him I love him is just natural, especially when I'm out drinking and we're having a good time, and, I love him.   By now its just looming over my head and I deserve to be loved.  I do so much for him, and I put so much into this relationship that I at least deserve to be loved back.  I know that there is some guy out there who would gladly love me, but then it wouldn't be the guy that I love :\
After ordering and waiting, I get sent my vive! I pick it up today from fedex when the office opened at 8, I go home and set everything up, but when I go to download the setup from the link, my internet crashes, I spend from 9 am to 330 pm slogging my way through verizon tech support where I do 4 hours on hold total after being hung up on not one, not two, but 3 TIMES!!! After I finally get a rep to help me, they go "oh... I cant do anything for you, contact Frontier"  hangs up on me a 4th time   After contacting frontier they tell me "theres an outage in your area, theres nothing we can do ¯_(ツ)_/¯"  "do you know when I'll have service again?" "Sometime in the next week or so, Goodbye"  hung up on again for the 5th time   So here I am browsing reddit on my phone, waiting to use the vive... headset on my desk and controller in my hand
From what I can piece together (German isn't my first language, so sorry for butchering it up :(), and since English Wikipedia is useless, I suppose it happened after Kay One's last ersguterjunge album nearly 3 years ago in 2012 (Prince of Belvedair), where there was rumors that Kay was going to leave EGJ (ersguterjunge) and was affiliating with outside producers/musicians. Bushido then pulled most of his solo videos from his YouTube channel (of course not the popular ones like Style & das Geld, and Ich breche die Herzen) for money issues. Both of them traded insults with each other over Facebook and Twitter, and in Bushido's site forum (sometimes they still do to this day), for example  This back in 2012 , who made some guest apperances on Kay's album, left (but he officially signed back in 2013). One of the last things Bushido did after Kay left in mid 2012 was patent "Kay One" in the German Press Office, which means Kay One can't do any further releases under that name, so he threw "Prince" in the front.   From there, they traded insults with each other, from interviews to their disstracks against each other. One of them was by Shindy, (Alkoholisierte Pädophile) "Alcoholic Pedophile" and especially the highly controversial "Stress Ohne Grund" in July 2013, which not only attacked Kay One, but also Oliver Pocher (comedian, musician), politicians Serkan Tören,  Claudia Roth, Klaus Wowereit, and a few more. The video gave 4 million views or so within the first 2 days, before being pulled (due to harassment and threats). Politicians once again accused Bushido of being a bad influence on youth, and Bushido saw this as politicians siding with Kay. Also, since the diss track was released on Shindy's album NWA, it was indexed (blacklisted from being sold to minors (<18 year olds), thereby forbiding it to be sold in Germany. When Shindy re-released the album (NWA 2.0), he removed the song, as well as 3 other controversial songs. In November 22, Bushido released the 11 minute disstrack (Leben und Tod des Kenneth Glöckler), the "Life and Death of Kenneth Glöcker"), giving insight to how close he considered Kay One as a labelmate, building up his albums (Kenneth allein zu Haus and Prince of Belvedair) and together with Berlin rapper Fler, released the collabo album Berlin's Most Wanted. Also in the song, Bushido jabbed at Kay's first disstrack after he left EGJ, Nichts als die Wahrheit (After the Truth), where Kay accused Bushido with his connections with the Abou-Chaker-Clan, a Palestinian-Lebanese crime family. Bushido also dissed Kay in the song of not appreciating the help of Jaysus, Eko Fresh, and Royal Bunker chief Marcus Staiger (where he got his start), and that he sold out by joining AP Allstars (his new label), and being a judge for DSDS (Deutschland sucht den Superstar, the German version of American Idol). The video racked up views in the millions within the first few days of being released.   Before Bushido's diss, Prince Kay One released his album "Rich Kidz". It charted in #1 in Germany, and attracted a lot of young buyers, but critics weren't impressed. Bushido wrote on social media, and especially on the album's page on Amazon, to not buy the album. Berlin rapper Silla also jabbed at Prince Kay One, saying that he ripped off the idea of one of his songs back in 2011, and even former EGJ rapper Baba Saad threw in a diss track against Prince Kay One (Jim Knopf) with the beat to Bushido's song "Berlin".   2014 came and went, and Kay One released his disstrack "Tag des jüngsten Gerichts" (Judgement day) on November 28 as a response to Bushido's disstrack last year. Currently the rappers that do have beef with Prince Kay One: Bushido, Shindy, Ali (another rapper from Berlin, the big guy in the "Stress Ohne Grund" video putting fuel on the Mercedes-Benz SUV, affiliated with EGJ), Eko Fresh, Jaysus, Fard, Baba Saad,   Once again, sorry if I butchered up some things or events (German isn't my first language, I'm a American, and English Wikipedia is either old, or useless. :(), but this beef between the two is just dragging on at this point (3 years now). My opinion is that they should just drop the beef altogether, and who knows if they'll ever work together again.
Lets clear couple of things. we absolutely need the NSA and ability to perform foreign surveillance (the actual original purpose of the NSA) something every nation does and something that is vital to our security. as for internal, in house, domestic surveillance, that needs to change and that needs to be open and exposed and done in a transparent way even if it has security implications, people need their privacy.   In this day and age after the whole Snowden fiasco, I think people miss the crucial and grave point of what Snowden did and try and dismiss their sense of security and take it for granted, we all often confuse domestic ideals with foreign and our ability to stay strong in the US.   I cannot respect Snowden for how he handled his own actions; he fled to Russia and China while claiming he leaked information because of privacy concerns and human rights, while neither of those countries respect privacy or human rights in the slightest. Then, he revealed information about foreign surveillance programs, (the actual purpose of the NSA) something every nation does, and in doing so did considerable damage to both the American image abroad as well as at home and, more importantly, the American intelligence community, and by extension all aspects of American foreign policy. (Not to mention the headaches he must have caused our diplomats, with all the ammunition he's given foreign countries.) Who knows how much damage this has done? (And no, it isn't "our fault." While we may have been spying, so is everyone else, and that's just how diplomacy works; you either use the outrage generated by such a revelation to torpedo something you already opposed, are forced to do so by public outcry, or take advantage of the situation to score political points and/or get a better deal for your side.)   If I were Snowden, and I had determined this info worth leaking (I'm personally still torn on whether it was), I would have leaked the information about the domestic programs, and only the domestic programs, to various news outlets, and then, once the information had become public, turned myself in on the steps of the US Capital Building. Make a media event of it, invite a few reporters, do everything I can to bring the issue into the public discourse. I would have turned my trial into a public spectacle, and honestly? Had he done that, there's actually a pretty good chance he would have been pardoned, or at least gotten off easily; there would have been too much public attention and support, and unlike Manning no possibility of accusing him of "aiding the enemy." Plus, turning himself in and not fleeing the country would have demonstrated his loyalty to the United States, and shown that he stood firm in his convictions and was guided by his moral compass.   What did Snowden do instead? He leaked information on both foreign and domestic programs, to a foreign newspaper, and fled to China and Russia, two nations with both a deep disregard for the principles he supposedly stood for and with a vested interested in humiliating and opposing the United States. He stole flash drives and hard drives which he filled with classified information, as well as four government laptops he claimed were "decoys," and brought this classified information with him to these countries. Although he claims was never accessed by either, it would be foolish to believe that the Russian and Chinese intelligence services did not gain access to (and they certainly have access to all the information he provided which is now public knowledge) He is currently living in asylum in Russia, supported by the FSB and the Russian government, and allowing himself, willingly or not, to be used as Putin's personal propaganda piece as well as potential bargaining chip. How is that behavior befitting a patriot, someone who loves his country, if not his government?  Edward Snowden is no hero. He is no patriot, no activist for human rights, no whistleblower. The least of Snowden's crimes is theft. The greatest of his crimes is treason. He is a coward, a hypocrite, and a criminal.
Well, making use of "fantastical plot devices" would put you squarely in the "fantasy" realm... and not SF. That isn't to say there isn't some bleedover (Star Wars, Dr. Who, Star Trek all display some fantasy elements). But traditionally, you want to ally yourself as closely to the facts as possible. It's what's known as [Hard Science Fiction] (   In HSF you can't just whip up a plot device to explain something away. The movie [Moon] ( is a good example of HSF done right. It takes place in a hypothetical future with amazing technology... but it's all possible. There aren't any light sabers or teleporters that defy all laws of physics.   And in a way, that makes HSF even more difficult to write. The writer has to not only write a solid story with strong characters and plot, but also to ground it in with hypothetical, yet scientifically accurate advances.
Could be you just don't enjoy those types of parties. Try a different, more relaxed social scene maybe? I had fun with the Solo-cup parties while it lasted, but these days I have way more fun doing more relaxed things like game night meetups, quiz nights, dinner parties and the like. You still get all the booze and social interactions, but without everyone feeling like they need to be on their coolest (in that high-school kind of way) behavior. And if a partner is what you're looking for, I'd venture to say that you're more likely to find Mr./Ms. Right in that kind of environment!
Today, I received a phone call from my school saying that I may potentially fail 2 of my courses in my final year of high school. If I fail, I'm not going to graduate. I don't know what it is, but I just have NO motivation to complete the assignments that my teachers give me and the only things that are keeping my mark up are my tests.   I've heard many different speeches such as, "This is for your benefit, not ours" from my parents and on my report cards the comments are always "If Paul put full effort into his work, his grades will better represent his capabilities."   I don't know what it is, but I just can't get over this threshold to do my assigned work. I'll have a pep talk from a teacher, counselor, friend or parent... go hard on my studies for one week and then go back to my old ways.   I really want to graduate with my friends, I know I have to work hard, I know I have the brain to get me good grades... I just don't have the confidence or motivation to ask for help or to do my work on time. Please reddit, help me out. Can anyone relate to my situation? Does anyone have a motivational pep talk they can give me that will be embedded in my mind that isn't cliche? Thanks reddit.
Gee, ya think? What did you think the point of my
I often play Smash Bros Brawl and PM with a friend of mine who is much better than me. I lose almost every match, and it can get frustrating, but that's not really what bothers me. This guy counter-picks characters and stages. In addition, he also gets really pissed in the rare event that he does lose. When I'm ahead, he gets really intense and acts pissed if I celebrate at all.   I know its good to play against people that are better than you, but this seems a little much to me. It's impossible to get any feedback out of him too since he just wants to win all the time. He doesn't want me to improve because he'd rather win. Any feedback I do get comes in variations of: "Ha! Shouldn't have done that!" or some such.   I've been to tournies and played people better than me, and that's usually a blast, with both players exchanging advice and high fives after. I can't imagine that happening here.   I'd like to play people who are better than me and learn from it, but this guy just frustrates me whenever he comes over.   Anyway, \rant.
I'm all for Goldman Sachs bashing but none of their actions suggest any grand conspiracy.   It's not like they sold all the stock the day before the spill, but rather the entire quarter leading up to it.  They also only sold less than 50% of their BP holdings so their other half still took a huge hit.   This article just draws in dumb liberals like Fox News draws in dumb conservatives, by throwing out key words like GOLDMAN SACHS and OIL SPILL.
I have a fantastic wolf-spider story for you:   I live in MN as well, and we had a sort of "pet" one that lived on our front porch and had an enormous, BEAUTIFUL web.  We didn't want to kill her because she got rid of the box elder bugs and such.   As per every Sunday, my mom went out front to shake out the rugs in the house.  She continued her daily cleanings until around 7pm when she went to the bathroom to brush her teeth.  She put water on her toothbrush, then the paste, then looked up to begin the process.   Low and behold, there was our enormous wolf-spider just chilling on her shoulder.  I was in the computer room and my dad was downstairs at the moment when my mom started screaming.  She comes flailing into the computer room screaming "GET IT OFF ME!  GET IT OFF ME!!"  I see it, start screaming, and run the opposite direction, screaming for my dad.  And she fucking chases ME downstairs where I was running to get my dad.   I watched from a very safe distance as my dad had to use a hand towel to get it off my mom as she stood there flailing her hands and doing a crying-whine.  Then our lady spider got flushed down the toilet.   The end.
My intention wasn't to outrage, honestly. I hold them both in the highest esteem. For clarity's sake, I'm white and I was 8 days old when Dr. King was assassinated.  Their lives and their struggles are all history to me.  I know Dr. King got bloody. I know he marched. I know he paid a heavy price for it.  But whether he was behind a pulpit or the bars of a jail cell he was always a symbol and an inspiration for what we could and should be as a nation. That's what I meant by walking with angels.  Brother Malcolm, and here I can only relay what others have said about him, looked for a more immediate solution. He worried less about integration (at the start) and more about personal dignity and the black community lifting itself up. Respect for self. Respect for others. But in the face of conflict, it will be met. His offer in the telegram to Dr. King to go to St. Augustine and face the Klan is a great example. A simple solution to an immediate problem.  This is what I meant by walking with the people. I don't think these men could ever be separated. They, along with Medger Evers, WEB DuBois, Rosa Parks (and the thousands of others I am shamefully omitting because my brain is going numb), are all important parts of the same cause. Martin and Malcolm accomplished great things, and by 1965 they were beginning to cooperate and work together. One wonders how far along we'd be if they'd had the chance.
I had the exact same experience (right down to the engineering students and best friends), except I am the little brother. My older brother punched me on some trip at DisneyLand (world? idk, the one in Florida). Anyways, he was being a dick to the parentals and i had said something akin to "dude, stop being such a dick." Next thing i know I'm on my hands and knees gasping for air.
This is insanity, in a nutshell:     first 9 minutes are called "warm up."  You do a round of actions that take about 3 minutes, 3 times.  Each round you are supposed to do them faster...imagine doing double heisman without the pose at the end, AS FAST AS YOU CAN side to side.  The faster you do a lot of moves, the more you're jerking/snapping limbs, the less you're using muscle - those with back injuries etc will have to go a little slower.     Next 10 minutes or so... you finally stretch.  The stretches, if you've done  p90X, are really disappointing.  They are 10 minutes too late in some ways, and they don't actually stretch the things you'll be using.  I found them lacking.     It's been a little while, but I believe most go through another phase similar to the first 10 minutes before stretching, and then in the final stretch, it throws in a lot of burpee type moves.  It switches to the moves involving dropping to the floor to the Plank position, legs "running," jump back up.     My main criticism, nursing a lower back nerve problem, revolve around not having a 20 year old spider monkey of a body - the girl he says "if you look like her, you're doing it right" is doing a severely injury causing spazzing and shouldn't be on film unless in the "before" of an infomercial injury prone person.  The higher intensity means doing the moves faster and faster, fully sacrificing form.  When you scan the room, these people are seriously whipping elbows, snapping knees, and using their back when they shouldn't be.     repeating every 30 seconds "engage your abs" doesn't necessarily mean someone doing the video will know how that translates.  I did insanity while doing PT for a back issue, so... I knew all about engaging my abs and using my abs to do leg kicks.     If you're used to p90x, you will notice that muscle groups never get the same rest - every day, same ones are hit.  The mix up of dvds also does not feel "calculated," in as much as p90x (to me) feels very balanced... chest/back and shoulders/arms one phase, back/bicep and shoulders/triceps/chest the next phase.  Insanity is just a mish mosh, every day, back to back or randomly spaced.       All that said, it DOES get your heart rate up, you certainly feel the burn, work up a sweat.  When I did it, I maybe took some of the "impact" out and made sure I was fully engaging my abs, but if I hadn't just had a major session in how to do body movement protecting my lower back, I might have don't a lot worse.  Example: One move is like a cowboy horse stance, you kick one leg, leaping with the remaining leg and then switching kicking out with the other leg.  So you're continually leaping leg to leg, while kicking - now- do this slow, feeling your abs be totally rock hard, helping lift each leg as you kick..(without the hopping)... it's okay on the back.  doing it their way... it turns into a lot of unstable whipping and ugly form.  If you're young, have at it.  I'm only late 30's, but I found myself having to do a slower careful version because theirs was... just.. dumb.   -
Maybe he got the original list from someone else. Without knowing the original source, he didn't think much about crediting it when changing the format.
The telecom companies like to pretend the "last mile" is prohibitively expensive, but it's a lie. There's a significant initial investment, but once the lines are installed (particularly if it's fiber) they won't need to be replaced for  decades . The companies can easily cover these costs with installation charges (which they already do) and multi-year contracts (which they already do). But why do that when they can just spend some money lobbying Congress and installing employees in the FCC and other agencies to foot the bill? And as a nice bonus, they get a nice legal monopoly.
I began playing POE sometime last week and i think im beginning to get the hang of the very basics. I found a build (with guide) which so far is very fun and easy to play. Must things questions have easily been answered through the wiki or Google etc but i haven't been able to find any specifics on max rolls for stats on gear anywhere (I might just be derpy I'd like to think not) Can you maybe point me in the direction of a spreadsheet or a previous post I might have missed? Any help would be greatly appreciated
I got up, told the girl to call me in the morning when she was sober and I would take her out for breakfast and we could get to know each other.  I was 18 and a Freshman in college, home for winter break.  Girl I had been interested (a.k.a obsessed) calls me up and tells me to come to a party she's at.  Get there, she's in a bed in one of the rooms.  We talk, she tries to get busy.  I really like her and tell her that if she actually likes me I would love to go on a couple dates or whatever.  She never called :/.
I completely agree, sometimes the simplest of notions can effect people the most.   When i was younger i worked at a shoe store, a small but busy place along the main street. It was open faced and we had a table of shoes up front which you had to pass left or right to get in. Naturally it wasn't the best of jobs and so I spent most of the time pretending to sort this table or re-lace shoes to pass the time.   One day I'm up front trying to look inconspicuous when an older Indian couple approached the store. I noticed them immediately due to a young, arrogant, trust-fund toting, jock asshole loudly berating them from behind. He was with two friends who, though not joining in, were laughing along with him. He was making remarks about the Indian man's turban and making obscene racist remarks about his wife and the clothes they were wearing. I was disgusted, i had never in my days seen such blatant public disregard for another human being.   The Indian couple shyly entered my store as if to let the young guys past and end the humiliation. This seemed to wind up the racist kid, he slowly started to make his way around the table as his friends took a look at some shoes, still making loud jokes about "brown" people. Now im a tall skinny guy and this boy, though roughly the same age, had at least twenty pounds of muscle in difference. My eyes had been locked on him since i first saw him. My gaze must have been a mixture of disgust and pure hatred. As as he made his way towards entering the store i found myself flowing his movement directly into his path. Remember this is a small store so i was effectively blocking his way to the two Indians who i assumed were behind me. He stopped, obviously noticing my eyes locked like daggers in his face. I can remember it perfectly, at first he looked angry, like he wanted to take me on, I kept my ground. His face suddenly changed to confusion, I didnt budge. Suddenly he takes a step back and shakes his head as if to say "its just a joke", I just stood there, straight faced, my brain completely shut down from the disgust flowing through my veins. He turns to his friends and tells them to hurry up before jovially walking away as if nothing had happened.   It took me a little while to comprehend what had just went down. Blocking his path, looking at him in disgust, not budging, were all just natural reactions, but the simplicity and effectiveness of simple non-verbal or physical embarrassment still surprises me to this day. The boy was obviously just a sad and misguided kid looking for some attention. The Indian couple quickly left, it was obvious to me then they didn't come in to buy shoes. They said nothing to me, nor did i say anything to them, they had had a rough enough day.   Sorry, this should have been a lot shorter but i wanted to say my two cents. I think Sethandtheswan did the best thing possible and i can almost assure you that the girl took it more personally than any other action could have done.
I have been dating my boyfriend since August, and it has been a wonderful 8 months. We have been classmates since freshman year and were on good terms, but had never really had enough interaction to be considered friends or anything. Around June of last year, however, a mutual friend brought us closer together. We started hanging out for a month or so as friends, but by the time August came around, we knew we wanted to be more than that.   We began dating knowing that college was around the corner, and that long distance was a very likely concept. Now that decisions are out for our schools, we have a better idea of where we're going.   He is likely going to school in Maryland, North Carolina, or our home state of South Carolina. I will either be going to school here in SC, North Carolina, or... Arizona. So, long distance will be a factor no matter what. The closest distance is an hour and a half (though luckily it's the most probable option, but I'm waiting on my top choice to give me a definite financial aid response).   He's totally cool with long distance, but I'm scared out of my mind. I love him, I really do-- he was my first "real" boyfriend and honestly, these past few weeks I've been getting some pretty deep feelings for him, deeper than I thought I would have. I know he feels the same.   We're best friends, very compatible in many ways, have a lot of common interests, do not fight often (and do not fight dirty when we do). Save for a few small issues that we're working on, we have a very healthy relationship with a ton of communication that has helped us solve a lot of issues that could have otherwise hurt our relationship.   I could easily see us lasting long distance, but I'm still scared. College is a big place with a lot of people, and I'm honestly kind of afraid of him being tempted by other girls. I know I need to trust him more, but I do know him quite well, and being a ladies man is in his nature. I am much less social, dynamic, and outgoing than he is, and do not like putting myself out there. I am not so much worried about finding other guys.   On the other hand, I do know he can commit. He went long distance for two years with a girl he broke up with before we got together. Though I always worry he would dump me for another girl the same way he dumped her for me, I also know they had a lot of issues stemming from her controlling personality. I also take solace in the fact that, though the opportunity presented itself, he never ever laid a hand on me in a non-platonic way until he had broken up with her. He feels very strongly about cheating.   Still, I am afraid he will change his mind, just because I know 18 is quite young. I feel that I will NOT change my mind-- there is no one quite like him, and I would be surprised if I met someone who was more appealing to me. I am aware the possibility is out there, however.   Also, we are each other's first sexual partners. I am afraid he will get an urge to "test the waters". I honestly have no problem if he has JUST sex with other girls (as long as we have a lot of communication and trust), but I do know that he is the type to associate feelings with sex. I broached the idea of an open relationship and he quickly shot it down, so I will respect that. I am not dying to have sex with other guys, no interest at all right now.   Given all this, could we make it? Most of these hangups are just my fears talking. I want to believe we can make it work, but damn if I don't always see "just break up with your HS boyfriend, you don't know what you want at 18", "you'll find someone you'll like better", "he'll cheat on you", etc etc. It seems like there are no success stories out there, and I'm really starting to doubt the strength of something I really thought was unbreakable.
Avoiding spoilers don't worry. I don't understand why it's so popular having completed it. I just finished it yesterday and I honestly thought the actual gameplay was pretty meh. The sounds, graphics and story were very good but the whole time I just felt the game wasn't designed to be a game. I only actually upgraded two weapons and used them 90% of the time. I only fully upgraded two plasmids or whatever they were called. Fire, Bronco and Possession is all I used the entire game. The gunplay felt really poor and the bad AI didn't help. Big hype about skylines that only showed up in a few places and were only there so you could run away from handymen easily. No penalty for death at all. You lose some money? Big deal, I'm not even using it for anything. It almost rewards you for dying by having the enemies ignore you and healing you up.
One of the places I lived in college was right across the street from campus. 2-3 times a week the landscaper dudes would use a leaf blower at ~12:30 in the morning. The head of my bed was right next to the (1mm thin) window, which was right next to the street that separated me from the blasphemous leaf blowers. I ended up calling the campus police one night and received a voice mail from the head of campus police the next morning, saying they gave the campus' landscaping crew a cease and desist order—then proceeded to say "they were only supposed to be using them at idle". Bullshit, they just assumed/hoped no one complained. I like to think I was the anonymous hero of the apartment  complex after that.
You know what? I hear this a lot, but I'd like to differ. The 'fear of rejection' feeling is (in my opinion only, no way am I claiming to state fact) a much better feeling than the feeling of actual rejection. Before you've said anything to the girl, you have that tiny little optimistic voice in the back of your head, that thinks about the positive outcome. Also, you can interact with the girl normally, without having to worry about coming off as weird (not the right word, but I have no word that directly gets across what I mean).   Meanwhile, once you've been rejected, the optimistic voice in your head is dead, and every time you interact with the girl, some part of you is bound to think you're coming across as "that guy who doesn't know when to back off", even if she's not really thinking that. Plus, the fact that she rejected you causes all those imaginary castles you built up to come crashing down in one fell swoop (This last one isn't a bad thing, but it sure as hell is painful)   IMO, I was much happier when I was afraid of saying anything, than I was post-rejection.
When I was about 11 or 12 my aunt moved into a new house. There was a massive snow storm so she was babysitting my cousin and I because school was cancelled. We play football outside in the street because, why not? Getting tackled into snow banks is awesome.   The one rule my aunt gives is: "If you have to go to the bathroom, use the bathroom in the basement. I don't want you tracking snow all over my new floors."   So we're playing football, and at this point some kids in the neighborhood have joined us. I run a deep route and catch a perfect ball tossed to me. One of the kids spears me head on right into my stomach. Hit the snow bank, feel my stomach gurgling, and tell everybody I'll be right back.   I run into the basement, but I cannot find the light switch. I never had been down there before, and there was barely any light getting in. Time was running out, and I had to do something before I shit my pants.   I look around in a panic and can't find the bathroom. I start to freak and notice her cats' litter box on the floor. I decide I have no choice, pull my pants down, and proceed to have the most watery shit in my entire life up to that point. The best way to describe it was "butt pee." It was exactly as if my butt was peeing out a stream of shit.   So as I'm taking a shit, I look to my right and FINALLY spot the bathroom. Finish shitting, waddle over and wipe up/flush, and get ready to go back outside. As I pass the litter box I realize I have to do something about it. I grab the giant jug of Tidy Cat and dump it into the box, shrug go back outside.   A couple of days later I overhear my mom talking to my aunt on the phone. Apparently she was super freaked out that her cats were sick because of the enormous clump she found in the litter box. Never told them it was me.
Well by calling it "ignorance" your setting up the argument in a way that leads to the conclusion that it's immoral. You assume that censorship is intended to keep people from knowledge, when usually it's intended to keep people from certain types of "bad" information. In the case of authoritarian governments and religions, the information is deemed bad because it threatens the stability of the institution. In the case of more commonly accepted forms of censorship, like libel laws or anti-propaganda measures, the information is bad because it's false and harmful to those who take it as fact.   So the
As a monogamous woman, I will say that I prefer condom-free sex so long as there's another reliable contraceptive being used (for me that's the pill.)   But condoms have so many of their own benefits. Four Seasons banana flavoured ones are fucking delicious. Plus there's the decreased risk of sexual infection spread. It's mentally reassuring to have a physical barrier between your vagina and your partner's semen (how many posts does r/sex see from people freaking out about cumming inside/being cummed into, even though they use another contraceptive?)  Less mess is awesome. They're cheap and super easy to use. They aren't invasive like an IUD or Implanon, and you can't "forget" like you can with the pill. They've come a long way and are available in a lot of sizes, thicknesses and there are even low-odour condoms available now.  They're a great invention and I'm super glad they exist!   I think the stereotype that sex with a condom on = dulled sensations, decreased intimacy and stinky latex is very damaging to people who have sex, or will one day have sex. That myth is so entrenched in popular culture that it's not even questioned any more. I can't say for certain, but maybe it started in WW1 when they were thick, reusable rubber encouraged for use by soldiers to prevent them catching the clap from wanton overseas women. I've seen pictures of those old-fashioned condoms and they WOULD ruin sex. But people in the modern day ran with the myth despite the advances in material/quality/thickness/durability (often making dumb comments and putting themselves in risky situations because of it.) Of course sex with a condom feels different to sex without one. But that doesn't make it the awful, arduous boner-killer that some people would have you believe. I think that if sex partners put effort into learning each other's unique preferences, sex will always be fantastic, rubber or not.   I don't even think porn is to blame. Sure, a lot of porn (video, written, whatever) doesn't go into safer sex practices at the beginning (we would skip that bit anyway), but we are able to separate the reality of pornography with it's safety waivers and mandatory STI screening with the reality of average people having average sex.   As an aside, I remember one lesson of sex ed where female and male students were separated for more in-depth education without the fear that they would be made fun of by the other gender. Our teacher actually suggested that if our future partners tried to avoid using condoms, we could say that we 'felt so good you'd think you weren't wearing one.' It was probably totally inappropriate for a high school sex ed class, but THAT is how pervasive the anti-condom myth is.
I think It's pointless to talk about the United States' wealth before the civil war. Going back far enough, all countries stole their land from someone. Also, the U.S. didn't have much wealth to speak of. The U.S. was nearly insolvent and had all the same issues of every other country until just after this period (drought, pestilence, poverty). I've even read position papers arguing that slavery is economically less sustainable than a fair market wage. So examine what happened after that period.   I would argue that the mechanization and modern farming practices developed in the late 19th century employed on the vastly fertile American farms was the foundation for everything else.   Partnered with stability in the form of no war on U.S. soil and laissez faire governmental practices (which admittedly lead to exploiting laborers), you have a recipe for the creation of wealth.
Read the first 40 pages of Life of Pi. I can almost guarantee you that your mind will be changed. In a nutshell it basically says that animals for the most part live their entire lives not knowing where their next meal will be. They are constantly having to survive in harsh territory and many have to worry about predators. In a zoo, they aren't able to "roam free" but they also don't have to and probably don't want to. If a wild animal was given a choice on having to roam around the country looking for food or a nice comfortable area where everything is provided for them I'd assume that they would choose the latter. Imagine yourself being offered the choice to be thrown into the amazon left to fend for yourself, or being put up in a nice hotel where people wait on you hand and foot. To the point where they bring in women for you to have sex with, food everyday, adjust the temperature to your likeness, constantly check your health and overall happiness. It becomes their domain. Most animals that are "let free" from zoos choose not to leave and the ones that do run away almost always return to their artificial habitat because they like it there.
Ok here's the thing. I believe that I'm a decent constructed player despite the fact that I've only been playing for 3weeks now but don't let that fool you, I've been actively following the scene for about a year and a half (Precisely when the very first webisode of ESGN's Fight Nights series began.) Playing constructed isn't an issue for me.   Here's my problem. I can't for the life of me get more than 3 wins in arena (4 being my best). I've read countless guides / videos and they seem to gravitate around the same guidelines which I think I understand the overall message being sent to viewers.   Despite all that I can't seem to progress or improve in arena. I think my problem is that even though I try to pick arena favoured cards, my subconscious seems to make me build a constructed type deck. (I think lol). The reasoning behind this is that when ever I watch someone doing an arena run, I try and analyze their deck and draft picks and most of the time they don't seem to make sense. Yet they're able to get +5 wins usually pretty easily.   I think that all I need is for someone to coach me through 1 successful run to properly understand the arena mindset. So I challenge anyone willing to take a shot at this. We can Skype during the run and if the end result is 5 or more wins I'll gladly send you 20$ via PayPal.
You know how reddit people act like karma doesn't matter, but they try to amass as much as possible anyway?   Well.. on 4chan, getting numbers in a row like this is kinda similar (because it's so rare). The poster said Quints, but got 6's instead...  Which is so relevant because he mentioned "satan".
Being a huge  Star Wars  fan, I thought I would look into it a bit.   A lightsaber is a beam of pure plasma that emits no heat until it comes in contact with something else. When this electromagnetic field comes into contact with another material, instead of the solid passing through the field and shorting out the arc, typically it would merely provide physical resistance (giving the blade a feeling of solidity whilst cutting through blast doors, droids, Sith, Jedi, younglings, and various other meatbags). The denser the material, the more resistance there would be. Lightsabers also reflect other energy fields and 'coherent energy' such as blaster bolts and other lightsabers.   In the  Star Wars  universe, there are a few materials that are capable of repelling a lightsaber. The most well-known is a metal known as cortosis which, when purified, could actually short out a lightsaber, rendering it temporarily unusable. Being that cortosis ore kills you instantly on contact it was usually used as a cortosis alloy instead, which could repel a lightsaber blade but not short it out.   Other lightsaber-resistant materials include phrik, a metallic compound used in the electrostaffs used by General Grievous's MagnaGuards and in Darth Sidious's lightsaber hilt; Mandalorian iron, a metal found on Mandalore incorporated into Mandalorian armor and weaponry; amorweave, a cloth used in various armors that provided a small amount of resistance to lightsaber blades; and Sith alchemy, used by the Sith to reinforce metals (particularly against lightsabers), used most notably in Darth Vader's armor. Similar to Sith alchemy, it seems that many Force-imbued materials and objects were generally resistant to lightsabers as well.   (Side note: If you want a great example of blocking a ligthsaber blade, check out the  third cinematic trailer for  Star Wars: The Old Republic   And then we have mithril. To my understanding, part of the allure of mithril is how much resistance it gives while still remaining lightweight, allowing for easier movement without sacrificing protection (useful for a Hobbit). Mithril is also very shiny (as the best things in life generally are) and lasts for a very long time without corroding, allowing mithril to be used in heirlooms and the like. Examples include Frodo's mithril coat, Galadriel's ring (one of the three Elven Rings), and the helmets worn by the Guards of the Citadel of Minas Tirith.   My conclusion: It's entirely possible. Lightsabers are pretty cool and all, but Frodo sure takes a beating wearing that mithril coat of his. It might, however, have had a lot to do with  how  it was made, what with the craftsmanship of the chain mail and such. Lightsabers don't usually care too much about that as much as the material itself.   I would imagine, however, that there are probably other forms of lightsaber-resistance in  Lord of the Rings : particularly, magic. I assume that magic in  LotR  is a form of energy, the same as a lightsaber's blade. Meaning any materials or magical defenses against any form of magicks would also repel the energy of a lightsaber blade as well. For instance, I'm sure that if Gandalf was fighting the Balrog with a lightsaber (which would be  awesome ), I don't think the Balrog's whip would be instantly severed if Gandalf blocked with his lightsaber.   And so there you have it, my two cents. Sorry if it turned into a wall of text, it was kind of a stream of consciousness. Hope this helped at least a little bit! :]
I was in a Business Studies lesson in school (A levels) and my teacher told us the Labour party conference was happening that day, and it would be the top story in the news that night, unless something catastrophic happened. It was an afternoon lesson so it's entirely possible the attack was happening right at that moment (this is in the UK).   An hour later school finished and I got picked up by Mum. On the radio they were talking about a terrorist attack in New York. As soon as I got home I turned on the TV and watched rolling news for over an hour in shock and awe.
I have a friend who is a call girl on backpage and she got me into it a few months ago. Please no unnecessary remarks by the way, I didn't come here to get judged. We're poor college students and it helps so much you wouldn't believe. Anyway, one of my closest friends, who is a guy, recently asked me to be his girlfriend. He's aware of what I do, and I turned him down because I figured I would have to stop if I was in a relationship. But to my surprise, he  told me that he doesn't actually mind if I keep doing it, as long as I don't cheat "romantically" with another guy.   I was just wondering, could this work? Like, could he ever respect me and love me like in a normal relationship, or would he always see me as just some "whore"? Also I'm a little scared that if we ever broke up he could like go tell my parents what I'm doing. If they found out they would literally disown me, they're both Eastern European immigrants and very traditional. I mean, I really really don't think he would actually do that, he's a great person, but I guess it's an irrational fear that I have. So what do you think, should I go for it? I like him ,but I'm really hesitant.
I am doing this all from memory, so it is sketchy, but here it goes.   Neighbors had reported the man because he was doing construction on his property for a septic tank.  Apparently he was not doing the job well and neighbors were worried his septic waste would enter their property or contaminate their well/water.  Also, of course he did not have a permit to do the work and did not inform anyone he was doing it.  I think that was the problem, so people were called.   The inspector had right to see it apparently because it was in plain sight on the side of his yard.  It was not hidden at all.  So the courts ruled that they had to right to inspect it.  Now that may not be popular around here, but the policeman and the woman were actually following the law.  They did not get in trouble.  They were allowed to inspect the construction because it was in plain view.   If I remember correctly the man was fined or had to stop construction.  The policeman and woman caught a lot of flak from the internet, but they were just doing their jobs.  I know people here want to respect property rights, but no law was broken here by the authorities (apparently).  Now if laws were changed, then maybe they would not be allowed to do so.
I guess aesthetics will always be in the eye of the beholder; I was certainly crazy about the alienware look a couple years ago but I've gotten to the point where I really can't stand the sight of it anymore. If you don't keep that thing in pristine condition (from the glossy screen to the keys to the fingerprint magnet on the back) it will get ugly fast, and although I was motivated enough to take care of it like it were my child for a few months, I eventually got too busy with school and work to deal with it. Hopefully you can hold out longer than I can, but whatever you do please heed my advice and clean those fans out as frequently as you possibly can. If you ever feel it begin to perform sluggish, don't go to mycleanpc.com (joke), just take the back off and blow compressed air all over it.   The subtle look is actually what I'm looking forward to most about having a Sager; I thought I would enjoy being that guy at the library that everyone stared at when he pulled out his laptop but it turns out that got old for me pretty quick. Not to mention I'd have to hide that thing from all my compsci GSI's because they'd just laugh when I pulled it out. I don't really know why alienwares have that reputation and honestly when that computer worked, it worked very, very well but its performance was so incredibly inconsistent that it began to drive me nuts. One day I would be playing BF3 on high settings at 50-60 FPS (on a two year old computer that was remarkable) and the next I wouldnt be able to break 30 on medium; usually blowing on the fans a bit helped but there were those inexplicable days when nothing I tried doing helped, it simply refused to perform well.   If you want something compact I would not count MSI's out;  one I was looking at as a contender  but it was only 1.46 inches thick and 5.6 lbs, which I'm pretty sure can hold its own with any ultrabook out there. Also I notice you say you don't want a behemoth and to that I say I hope you've held an Alienware in your hands because those things are deceptively massive (especially in height), even the m14x is 6.45 pounds, which is almost a pound heavier than the MSI I linked and is actually only a quarter of a pound lighter than the 15 inch Sager I'm purchasing for myself. Not to mention, the MSI has much better specs for the price than the m14x; one thing I hate about companies that review Alienwares is they load them full of the most expensive performance upgrades and the computer they review is actually a thousand dollars more expensive than its MSRP.
Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks. Lived together for three years. Went through a hell of a lot with each other, never had an argument up until now.   He broke up with a longtime girlfriend a few months ago, and has been struggling since. Always whining, seeming lost. Hadnt slept with anyone since, really struggling with girls. We graduated from college a few weeks ago, he accepted a masters in another country.   We planned a going away party for him. I had also hooked him up with two months work with a family member at an awesome company near where he'd be doing his masters.   At the party he gets super drunk and tries to sleep with everyone. Invites people up to rooms, all without success. My ex was there (we dated for two years), who had spent months playing mind games with me.   I turned her down. Again. I'm there with my new girlfriend. Next thing I know, the best and the ex are having sex in my bed.   With this guy, Iv basically spent the last year or so picking him up from a really hard break up, only to see it blow up in my face. I felt pretty humiliated. He went to work with my aunt, meanwhile the ex has continually tried to message me.   He came back to collect his degree, as we were graduating college. Whilst out celebrating, he again got super wasted and slept with our friends ex.   The three of us had lived together for a year, all dating these aforementioned women. My friend has now slept with all three women from this period.   He would identify the three of us as adopted brothers, due to all the things we've seen and lived through in our individual lives.   All of these encounters are one night stands, and always with a lot of alcohol. Neither woman knows about the other. Our friend doesnt know he slept with his ex also. Myself and my bf are the only ones who know the whole story.   He repeatedly comes home to stay at my house, often acting like things are normal. Iv repeatedly told him how uncool everyone things he's acting, but he brushes it off. With the most recent incident, he's acting like he cant remember.   We always have seen each other as confidantes, and he often tells me how he's feeling about being in a new country/college and being away from everyone etc. Honestly, I'm just sick of listening to him and his bullshit. Whining to me, after hurting our friendship.   I feel like I'm trying to be the bigger man in this relationship, but my question is my disgust in him justified? What should I do with him? Iv been forgiving, but I feel like he's just causing too many issues for everyone else to deal with.
I have an Acer Aspire One D270, which was running Windows 7 Starter. I tried installing Xubuntu (13.10, I think) on it. Things were going well for a while, but I realised that Xubuntu wasn't what I needed this laptop for.   And then a problem happened after an update with Windows, wherein Windows Explorer wouldn't show up outside of Safe Mode, and neither would the desktop.   I tried using Acer Recovery, Windows Restore point, and neither of these worked (they both required a reset, and then Xubuntu would take over).   So I went into safe mode and deleted the partition that had Xubuntu on it, and reset the computer.   And now grub is saying "Error: partition not found" and entering rescue mode.   As a side note, I learned basically nothing about Ubuntu while I had it installed, so I'm totally lost, and have no idea what to do next. I thought I could use DBAN to completely blow away the drive and start again, but I'm not sure.
Hello, all. This is gonna be a bit long.   So, BF (24) and I (22) have been together for over 3 years, living together for ~2.5 years. Our sex life used to be great, both HL.   In the last year or so, things have started to slow down, which I expected. New jobs, more hours and responsibilities and all that. We were still having relatively regular sex, a few times a week.   Now in the last 5 mos or so, it has really dropped off. Maybe  once every week, but more often every two. He used to be aggressive and dominant and passionate.   Now...I'm lucky to get a 35 second ride, after I did all the work to even get him interested.   I get no foreplay, though he still expects oral. He used to be very generous about returning the favor, but I get nichts.   Around the beginning of the major drop off, I started to feel paranoid. One night he rebuffed me, and went back downstairs for a while, only to come up half an hour later to wake me for sex. I felt bad afterwards. I wondered if he went down to watch porn just so he could fuck me.   So, I went and looked at the computer and there was quite a bit of it in the history. The kicker being that when we'd first started dating we'd agreed to no porn, as I was uncomfortable with it. He told me I was plenty to keep him occupied (and I was sure to be ) and that he could always have naughty pics/vids of me /us if I wasn't around to take care of him.   I was more angry about the 3 years of lying about it than anything. I confronted him, he cried, apologized, and all that.   Told me he wouldn't continue with it, and we had a long discussion about our sexual needs and I offered to reevaluate the porn thing if it were truly an issue. He said that he knew it made me uncomfortable and he didn't want to continue with it.   Time goes on, he becomes more and more distant in the bedroom. He's started staying out with his friends after work until after I leave for my shift, when the time between was usually used for  sex/shower/fun and a meal together.   I've been snooping, he watches porn a lot when I'm not home/asleep/just fucking left.   He acts like nothing is different between us. We still get along and I love him, but I am not handling the lack of intimacy well.   I don't really know that to do. He's very sensitive about stuff like this, and I worry about hurting his feelings.
Wasn't an employee, was a customer.  Was looking for one of those Emerson TV deals they had last year. The woman about 6 people in front of my wife and I pepper sprayed a guy over a Xbox 360.  What she didn't realize was is they had more.
Unfortunately, they kind of have to. Marriage affects all kinds of things like taxes, inheritance, liability, custody and guardianship... Governments are kind of forced to draw a line somewhere or else they can't effectively enforce a lot of other laws, most of which are beneficial to society as a whole. They need to be able to clearly define who is married, and who is not in order to make that happen.   That said, I feel governments should strive for a marriage definition that does not discriminate against one group or another. I feel that legalizing homosexual marriage makes our system more fair.

Worked at a fast food restaurant... you know the kind of place: manager was backstabby and constantly threatened firing people. She also wouldn't let people have time for the bathroom, telling them instead to "pee in the mop sink" (a little niche in the back just for the mop bucket and spraying out pieces of equipment). She had a policy in place where "if you were a good employee, you got your check a day early." She also had a bad habit of not making the schedule out for the day until that morning meaning you were always on call and could never have a life. I tried explaining to her a couple times you couldn't do this, especially at a minimum wage job but she never listened. Me and my girlfriend of the time both worked there and we were tired of it. We came to the mutual agreement that if they couldn't make the schedule out reasonably, that meant we had the day off. Lo and behold, we couldn't get our paychecks early the next week because "we weren't good employees."   Turns out corporate inspection was coming up and all previous year of her not allowing us the time to properly clean  anything  caught up. Two days before inspection, we got tired of the shit and quit. The entire shift left with us as well as about 40% of the remaining employees. I was told later that everyone was pretty much waiting for someone to walk out and I was that person.   Manager had to call in her girlfriend (did I mention that she was one of those militant men hating lesbians, vocally insulting male customers and employees?) and they worked nonstop without sleep for two days to clean the place up.   The store failed corporate inspection and the manager ran out of the store crying her head off and disappeared for two days. No one knew where she was. When she came back, she had been fired by corporate, essentially blacklisted from the company. By the time she came back, word had already gotten out around town what kind of failure and asshole she was and no one would hire her regardless of the job or position. She had to break her lease and leave town and hasn't been back since. Last I heard, she was depressed for sixth months because of this incident, tried to kill herself, her girlfriend left because of it, and she had to move to a town about 2 hours away.   Corporate carted employees in from two states away to take over the store and keep it from closing. For six months, they ran on reduced hours and hired no one local.   Best "I quit" in my entire life.
I'm sorry you're dealing with this.  I was diagnosed with Endometriosis over a decade ago (wow it feels weird to say that) and it is not fun.  With that said, it's usually something that is manageable.  Many ladies here gave some great advice on questions to ask (did they explore the entire pelvic area, methods of removal, etc) but I would also ask if the endo has caused any damage so far to your organs.   I've never been sure how much birth control helps.  I never feel much of a difference being on it vs being off it, but I continue to take it.   Many doctors will recommend Lupron.  Someone already posted that they experienced good things with this.  I would say for most people Lupron has been a hell drug.  It's dangerous (do some research).  I've been meeting up with women with endo since I was diagnosed and almost nobody had anything good to say about it.  Most women have experienced some kind of damage to their bodies and extreme mental health issues.  Most who had it help the endo pain said the endo came back shortly after stopping injections.  One of the women in my group tried to kill herself while on the drug and found it was because of the depression that set in after starting it.   I'm not trying to make decisions for you, but I find doctors push this drug too much and too easily.  Just make sure you weigh your options and if you can, talk to women with endo who have tried it.   What I do to treat my endo is pretty simple.  I started by changing my diet.  I've cut out as many processed foods as I can and severely cut down on sugars.  I've cut out red meat (I still eat chicken and fish, which often is considered a no-no, but I love it too much). I have some great recipes I could send to you if you're looking at changing your diet too.  I also started exercising.  I do yoga whenever the pain is gone.  When I am in pain I try to do some pool exersizing (hanging onto the side of the pool and just kicking my legs/stretching).  I find the pool is great because I can still get my body moving and stretching without relying on my legs to support my body.  My favorite thing I've done for myself is started to get massages.  I get massage twice a month.  The first one is my preventative massage.  This is usually about relaxation and mental health.  The second one is treatment specific.  I do a little reflexology related to the pelvic area and focus on my lower back, glutes, and legs since this is where I experience a lot of trouble.  It doesn't do much for the actual pain except centralize it to the pelvic area (it used to go up my back and down my legs), but I feel so much better on the whole. I also keep my pain killers handy.  I have codeine for the days that I have to work because it helps take away the pain without slowing down my mental capacities.  I also have percocet for the stay at home days because I mostly just sleep when I take one of those.  I had to experiment with different pain killers to find the ones that work best for me.   As for painful sex, this is something I go through too.  As someone else said, make sure you are fully turned on and really wanting sex.  That is the number one thing you can do to make it less painful.  I've also found that using a ton of lube helps too.  Make sure you keep open communication with your partner and that your partner is patient and willing to help you.  Experiment with different positions and see if there are any that are consistently bad or good.  I usually find positions where I am in control of speed, depth, etc are best.   I hope all works out for you.  I will say, the endometriosis community is one of the best.  There are often local meet ups people living with the disease.  There are also online communities.  If you ever need to talk feel free to PM me too.  I promise there are days where you will cry and be angry because of this.  Don't be afraid to feel that way.  We all have been there.  Those times pass.  Be patient, open to new ideas, and be willing to experiment with treatments.  You have a community here to support you!
As you may know one of the bonuses of the deluxe edition is a "tricked" out BMW M3 GTR from MW '05. Some people will greatly appreciate this as they may not enjoy or have the time to put the needed effort in the game and acquire money to get a good car and so on, but as a big NFS fan I'd like to really play the game, having to work to get money, and see my efforts turn into new parts and cars and such. I'm afraid starting out in a fully upgraded car might take away the point of the game for me, as you have already won the game in a kind of way when you have one of the best cars. I want my cars to be a reflection of myself, build them up from the ground myself, having to work for the money to upgrade it/buy a new one myself, which was supposed to be a big point of the game. I'd rather win races and such to get the M3 as a result of my effort, and therefore i'm in doubt if I should pick up the deluxe edition and get it right away, (I really want the exclusive parts and vinyls etc), or just go for the standard copy, but maybe that's just me.
Sensitive and possibly incriminating story so I made a throwaway.   I am an art teacher at a very well off high school. I replaced a teacher that left to go teach art at the college level. He was granted a one year leave of absence before he left last year. He uprooted his whole family and moved out of state to a very rural area. Couldn't sell his house here and now he's paying a double mortgage. His wife may lose her job as well so he is thinking of coming back at the end of this year.   The thing is, I was looking through this guy's old purchase orders and noticed that a few supplies he ordered were no longer here. What the hell? I look a little harder and notice that it's not just a few supplies, he ordered a shit ton of stuff for the department and I have good reason to believe that he took it all with him to the college- which makes zero fucking sense... doesn't the college have a budget?   So I start to tally up the amount of missing materials and equipment. It ends up being over $2000 worth of art supplies. I can't believe that this guy basically screwed over the department and stole supplies  from kids during a budget crisis when other teachers are losing their jobs! I was pretty close to this guy last year and I think he's a pretty decent man. He just had a kid and now I think he's all about his kid and not interested in being a college professor rock star. The thing is... I might lose my job if he comes back. At the very least I would be shifted around into a different area in the department. This teacher that is below me in seniority might get let go or have to teach at a different school in the district.   So I confront the guy. I ask where X, Y, and Z supplies are at, and he says that he left them in a cabinet. One of the things was a brand new piece of equipment worth $500 and he says he just FORGOT to tell me about it. Needless to say, the shit ain't here. Hasn't been all year and I don't think it ever was here. So now I figure he takes me for a complete dumbass. He also called my department chair and told him that I am trying to FRAME HIM like this is some sort of goddamn spy movie. I've spent untold hours in this department dedicating myself to this profession and he says that I HID the missing equipment in order to set him up!?!?   So my fellow educators, what be your verdict on this sketchy activity? If he comes back and pushes me out of my current position I'll never forgive myself. I have a wife and kid at home and this job is my life. I love teaching and have dedicated myself to teaching my students with %100 of my energy. There is no WAY that I would ever think of ripping the place off- much less come crawling back on all fours to take back the job I stole from. &#3232;_&#3232;
I am M30, Ex is F31, New Woman is F23   Ex of 2 years was someone with a high conflict psychologically abusive personality. Many times she was a nice girl, but just like anyone who is abusive the bad times kinda stuck out. She broke up with me after i asked her to stop being abusive. Everything about her I know is bad for me. I've accepted that she's gone (hell CELEBRATED at one point) and met someone new after 2 weeks at a get together my friends were throwing one afternoon. My ex's family knew me and adored me. My parents did not like her because they could see her for what she was.   We've been seeing each other for about 3 weeks, and she is simply an amazing good hearted person, affectionate, patient, passionate, understanding, has critical thinking ability (ie not crazy and throwing accusations around), has an ability to reason out situations without being paranoid. It's a complete 180 from what I am used to, and I think I am really starting to fall for this woman. It's scary because she actually is a lot like me in many ways and shares many of the values I do, whereas my ex did not. We have been appropriately open about our pasts (not giving specifics of breakups and such, just the general types of people we have dated and our general experiences) and appear to share similar live experiences that have developed similar values. Similar interests shared. She has a mature outlook on life due to her hard life and upbringing and she has not let that hold her back - going from extremely poor to about to enter school to get her masters for a promising career. Only downside is that the new girl may be leaving for BC in a year to complete her degree so that makes me a little nervous to start anything.   With this new interest I am also kinda worried that if I DO end up falling for her hard - and she moves away (while I actually may be able to do so as well moving cross country is hard) that it may hit me doubly hard at the end.   Now I know it's supposed to be bad to compare qualities of people as they are always different people, but I literally am amazed I met this person. We have been taking things slow (did not have any sex for 2 weeks after meeting) and have generally just learned to appreciate eachother's company.   After we broke up, my ex and I had tried to be friends - although her high conflict personality became an issue, and I had chosen to inform her of her behaviour and that I would not accept that in my life anymore. I broke off all contact with her (to the point of standing near her at a transit platform and completely ignoring her glares) I have avoided looking at any social media/blogs that my ex maintains about her personal life, our many mutual friends have not heard me bashing her where she has apparently been talking badly about me (people have told me i have not asked), and generally attempted to keep myself very grounded and having a mature outlook on things while getting back into shape and enjoying the company of my friends. My confidence level is up. I seem happy and have a good outlook on the future that is rational and level headed. I can work without being hung up on what happened and overall am doing damned well.   The problem is, that I am still angry about my ex being a bitch to me, and somewhat sad she is gone even though she was a bitch to me. I've accepted in my head that this is whats best, rationally reasoned what the reasons were for her behaviour (jealousy of my abilities in an industry we share, her child liked me more than her, I inspired people, I was able to do things in my life she could not, I had a good relationship with my parents whereas she did not), I've also discovered there is a chance she cheated on me as well and that actually doesn't make me as angry as I'd expect. More like slightly sad/dissapointed how things turned out with her and between us. Maybe it's more that she was unable to empathize with how her behaviour and attitude made me feel and thinking "if she were able to i would have been happy". No - conversations about this did not work as her perception of everything is always that shes right and I am the crazy one. Ive always been open to discussing sides of perception where she is not or wont accept someone else's point of view. She also always was never able to give me the positive benefit of the doubt with any intent of action. asking her how her day was would, for instance, get an accusation thrown at me that I was tracking her movements.   When we broke up I was depressed and despondent, but did not shed one tear or stob/cry once. I actually have kept a surprisingly even temper over the whole thing, but sometimes I do miss her when alone, but not to the point of wanting to call her/txt her. The sex wasn't that good (didn't have any for the last 2 months of our relationship anyways) and we hadn't had a really good or conflict free time with each other for 6 months. Overall, once I had identified my ex was insane and it was not my fault, I was able to move on with my life, realize that I am better off, and not let what happened hold me back, but I still sometimes dwell on what happened.   What I am afraid of is that although this new woman is amazing, that my feelings for her are emotions resulting from rebound. When thinking of this new girl, I honestly feel happy - I smile, my heart flutters like it hasn't in some time, I want to see her even when I know I am unable to due to schedule whereas with my ex it was a chore, I admire her for her strength and character, I check her out when she thinks im not looking, I love having her in my arms, and I can sleep next to her peacefully and wake up thinking of her instead of my ex when I do. But, when Im alone at home I sometimes think back to my ex with a slight feeling of loneliness/anger/sadness - nothing major or not all the time (but enough over the past few weeks to seriously ask for some advice.   I am not usually one to jump into a relationship right away after breaking up with someone (6-8 months to over a year in between relationships due to grieving process, just wanting to be single) I am nowhere near as broken up about things as I was in relationships past, but I did honestly love her despite her faults, and for the person she was, but feel that I had moved on emotionally quite quickly in many ways.   OVERALL, the breakup has not affected how I act around my new interest nor has her behaviour made me think of my ex.   I guess I'm asking if anyone else has had similar experiences, were able to accept things fairly easily and move on quickly, meet someone new, and had things turn out ok. Am I crazy? Is what I am going through normal? What can I do to learn to appreciate the new woman in my life better and the time (potentially short lived) we are going to spend together? Anyone have any experience in this and end up moving to a completely different city where neither knows anyone else and have things turn out ok?
I've been in two horrible relationships that messed me up pretty bad. I was on the side lines for my parents gruesome divorce. These things combine have made me pretty good at compartmentalizing my feelings. Last August upon returning to school I met an awesome guy and we instantly became friends soon after we started sleeping together. We weren't sleeping with anyone else, this when on for the entire school year. At the end of the spring semester we had the "what are we" talk that I had been avoiding for quite awhile. We decided based on our summer plans being exclusive didn't make any sense. It wasn't until then that I actually sat down and sorted out my actual feelings, I realized how much I actually like him. He's the first person I've let myself like since my last boyfriend of three years that ended in 2009. I suppressed these feelings and went about my summer, flirting with boys, hooking up, enjoying myself.   Now we're back to school and we started to hang out again quickly getting back into our old routine. I was laying in bed this morning looking at him and I couldn't stop thinking. I thought about my past and then I thought about all the things I want in a relationship, out of another person and what I want from myself. I realized I'm so lost. I don't want to get myself into anything that I can't handle, I'm trying to graduate and what not. Every part of me wants him and only him. I don't like seeing him with other people and the idea of him being with someone else drives me crazy. But I feel like there is almost a wall that blocks me from wanting a relationship in anyway because they have always plagued my life. I used to be so good at keeping our relationship in two separate worlds one where we were just awesome friends and then the other where we had casual sex with no complication.   I want it to stay easy, carefree and uncomplicated but I don't know if I can keep those two worlds apart anymore. I thought about this for over an hour. I started to get really upset and I didn't want him to see me so upset because I didn't want to have to explain myself. I left quietly as to not wake him, pretended I was fine socialized with his housemates so nothing seemed odd, went home and had myself a good shower cry.   Now I'm just sitting in my room wondering why I'm so fucking broken and how to fix myself. I'm at a loss and I know that my loss is partially based in fear of change. I haven't really asked a question here so I guess I'm just looking for someone who has had a similar situation to give me some advise on how to get over myself and deal with it. Thank you for anyone who sat down and read this long and slightly whiny post.
I blacked out in downtown Cleveland.  I shattered my phone, broke my nose, lost my group and got saakio.  I didn't eat any because on my ride home I was really pissed for some reason and threw it out the window on the highway.  I also lost over a hundred bucks somehow.
Cops in the town I went to college for were notorious for shit like this.   They'd basically stop people walking down the street if they appeared in any way intoxicated or if they were carrying alcohol (like if you were going to or from a party) and if they found your keys? They'd play with the fob to see how close your car was. Drunk and within range of your car locks? Time to go to the station.   Fuckin crooked cops, literally would whip my keys across the street if I saw a cop coming down the road and I was walking home from a party.
Every single day I just sit in front of the computer, at home. I have very few friends that I barely spend time with. It's really, really lonely. I think the last time I hung out with a friend was over a week ago, and before that, I can't even remember.   I don't know how to make friends at all. I have very bad social anxiety, and I have Asperger's, so I'm always in my own little world. Whenever we have family gatherings I always hide in some room by myself, doing my own thing. I like to spend a lot of time by myself, but at the same time, I really don't. I don't want to be by myself all the time. I wish I had someone to spend time with. The few friends I do have either moved away or have a job, so I rarely talk to them.   I pretty much missed out on the teenage experience, you know, never been kissed or had a gf, or been to a party, or hanging out with friends every weekend, you know. I didn't talk to people in school that much, and I rarely went over to people's houses to hang out. I spent pretty much all of my time by myself. Do people really have plans every Friday or Saturday? It just seems like another day to me. I never have plans.   And now I'm 19 and attending a local college while still living with mom and dad, and I still haven't even had my first job. I've tried applying, but no luck yet. Being the youngest of three children, my mom is very overprotective of me and doesn't really let me do much by myself. So I don't see her letting me move out any time soon, and it's not like I could, having no job and all.   I would like to make more friends but I'm very introverted, to the point where people point out "You don't talk much." Well thanks for reminding me. It's really frustrating, I want to talk to people and make friends but I'm just not an interesting person. It's probably no surprise but I'm an anime/game nerd, which I love, but I believe is ruining my life. And not everybody likes that kind of stuff, and I don't have many other interests, so what the heck am I supposed to talk to other people about? I really want to make friends but unless I'm attending anime conventions every other weekend I don't really see that happening.   And then the other thing, I am very insecure about the fact that I've never had a girlfriend. I feel like if I keep living the life I live now as a shut-in, I will always be alone. I am a very jealous person, and my jealousies and insecurities are intensified when I realize everyone I know is in a relationship. It was kind of awkward at Easter, sitting at a table with all my similarly aged relatives and siblings, who are all in relationships except me. And then they never shut up about their boyfriends or girlfriends. It's so bad that I get depressed just at the sight of the word "bf/gf".   The worst part is that I am a lesbian, and my mom is completely unsupportive of it. I absolutely hate being a lesbian, I hate the world lesbian. It's just not fair. I hate it so much. The more I think about it the worse I feel. Just thinking about it makes me cry, I hate it so much. Anyway my mom notices I'm depressed, and freaks out about it, and one particular day she said "So what's wrong with you? Aside from the usual crap." Usual crap, meaning me being lesbian. She literally refuses to talk to me about it. She hates lgbt people so much, I bet if they all died she would think "good riddance". My dad is too uncomfortable to talk to me about my insecurities either. My siblings both moved away so I don't really get to talk to them that much. Thankfully, they're more supportive. But in any case, I don't get much emotional support from anyone so I feel awful all the time. There are no lgbt youth support groups in my area, and my college doesn't have one either.   Oh yeah and also I have pretty bad self-esteem issues. I am a decent weight, but I feel ugly. Every time I look in the mirror I see my ugly face. I found a video with me on it and when I watched it, I cried because I looked so ugly. I was happily unaware of how ugly I looked. Short hair, ultra-thick eyebrows. I don't know how to smile so it comes out as some kind of "trying not to laugh" face. I also have bad posture and inherited the "no chin" from my mom. I've only been asked out once, and it was by a guy. I really wish I wasn't a lesbian because if I wasn't, then it would have worked out great. But no, I have to be a lesbian. And the worst part is, that was probably the only chance at forming a relationship I'll ever get in my entire life. One time I was feeling especially lonely so I joined Okcupid, but that didn't really work out so I just gave up at that.   I just want to have friends. I love to go out and go to stores, the park, the mall, you know. But I barely get to do that. It's a special occasion to me, and it shouldn't. It should be a regular occurrence. But I don't know how to make friends. How do you even talk to people?
Yeah, although I had to tough out a year of being her roommate first.   She never had a roommate (didn't even live in the dorms freshman year), so she never learned how to deal with sharing a space with people. We had a pretty good friendship before we moved in together, but she got annoyed by the slightest of things, and she let these annoyances build up and up without ever mentioning anything to me. There was no way I could have known, during board game night, that when we chose to consult the rules book during a rules dispute, I was ACTUALLY supposed to just listen to her and doing anything else was a huge insult to her.   I learned very quickly that I was expected to read her mind to see what she wanted done around the house and what I was supposed to say around her. She saw herself as being above having to do housework or clean up after herself because she lived with "such immature people", but she would freak out if we didn't keep everything clean and tidy for her. (Note: my other roommates and I definitely weren't slobs, but we weren't perfect all the time!)   She also had a huge victim complex, where everything that went wrong in her life was the direct result of everyone else being out to get her. She had a system of enabling family members on Facebook who would comfort and support her whenever she posted a rant about her horrible roommates (which we could all read, because we were FB friends).   The kicker was at the end of the year when she wanted to resign the lease together for another year. She honestly had no idea she was behaving horribly and making everyone miserable (even though we tried bridging the gap many times, but obviously everything was our fault). We gave her a collective "hell no" and cut her out of our lives forever.
you can get a dent puller from somewhere like Canadian Tire or Lordco. Its basically just a giant super suction cup for under $20.00 that will pull out dents to a certain degree. They won't always work 100% and especially on smaller dings, but they do often make the dents more shallow (even small sharp hits like that).   Moreover, you seem to have come off lucky because that ding doesn't look to have actually penetrated the colour coats as it isnt white or metallic where the damage is. After doing the dent pull for a few hours and some light elbow grease, you should be able to just get a decent quality wax/polish/scratch remover to shine up the scuff again. Often times, if the colour layer is damaged, youll end up seeing the white or black primer underneath or bare metal, not dulled colour.   If by some chance damage was done to the colour layer, you can also pick up small vials of matched paint from an official dealership of whatever car you own then try your hand at that. Note that this method is realy only good for small chips or thin scratches in paint for best effect. Painting over a quarter size scratch will end you up with a crappy finish for the everyman.   You'll find that its not worth the mental trouble to go after people for damages like this, and your parents as lawyers should know this concept very well.
A bit of Googlin' has lead me to the answer that "mark as watched" isn't a feature.   This is awful. How does a company like Google go years without implementing such a basic feature?   Well, enough complaining. Is there any way to at least dismiss subscription notices? YouTube will display numbers next to my subscribed channels.   For those who care: basically, I watch videos on my phone, but YouTube doesn't recognize that I've watched said video (could be the app, I'm on Windows Phone).   If I click "hide these videos" I'm guessing it will stop showing me that type of content altogether. Which isn't what I want.
As an every-day NYC commuter, and an avid League of Legends player, I have those moments where I overhear League talk. Now, the problem is, I am just a skinny white freshmen kid, and these guys I overhear talking are juniors and seniors. On one hand, I would like to introduce myself, meet some new people, and play some League, but I feel intimidated. The people I overhear range from Bronze to Gold(east coast ping pls), and I m around silver 2, so it's not intimidation concerning elo. It's just the age barrier. I m so used to people making fun of my appearance that I am scared(don't get me wrong here either, most of the time I just shrug it off, but it sticks with you, you know?), but at the same time I would like to meet other League players to play with instead of spamming solo-queue. I don't know what to do. Does anyone else feel the same way?
Mini story time..   After I broke up with my long term girlfriend (2.5 years), she got really obsessive. She found out that I was hanging out with a new girl (not the reason her and I broke up, she was acting really shady, and admitted to doing stuff with another guy while on vacation with friends) and began somewhat stalking me. One night in particular, I was sitting on my bed, talking to said girl on the phone. I heard a noise outside, and thought I saw something when I looked. I had a really weird feeling that it was her. So I called out her name. A few seconds later my door opened and she came in my room. I ended the call and asked what she was doing. She pretty much instantly jumped at me and tried to take off my pants.. She had this really weird devilish/desperate look in her eyes, and muttered something along the lines of  I just want to please you , I kept telling her no and pushing her away. I finally shoved her off of me and went into my kitchen.. When I came back into my room I told her she needed to leave.
Just a few years ago I was in a similar situation to yours, Tik. Throughout high school, and into my first couple years of college, I was an avid procrastinator. I had a kind of reputation as the quiet nerdy kid who never studied and aced all the tests, but my problem was the homework! You put me in a classroom and I'd listen to every word the teacher said, absorb all the infos, understand the content, blah blah... but once I got sent home it would be straight to the xbox (I blame Oblivion for all my problems back then :P). The end of the semester (or marking period, whatever it happened to be) would come along, and I'd have all this missing work that my teacher might let me do for half credit. Taking a look at my grades, I'd figure out that if I aced the test I could squeak out a B or so, so I'd stress out and study a bit and sometimes it worked. Most times the plan backfired and there'd be a C (or the Dreaded D) on my report card, and I'd bring shame to my famiry. I'd promise myself that next semester I'd try harder, and never again put myself in that situation. I always did though; I was never really able to develop any real self-discipline until a few months ago (I'm almost 22 now, better late than never, eh?).   Enough storytime though, you want all my ancient wisdom. You know yourself better than anyone, so take some time to figure out exactly which of your choices you want to take. If you honestly don't think you'll be able to balance out your remaining Calculus work with your other classes before the final, maybe that will have to take the cut. If you think you can put your nose to the grindstone and knock it all out without completely stressing yourself out, then do your best and get that math credit here and now. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, or so I've heard. ;)   Coming from someone who's repeatedly kicked myself in the metaphorical butt for putting myself in this kind of situation, my advice is to do your absolute best to do as much of the work as you can. It may be a stressful few days/weeks, but you'll love your past self much more when you come out of it.   Either way, look out for your future self and kick those procrastinating habits now before they really start to hinder your progress on your goals. You'll love yourself all the more for it. :)   Good luck with whatever you choose! Calc was a beast, but I found it easier than precalc at least. ;) (I rhymed!)
When I was a kid my grandmother gave my Ghost in the Shell on VHS (she had no idea what it was, just a movie) for christmas. Intro sequence is a nude woman being sloshed around in "provocative" poses. She saw that, left the room. The next time she passes and looks in it's another scene when Kusanagi is nude. The next time she saw me watching an anime a few months later it was Street Fighter, she managed to time Chun-Li taking a shower.
Today, my 2012 Fiat Linea 1.8 E-TorQ, equipped with a semi-auto Dualogic transmission did not start. Instead, it shows many notifications on the dashboard (respectively parking sensor, ABS, EBD, Air Bag failure). It will not start no matter what, not even react when I try to start it. Can't service it right now ad I'm far away from a dealer, and Fiat is ABSOLUTELY incompetent in fixing this car. As you see, it has only 27k kilometers (16k miles), it's been serviced many times, but because of lesser problems (such as GPS navigator and sound system not working), and already replaced a steering rack that leaked about 6 months ago. It's still under manufacturer warranty (3 years), it expires next month.
She is probably taking this photo with an Iphone. There appears to be an empty case next to her right arm. Wouldn't she have looked at the preview? It would have been hard not to.. especially if she was looking at the camera.
I'm in a fairly fucked up situation, that has the potential of becoming REALLY fucked up, really fast.   When I was younger I got hooked on meth (snorting it) and it went south really fast. I was selling, binge-using, lying cheating and the whole 9. Lost basically everything.   Somehow I had a "moment of clarity" or whatever you want to call it, and checked myself into rehab. After a pretty long stint in treatment, I came out feeling pretty good.   I stayed 100% sober for a few years, then I started drinking again. I didn't think alcohol was really my problem. I was "kind of" right; I was able to go on drinking for years without any major external consequences - i.e. kept my job, paid my bills, came to work on time, showered etc. Maintained long-term relationships with friends and family (who were, incidentally, pretty much all hard drinkers as well). Never went back to drugs, except the occasional one-night blowout with some coke or pain pills - but those never turned into binges or habits.   Fast forward, got married and had a daughter. After she was born I reduced my drinking to socially-acceptable levels, albeit with the help of some ex-hard-drinkers who leant support. So everything was going fine.   Then my wife had an affair, and I chose to react in a really selfish and irresponsible way. I moved out for a while and got in the habit of binge drinking, sleeping around and smoking cigarettes (I hadn't smoked since I quit drugs). Even so I stayed employed and reasonably respectable, no 'major' fuckups.   Well, my wife and I decided to try to make it work for our daughter's sake, and because we still love each other. It's been tough, but definitely has its upsides, and I'm very grateful to get to live with my kid.   OK, enter plot twist. We moved to a new city for work opportunities, and she has some family here. I don't really know anyone here, and I guess that helped me feel "anonymous" and not really accountable. Right away I started binge drinking, going out to bars way too late, smoking etc. Then one night I met a girl and went back to her place. For the record, my wife and I made the decision to work on our friendship first and if that goes well, then possibly become romantic partners again in the future. But for the time being we sleep in different rooms, and we agreed it's OK to have one-night stands occasionally if the need and opportunity arises. So this girl busts out a bag (of meth of course) and starts cutting up lines. And I'm pretty much blacked out at this point. My memory becomes super clear about 2 minutes after snorting the stuff, thinking Oh Fuck, What Did I Just Do. However in my high state, despite my regret/terror, I had her introduce me to her dealer and got his number.   After that I left it alone for about a week. Then one night I came up with some dumbshit rationalization ("it'll help me do better at work!") and went and bought a bag. My theory was that if I only eat it in small quantities, and come down every night and sleep, I'd be OK.   So that was about a month ago. I've been eating it almost every morning. Quantity-wise I am at a really lightweight level, when I think back to my tweaker days. I've gone through about 1.5g in a month, that used to be half a day for me.   The reason I mention that is, it sort of seems like there's a window open now where if I can just stop, I'm not gonna have a huge comedown or withdrawals. I've skipped a day two or three times, and skipped 2 days once, without huge consequences- just felt tired.   There's pretty much no one I can talk to. If this blows up I'll lose my job, kid, standing with my family & her family - everything. Obviously if it gets really bad I'll have to go to rehab again, but when I think about the damage that would do to my daughter, it seems like a last resort.   Last time I quit I was in an insulated environment (rehab), had tons of support, counselors, no access to intoxicants, etc etc. Now I'm in a position where I've gotta quit, and keep living a normal life in the meantime. The nature of my job is such that I can't take time off without a damn good reason. And even then I might get a couple days at most. Basically I got in early at a startup and every day of work counts right now, it's make-or-break time. And there's only 6 of us. So I can't just duck out.   OK that was super long winded. Anyways, I'm in this headspace of "how the fuck did I get here again??". My actions don't feel like my own. I love my daughter dearly and she deserves a sober and sane father. I have to find a way out.   So far no one has really noticed anything, except that I look tired all the time, which I blame on work and insomnia. I've been coming down at least enough to sleep a couple hours every night, so I'm not having any paranoia or hallucinations yet. I'm still essentially functional.   If anyone out there has had to quit on their own, I'm desperate for any advice. Honestly even just to talk to someone and be honest about this would be a huge release. I feel completely alone. Thanks in advance to anyone who reaches out.   P.S. I don't know if this came across, but I understand and accept that I am 100% responsible for my actions - my choosing to poison myself is not the fault of anyone else. I can swallow that one. And I know it's not anyone else's responsibility to help me. Just gotta try something.
I'll be using the version performed by [The Toyes]( because it is the most detailed version I know of.   Assuming that this guy is chronicling an average day in his life; I'll tally up the number of roaches this guy is sucking down. Let's start it off...       Lyric   Number of Joints           I smoke two joints in the morning   2       I smoke two joints at night   2       I smoke two joints in the afternoon   2       It makes me feel alright   😎       I smoke two joints in time of peace   2       and two in time of war   Wait a minute...         Hold that joint!   How do we know if this guys homeland is at peace or war? Believe it or not, these guys hail from Oregon. I had to confer with my brother on this one as he was very interested as well and he stated 'We're at war with countries in the Middle East, but we're at peace with Canada'. I decided to accept this as a reasonable answer, because through stoner logic, you're probably going to try to get away with smoking as many joints as possible.   Moving on...       Lyric   Number of Joints           I smoke two joints in the morning   2       I smoke two joints at night   2       I smoke two joints in the afternoon   2       It makes me feel alright   😎       I smoke two joints in time of peace   2       and two in time of war   2       I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints   2       And then I smoke two more   2...?         I think I ran out of fingers to count on..   So I thought this was just the guy explaining that he was smoking 6 random joints, but my brother saw through the haze on this one and brought up a very important observation: 'Does that mean for every two joints, he smokes four more?' And that's when a revelation hits, he does smoke six joints every time. Now we have to account for these extra four joints that are bundled in here.       Lyric   Number of Joints   Pre-game Joints   Chaser Joints           I smoke two joints in the morning   2   2   2         I smoke two joints at night   2   2   2         I smoke two joints in the afternoon   2   2   2         It makes me feel alright   😎   👍   😂         I smoke two joints in time of peace   2   2   2         and two in time of war   2   2   2         I smoke two joints when I get up   2   2   2         In the car I smoke two joints   2   2   2         I smoke two joints when I play video game   2   2   2         And at every ten thousand points   2   2   2           High score?   We were nearly finished when he threw his last curve ball at us, we don't know anything about this guy's gaming habits! We would need to know what game he was playing, how many points are possible, and how well he could possibly play when he is this burnt out. For the sake of this post, I'm going to assume he didn't even make it to 1,000 points (I know I probably couldn't)   Grand Total   So with 9 instances of doping,   and 6 spliffs per session,   He smokes 48 joints throughout the day, plus 6 joints for every 10,000 points in whatever games he plays
So this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I have a bit of an issue. I've had a friend who I've known for about 4 years now, we dated twice but now are only friends. (Names are being changed just in case)   I met Will when I was about 15, he was introduced to me by my best friend and we found that we actually had quite a bit in common. His 15th birthday was coming up so he invited me, my best friend, and his best friend. While at the party we started playing videogames and he, without prompting, kissed me. I was a bit confused, but he admitted he found me quite attractive and wouldn't mind dating.   For the first while our relationship was great. He was everything I wanted in a relationship and treated me really great; but as time went on he started getting distant and we ended up breaking up because of this. I was a little bent up, because he was my first love but I eventually put it behind me and we became close friends again.   Fast forward 2 years to when we're both 17, he kisses me again during an outing and confesses that he's sorry for the way things went last time and wants to try again. I agreed, but it barely lasted. We ended up breaking up again after a month, his doing without giving me a reason as to why.   We're still friends, and now we work together which I'm perfectly okay with. But a few days ago I ended up spending the night at his house with our friend group after a night of drinking (I live in Canada, 18 is legal here); in the morning I went into his room to ask how he was doing because he was out the earliest and he prompted me to cuddle which was followed by him calling me pretty over and over again. After this he kissed me once and when I pushed him away telling him not to play this game again, he asked me to come over but when prompted about coming over he feigned that he couldn't remember saying that and apologized if he had crossed a boundary.   I don't understand what's up with him?
Yeah   I had a bad habit of smoking a serious amount when I went drinking, I just couldn't resist. Beer and cigarettes go together so fucking well.   I realised i was in a bad way when I coughed so much it felt like my lungs/windpipe had collapsed, and I had to think mentally "do not panic, just force your chest out to inhale". This happened 3 or 4 times.   That was when I quit smoking for good, even when drunk, its the only New Years Resolution I have ever made and I stuck to it - since then I think I have had maybe 1 cig in 2 years and 9 months.
First of all, it seems like it was located on the person's back, making it very hard for them to see it remove on there own. Secondly, blackheads are not necessarily indicative of poor hygiene. Blackheads (aka Comedones) basically form when the there is abnormal shedding of skin cells in the opening of the pore which results in obstruction of the pore. Sebum, and other normal products from the pore build up and push outward forming. Eventually, this material is exposed to air and oxidizes, turning black (whiteheads are unexposed material). None of these steps requires poor hygiene, and all can can occur despite daily cleaning.
Our marriage has been in a downward spiral for a while now.  It became difficult for me to show affection and to become intimate.  She has always been very sexually ...ready to go, I guess, and has told me several times that she doesn't want to live in a sexless marriage.  I kept trying as things grew worse, because I wanted her to be satisfied.  I felt awkward forcing myself to have sex, though, and it was a chore.   I've always been a socially awkward person.  I have diagnosed myself with avoidant personality disorder.  I've just always cared more about what people think of me than I should, it's hard for me to deal with anything, I procrastinate and avoid conflict.  So, I've been isolated in the house, a house which is never clean.  I'm flunking out of college.  There are a lot of reasons for her to be unhappy, but in truth I didn't really care.  The idea of a separation bothered me, but not a great deal.  I looked forward to getting my own place, being responsible for my own messes, having complete control of my home environment.   All that changed last weekend.  My wife was at work and I had the daughter.  I decided I would have a few beers while watching the Saturday football games and interacting with my daughter.  I had a few too many and my wife came home and was very angry about it.  Which was her right, she was right to be angry about me sitting at home drunk with our preschooler.  I reacted to her anger with my own anger.  I brought back up facebook messages of hers where she'd insulted me to her friends.  I grew more and more angry and raised my voice, used some expletives, punched a banister at one point.  All of this in front of our daughter.  She felt threatened, even though I've never touched her and I never would.  I was just trying to vent my anger.  Nevertheless she was frightened and took my daughter and left and took her with her to work the next day.   I realized what a fool I'd been the next day.  I've apologized profusely and made every promise.  To not drink or be drunk in her or my daughter's presence again, I meant it.  To get marriage counseling like she always wanted, I meant it.  When I saw that we really were going to get separated, I became filled with fear, anxiety, sorrow, regret.  I've felt this deep and intense feeling that the world is a cold, harsh place and if I'm left alone in it, I won't be able to make it.     She doesn't respond to any of my attempts to be near her, to cuddle in bed, to kiss goodbye.  She's now treating me like a roommate that she dislikes but is too polite to say so.  She still wants the separation.  In my attempts to communicate the depth of my sorrow and regret to her and my promises to do better, I'm sure I've sounded whiny to her.  I'm sure that doesn't help my case, but I can't let this end without her knowing that I know I was wrong and want to change.  It's like talking to an indifferent wall, though.  I think she'll go through with the separation and I don't know if I'll be able to recover from it.
Before I realized I wasn't straight, I thought it would be convenient and cool to be bisexual. I was naiive at the time, and had no idea how much stigma bisexuals actually face, even as gays and lesbians gain more and more acceptance.  Still, I'm internally very comfortable with my sexuality. Sure, others might not like it, but other people are dicks sometimes, and that's life. If it wasn't me liking boys, it'd be something else.  The other thing is that I do lean to the gay side as it were, I think I'm a Kinsey 4 iirc. This is, on the whole, less "convenient" than I'd imagined because I end up being attracted to a lot of straight boys and girls who are basically out of my league. Even so, I  really like  liking boys, no matter what social implications it has. It gives me a good feeling, and I can't imagine being any other way.
I work in a small office. There is one person in particular that really enjoys planning birthday lunches and celebrating every little insignificant event. The problem is that there is no office budget that she depends on. Instead, she just e-mails the rest with the breakdown of the costs and how much we need to pay her. It is $20/week on average that I have to put out to celebrate the birthdays of people that only yell at me and food I do not eat.   Today was the last straw: She decided to go buy some breakfast treats and some other "goodies" for "bosses day." I had no clue until I go her e-mail saying how much it was and how much I owe.   I am sure that most of you will be saying "$20/week get over it." Well, unfortunately $20/week is a shit load of money for me. And even if it was just chump change, the principle of the whole thing is just fucked.   So I ask you, Reddit, how the hell do you "politely" opt out without being labeled as "not being a team player"? Even if I opt out, whoever's birthday is being celebrated will then get upset because I did not participate and it will start snowballing into this huge stupid shit...fucking politics.
Okay so this is a long stretch I've never met anyone who can remember the title of this book and I have been looking for over two years on and off for it.   Description: From what I can remember in the book has large pages and was spiral bound with a hard cover landscape layout and mostly a picture book. In the book  there are two "teams" per say of dinosaures (good team were green and yellowish colored ones and the bad were purple and blackish gray) good and bad as well as gnomes or elves of some sort the pages showed like a cross section diagram of the elf tree houses and how they worked also showed I also remember one page showing large dinosaurs with like wooden saddles or almost embattlements strapped to them made of wood with other "woodland" creatures riding inside preparing for war. The last page in the book was a huge table under a tree and both teams had made amends and were eating. Thats all i can remember. I lost the book years ago and would love to get a copy so I can have it one day for my children.   Thanks!
so I was lounging playing skyrim (as if i do anything else these days) in black long johns & had to use the restroom. On the way I came across a black hoodie & red scarf & a couple belts. It was too perfect. So with my best dark brotherhood attempt (given what i had) donned, i 'snuck' back in to the living room and my two boxadors went fucking apeshit. I couldn't get my face exposed quickly enough. So i may stand a chance if anyone ever puts a black sacrament on me.
I'd hold you to a different standard because I'd be considering  you  as a potential relationship partner, not the man.  Would I treat either of you differently on a day-to-day if you both slept with 30 randoms?  No, because a person's number doesn't matter to me at all in terms of friendship.  However, it  does  matter to me in a serious relationship, so yes, I would hold you to a different standard than the man because I'd be trying to assess whether you and I would be compatible or not.
For the first time in years, I really like someone, and it terrifies me. I'm 21 haven't been in a relationship in which I genuinely liked the other person in about 5 years, and haven't really had much experience since then. This guy is really really great, since trading cell numbers and friending one another on facebook, we've been talking nearly nonstop for the past week or so. We are alike in nearly every aspect, and where we differ we complement one another very well (he is impulsive whereas I am more reserved, etc).   However, within the past few days I have become extremely anxious about the prospect of a relationship. Nothing in our interaction has changed and there's no conscious reasoning, I'm not thinking "oh this is a bad idea because of X," but I'm filled with a paralyzing fear. It feels like a fight or flight response where I am on edge and do not find the idea of a relationship to anyone, let alone him, attractive in the slightest. Rationally I know that this is silly, but it feels much more like a purely physical response as opposed to thinking something and then responding anxiously.   I've spoken with him about it and he is incredibly supportive. He too has had issues with anxiety and can relate to it perfectly, and I generally calm down after a good talk and feel much more okay and normal. But it seems like every day when I first see him in the morning at school, I tense up again and have to be talked down again. I know that this anxiety isn't really directed at him, because in a previous attempt at a relationship I felt the same response but had chalked it up to a lack of attraction, but I'm fairly sure that that's not the case here. I feel like I'm going to keep being faced with this, and I couldn't ask for a better person to talk me down and make me feel safe and sane. I so desperately want this to work, I like him a lot and could not ask for more, but there's something in me that's not letting me pursue it.   I've been trying to think of reasons for this, and have come up with a couple possibilities.   1) The last serious relationship I was in, I got hurt really really badly and didn't get over it for about a year and my whole life seemed to fall apart. I may have made a deep-set association between intimacy (emotional or physical) and that feeling of anguish.   2) He is not physically my ideal, as he is shorter than I am (I'm 5'2, he's 5'1). However, I've never been particularly concerned about physical looks, and when it comes to sexuality I'm not very visual, I'm more interested in how things feel, if that makes sense. Still, the fact that we fit so well in every other facet should override this, right?   3) He is four years younger than me, making him 17. Again, this is something that I rationally overlook, what's age but a number, etc, but I think I am still concerned with how it may appear to others.   So, thoughts? Is there anything that I can really do to get over this? I continue to talk to him at length about this and so far all we've come up with is having a bit of alone time in the mornings to talk so that I can calm myself down and relax for the rest of the day, but it feels a bit excessive to need to have something like that on a daily basis. Now going to try to handle it by texting him in the morning right when I start feeling the anxiety coming on rather than waiting and letting it snowball, and letting me have more control and setting the pace, going to see how that works.
I was working for a well known hardware company here in the UK, I was on a temp contract but was good at my job, got on with everyone and whilst other people had been let go due to finances I was being given as much overtime as I wanted and could almost pick my own shifts.   I've been there about five and half months and the head of another department asks for me to be part of her staff, so I move across and all is going well until she asks me if I can work nights, 9pm-6am. Obviously as I'm after all the money I can get and enjoy the job I have no issues.   The shift I was working overlapped slightly with a friend and with hardly anyone else in we took liberties, I didn't see anything wrong with slacking off for 20 minutes as I worked my ass off every other minute and didn't take breaks. It's in the middle of the planking craze and I said friend had been impressed with my efforts he had seen on Facebook so started looking for places i could plank in store. He bets me I cant plank on the top of the 25ft ladders we had, so naturally I prove him wrong and he takes the picture which I then put on Facebook to a host of 'likes'.   Come Friday nothing has been said about this incident and I'm back in work at 3pm back on regular shifts. I'm running a little late but seeing as I finished at 6am I wasn't too fussed. I get to work and after about 20 minutes I hear my name called over the tannoy. I go up and sit in managers office completely oblivious to whats about to happen. He pulls up a picture on his PC of me on top of the ladders and I shit myself.   He reluctantly suspended me pending an investigation and it was left to another manager to do my first disciplinary, it was my old department manager, I'm thinking he will help me out. Wrong, he passes me on to second 'hearing' with the one manager I don't get on with due to the 'severity of the incident'. That comes around and she gleefully tells me that if I had six months service it would be down as a formal warning but as I had been there five and a half, a formal was not an option, it was dismissal or informal warning and the actions were too severe to warrant an informal warning.
Dammit... I just got bit by the bug again... For 2 whole years, the computer I built was awesome. It was more than adequate for everything. One of the most powerful yet suuuuper efficient computer I've ever built after 18 years of PC building. It cost next to nothing to be on and had tons of speed, room, and power. Then, cut to the release of Tomb Raider... fuck, stutter here and there. Oh well, turn down the settings a little bit. Then, there's a sale for Sleeping Dogs... fuck, stutter. Turn down the setting even more. Maybe I should upgrade... nah, (insert excuse here). Then, there's a sale for Watch Dogs... fuck, stutter. I'm just going to look up a GPU on ebay. Next thing I know, I'm 3 hours deep on ebay. Place a bid and I win a used r9 280x for $125 and I'm STOKED! Now I'm looking up cpus and mobos, ram, friggin' crossfire rigs... I'm in deep, brother...
I recently had some brain surgery where a part of the skull and parts of the top two vertebrae were removed to allow more room for cerebrospinal fluid to flow through (the condition I had is called Chiari Malformation Type 1 for those interested).   Five days later and I'm still in hospital. Today I vomited three times so a drip was put on me again. I've been poked and prodded more times than ever in my life, but the worst part is the neck pain I currently have. My neck is so stiff that the only way I can explain how it feels is when I try to turn it, it's like trying to stretch a rubber band further than possible. If I strain in any way, again, sudden pang of head pain because of the cerebrospinal fluid rushing up/down. This means I've been unable to properly poop, even with stool softeners and sorbitol, and so nurses are pushing for me to get an enema, which for a 17 year old girl, is the most embarrassing thing I can think of since waking up on the day of surgery to find a catheter had been put in.   Sorry for the rant, just needed to let it out really. :(
All steel is pretty much 98% iron with the most minute amounts of carbon FYI. 2% carbon would be an outrageously hard and brittle steel. Most steel alloy's are compromised of only around 0.35% carbon. An average steel blade is closer to pure iron than a lot of things considered silver are pure silver. This of course is being written purely from a metallurgy/scientific standpoint regardless of the fact whether ghosts are real or not just so you will have your fact straight.
It's not uncommon to marry a non-muslim, heck my neighbors are half Arab half Mexican. It would help if you didn't do too many of the things that aren't in the religion, like gambling, drinking, ect.
We were together six months, she ended it. the breakup wasn't bitter or anything. she wanted to continue being friends. i told her to give it some time. she texted me like 5 times over the next two weeks asking if we can be friends. i wasn't really interested in that but i finally said yes because i do want to remain on at least friendly terms, and I was getting sick of her texting me all the time asking to be friends.   That said, I have no interest in being her emotional support. she has continued to text and snapchat me on occasion and i don't say much and sometimes don't reply cause I just don't feel like it tbh.   today, one of her good friends fb messaged me and said that my ex has been really sad that I don't talk to her as much. i said she ended it, we aren't together anymore, what does she expect? ex's friend says  she knows but (ex) doesn't like that she isn't able to talk to you.
I recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 on my desktop, and I have been pretty happy with the majority of my experience so far. There are a few minor things that bug me, but they are usually overlooked by the number of improvements. However, one thing in particular has been bothersome and that is the power controls, such as putting the computer to sleep, shutting it down, hibernating, or restarting the computer.   I know there are quite a few ways to quickly access these options, such as Win + X to bring up the advanced options menu, Win + I to bring up the settings charm with the Power button along the bottom, or even going into the advanced power options to set the power button to do something specific. However, I believe I have a solution that can make these controls even quicker to access and with the convenience and flexibility of a keyboard this should be rather simple.   I propose the addition of a Power Controls popup window that follows the same design style as the charms, except it is centered on the screen. I created a quick mockup to give visual aid:   The black squares indicates an icon corresponding to its action (for example, "Sleep" could be an arrow that circles around, "Shut down" can be the traditional circle with a vertical line cutting through the top, etc). This new charm should be quickly accessible via a keyboard shortcut. When the charm comes up, the rest of the display will dim to provide focus on the charm.   As for the keyboard shortcut, this can possibly be hard-coded just like all the other charms are, or it can be custom. For me personally, I would probably set it to come up when I press Win + P. As of right now, that shortcut brings up the Project charm, which provides very basic control over what a connected projector displays. Since I am using a desktop, this function is useless to me. I use multiple monitors, but I like to use the Nvidia Control Panel to manage my displays. I would like to have Win + P to be the Power Controls charm. Perhaps this functionality can be expanded by allowing a number to be pressed to activate its corresponding action (For example, using the layout I created, pressing Win + P and then followed by pressing 2 on the number keys would cause the computer to Hibernate). This would allow me to quickly and easily access the various power controls without having to switch between the keyboard and mouse.   Are there any thoughts on this suggestion? I would love to see this implemented or even to hear from a Microsoft developer to know if this is feasible.
If you know who Frank the Barbarian is, stop reading!   A quick one this time! You can read my past rules struggles as a new GM for new group from my other posts, but this one is more general one.   After just finishing Catacombs of Wrath straight after Glassworks, my PCs are tomorrow heading back to town and while I was researching in to Appraise and Spellcraft for "loot evaluation" to come, I learned that appraise is something that should be used lightly for flavor only. From spellcraft I gathered that it should be kept to keep some mystery around (cursed) magic items, untill said item is researched and magic values discovered.   Oh and I'm still on the edge on how to treat weight limits, as we have to look for weight of every item they ever pick up.. But on the other hand one of them picked Dwarf to exactly over come carrying troubles.
So I work as a bank teller and there's this one guy that comes in pretty often. He's tall, kind of cute, and he seems really nice. The last time he was in, we started having a conversation and I could tell he was leading toward asking me out, but my boss was right there so I kind of hinted to him to not ask me right then. One of my banker friends caught him the next time he was in and gave him my number for me. Since I've done his transactions before, I knew his first and last name so I really quick just looked him up on Facebook. I don't always look a guy up on Google or Facebook, but I was just curious because I knew absolutely nothing about him. Honestly I only wanted to see a couple pictures of him, and didn't at all expect what I found.   Turns out we wrote some incredibly weird/offensive statuses. He called people on welfare "bums asking for handouts" and he is against all drinking, smoking, and drug usage (Not just for himself, but he called anyone that drinks an "alcoholic"). I drink socially and smoke pot occasionally. He also wrote this weird rant about the ice bucket challenge, and actually said that he is against donations. Like, ALL donations to anything. Period. He did this "streak" where he worked for 434 days in a row and claims he averaged 17.5 hours a day, and wrote a status thanking everyone that helped him complete his goal like he won an Oscar or something. He got really pissy and rude if anyone asked why he was doing it or said he should take a day off. On one of the statuses about work, someone commented that he should find a "good woman", and he said this: "A good woman? Haven't seen one out there that's actually worthy of me or my time. They're dishonest and have lack of intelligence. I'll make time for the family members who keep it honest, keep it positive, and who make the time for me too. That's respect"   So basically there are just too many red flags there for me, and a couple of my friends think the same. I'm curious as to what you guys think. If you want I can screenshot some of the stuff he wrote. He called me earlier this afternoon and left a voicemail and I haven't returned his call. I honestly just really don't want to go out with him, but I feel really bad because I was the one that gave him my number. What do you think is the best thing to do in this situation?
How about a study on just four verses   Daniel 9: 24-27.   These four verses are one of the most important prophecies in the Old Testament. The prophecy as a whole is presented in verse 24. The first sixty-nine weeks are described in verse 25. The events between the 69th week and the 70th week are detailed in verse 26 and the 70th week is described in verse 27. Daniel's prophecy of the seventy weeks provides the chronological framework for Messianic prediction from Daniel’s time to the establishment of God’s Kingdom on earth and is a crucial key to end times interpretation.   >24: Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, And to anoint the Most Holy.   > Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city   Week comes from the Hebrew “shabuwa” which means seven, a period of seven days or years. In this case it means seventy “sevens” of years or 490 years. The seventy weeks (490 years) are focused upon Daniel's people (the Jews) and his holy city (Jerusalem). These six things are all to be completed in the 70 weeks (490 years).   > to finish the transgression   This means that transgression itself will be finished, an end to man's rebellion against God. This requires the inauguration of the kingdom of God on earth. Look around, this has not happened yet.   > to make an end of sins   This means not only the end of the guilt of sin, but an end of sin itself. This looks to a new, redeemed world. Look around, not there yet.   > to make reconciliation for iniquity   Our Lord Christ Jesus clearly accomplished this at the cross.   > to bring in everlasting righteousness   Remember this is speaking of the Jews and Jerusalem and this means a new order of society brought in by Messiah at His Second Coming.   > to seal up vision and prophecy   This speaks of both the ending and fulfillment of all prophecy, concluding the final stage of human history and culminating with the reign of the Son of God. We know that all prophecy will not be fulfilled until Christ’s return.   > And to anoint the Most Holy.   This means to anoint or to consecrate after its pollution the Most Holy place in the temple which can only have its true realization in Messiah. Only when sin is "made an end of" can God's presence be perfectly manifested.  Messiah will anoint or consecrate with His presence the most holy place at Jerusalem (Jeremiah 3:16-17, Ezekiel 37:27-28), after its pollution by Antichrist, of which the Feast of Dedication after the pollution by Antiochus is a type.   >25: Know therefore and understand, That from the going forth of the command To restore and build Jerusalem Until Messiah the Prince, There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times.   Daniel’s 70 weeks are divided into three parts; 7 weeks (49 years) for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, 62 more weeks (434 years) until the coming of the Messiah with one week (7 years) left. The street and the wall make it clear that the decree had to be to rebuild the city not just the temple. Artaxerxes issued the decree to rebuild Jerusalem (not just the temple) in 445 BC (The Book of Nehemiah 2) this started Daniel’s 70 weeks. 69 weeks (483 years) later was Christ’s Triumphal Entry in 32AD. The rebuilding of Jerusalem would take the first seven weeks (49 years), then after another 62 weeks of years (434 years) Messiah the Prince would come. Jesus scolded the Pharisees and Sadducees (in Matthew 16) for not knowing the time of His coming because they were told in this verse.   > 26: And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; and the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a flood, and till the end of the war desolations are determined.   > And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself   The Messiah was rejected by the Jews and executed (cut off) for the sake of others.   > and the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.   The Roman army made up of the people of the prince who is to come (Antichrist) destroyed Jerusalem and the temple.   > The end of it shall be with a flood, and till the end of the war desolations are determined.   The Roman army destroyed Jerusalem, the temple, and ran over the city like a flood. Christ was crucified, the Roman armies destroyed the temple and the city of Jerusalem and the Jews were dispersed and remained dispersed throughout the world until 1948.   > 27 Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate.   > Then he   The "he" Gabriel mentions is “the prince who is to come” mentioned in the previous verse. This is the Antichrist (or end times ruler or man of sin or man of lawlessness or son of perdition if you prefer). Notice the “THEN” which means after what happened in verse 26, so SOMETIME AFTER Jerusalem and the Temple are destroyed in 70AD “the prince who is to come” shall confirm a covenant with many for one week.   >shall confirm a covenant with many for one week   Here it is folks, Daniel’s 70th week. The Antichrist confirming a peace treaty with Israel will start Daniel’s 70th week. With this covenant Israel will embrace the Antichrist as a political messiah, if not the literal Messiah. Jesus predicted this in John 5:43: “I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.”   >but in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering   But after three and a half years the Antichrist will betray Israel and put an end to Temple sacrifice and offering.   >And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate   Abominations is translated from the Hebrew word “shiqquwts” that is connected to horrific idolatry. The idea is that the Antichrist breaks the covenant and brings an end to sacrifice and offering by desecrating the holy place of the temple with horrific idolatry (he sets up the image of the beast (Satan)). Jesus called this the abomination of desolation (Matthew 24:15) and indicated that it would be the pivotal sign of the start of the Great Tribulation. Paul referred to the idolatry of the Antichrist in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4.   > even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate.   These abominations will continue until the consummation of God's wrath and vengeance, until all God has determined is poured out on this desolate people (earth dwellers) and will continue until the times of the Gentiles is fulfilled. When the 70th week is completed, each of the things described in verse 24 will be accomplished and everlasting righteousness will reign.   From the description of what would be accomplished in the 70 weeks from Daniel 9:24, we know that the 70 weeks are not  yet complete. The events promised in the first 69 weeks are fulfilled indicating there is a lengthy "pause" in between the 69th and 70th week. The 70th week will begin when the coming prince (Antichrist) confirms a covenant with Israel. These "gaps" or  "pauses" in prophecy may seem strange to us, but they are common. Comparing Isaiah 9:6 and Luke 1:31-33 shows another  significant "pause" or "gap" in prophecy regarding the coming of the Messiah. Such a break in prophetic chronology has  precedent in the predictions of Messiah's first and second advents (Isa. 61:1-2). More evidence of a break between the 69th  and 70th week is the fact that there is a 38-year gap, between Messiah's cutting off in 32AD and the destruction of Jerusalem in  70AD. Daniel presented both of these events as after the 69th week and before the 70th week.   When the Jews rejected Messiah, God turned His attention to the Church and away from Israel. This started the “Church age.”  After the church is “gathered together with Him,” God will turn His attention back to the restoration of Israel. Sixty-nine weeks  were finished in the coming of the Messiah, but the Messiah was cut off. At this point God's prophetic clock was stopped for Israel and has remained stopped. There will be an event (the Antichrist making a covenant with Israel) that will signal the  starting of the clock once again, the beginning of the 70th week of Daniel.
Speaking as a college student member.   Emails from subscriptions are good and informative.   The conference in NO can be good, bad, boring, fun.   Panels last year were so-so except for a few. The keynote was really good.   As for competitions, if your chapter is really into it then it's a good time. I was able to compete in the Case Competition last year so presenting it was a great experience (even though we didn't come in 1st or 2nd - Everyone else comes in "3rd" between the 10 finalists - Also I think last year there were around 67 entries).   Winners are pretty standard every year from what I hear, which is fine...gives everyone else something to strive toward. It's really interesting when you end up running into a friend from high school from a no name college and they're there lol.   Networking is great, met a lot of awesome peers in the field. Again, this can range from people who are passionate about marketing to "hey new orleans".   The conference got paid for by my school...so in another sense it was a free trip to New Orleans. If you haven't been there before, it's fantastic for anyone. I'm a fan of swing, jazz, spicy food, and art...so the place was a blast. Also went out a lot to the bars as any college student would.
My recent past: Just got out of a 2 year relationship in which I was completely happy with someone for the most part but we broke up due to issues with our sex life, our beliefs, and other minor details.   Current situation: 5 months single and in my 4th year of college. I have 3 semesters to go (double major) and then I'd like to move to a different state. I spend a lot of my time with school/internships/clubs and my social life is extremely limited.   Moving forward: I'd like a girl with the same libido, is relatively attractive, has a similar level of education, we enjoy our time together (usual stuff), we have similar views (religion, politics, etc), and does not watch reality TV (a stretch im sure).
Let's talk about atoms. Atoms are just fucking awesome. Let's spouse you re an atom and you ask yourself, what's my again again? The answer will be, depends where are you watching yourself from and if you are watching yourself. An atom can be at two places at the same time, the particles of the atoms are work like materials and like waves at the same time. So probably you should answer these questions before ask that one.
See [my response to the other guy]( for a further explanation of terms as commonly understood in economics.   There is a very commonly used and widely understood term in economics for the North Carolina sales tax proposal: [regressive](  It is not flat, which is something else.  And since "progressive" has its own meaning, rather than saying "more progressive", saying "more equitable" or "fairer" muddles meanings less.   (
So a few years back I signed up to an office temps employment agency within the UK while I had a casual job. They were constantly ringing me while I was in a period of solid work for about two weeks so was forced by one of there staff members to unregister myself so never found out how it worked or how quickly they could actually get me a job.   I now need a job to get me through summer as I move back home from university and my parents are demanding rent plus with the course I do, if I want to get any work done outside the hours lecture labs opening times Ill need to buy the software.   How easy is it to get a job with these such services and what are your experiences working with them? I have chosen to go this way as most jobs they were advertising when I walked past there shop windows were around £9-12 p/h.
Nothing, it's already perfect. Just because an item is not used regularly in the pro scene doesn't mean it's a bad item. Same with Halberd, Atos and EBlade.   The pro scene goes through trends. back then, every carry would buy a vanguard and/or linkens. While Skadi was a staple for ranged carries with no disables.   Easiest reason why pros don't pick this item up is that they know how to work together with the team. The carry doesn't need a slow disable when your team can disable the enemy for you. This is a different matter when your team has almost zero disables or that your supports just don't know how to use their spells in conjunction with yours.   And that's the trend nowadays, No more chinese doto where 1 carry gets farmed to all hell and just takeover the game. A team that works well together in a fight will trump any carry.   An example would be Shadow Fiend. Skadi was a core for him, because he has pitiful stats and needs a disable. Now pros don't touch the item, because there's no need for Shadow Fiend to disable the enemy when you have a Magnus RP. Now it's a whole different matter when the team has zero disables, in which SF will most probably get this item.   Edit (taken from my previous comment):There's a reason why it's so expensive. Imagine if EBlade didn't give agility and hence is relatively cheap, only retaining it's active. It would be hazardous and volatile since every one will be able to buy it and hence the balance of the game will be messed up. It goes the same with Skadi. Imagine it without the stats, only a very powerful slow for your attacks. It will then be relatively cheap and hence every one will be running around with it.   The stats act as a recipe, an excuse for it to be expensive.
It has been a long wait, but the global release of Dark Souls 3 is finally upon us :) We would like to take this opportunity to remind you again of our spoiler policy, and to clarify that we will be continuing to enforce this policy for the first few weeks of the game.   Please also [read our community rules and guidelines](   As a reasonable percentage of sub members have already played the game, we ask all users to be considerate, and not spoil any story-related aspect of the game for anyone else. While we realise many of you have already spent a few weeks getting to know the game, lots of players are just starting out. It is always a difficult task to balance when a new game is released, as many players are understandably enthusiastic about sharing their experiences and new found items or areas. The best way we've found to manage this for everyone involved is to implement these rules:     If your post contains spoilers, please tag it appropriately (we use NSFW tags on this subreddit to indicate spoilers, and text phrases can also be obscured with the spoiler instructions in the sidebar).   Spoilers are story-related names, events or locations . This includes Boss names, area names, item names, weapon names and covenant names if they are story related.  General game mechanics and features will no longer be considered spoilers . For example, discussion about upgrade paths, or mechanics such as poise, backstabs, parrying, etc. are all fine. But, locations of upgrade materials or covenant reveals are still considered spoilers if their name or description relates to a specific story point.  When in doubt, tag it as a spoiler and refrain from putting the info in your title out of respect for your fellow sub members .   As well, you must include the word 'Spoiler' in the post title if your post text contains spoilers - this allows our automod settings to take care of tagging it for you if you've accidentally forgotten to apply the NSFW tag.   If you don't wish to view any spoiler posts, use the 'Hide Spoilers' filter in the sidebar.   Spoilers in the post title itself will result in a warning, and the post being removed. Violations of this rule may result in a ban.
Where do i start... I was on a holiday to visit my cousin in Juli month this year, and since he lives with his girlfriend, i did not want to be a pestilence and force them to take me in for a whole week. So i went to my Aunts house (Which is 5 minutes walk from my cousins place, my aunt and her husband went on a 3 week holiday trip the next day so i had the crib for my self.)   Before i continue, i just need to point out that they have a 1 year old daughter, and they've been married for 2 years, and my aunts husband is from her birthtown, he came to our country 3 years ago, and he's without a job and hasn't learned our language at all.   The husband has his own personal desktop PC in the living room, which i of course powered on to check some stuff. Luckily he didn't have a password on it.  I'm a YouTube guy, and we all misspell sometimes. So instead of pressing Y, i pressed T.  Now, what starts with a T that might be a little weird? Tran-sexual.  There were tons of history based on Transsexual, Gay, Gay live cam etc.  So now i'm stuck with the knowledge of my Aunt being married to a guy that might do crazy stuff behind her back.   Might need to keep this secret to myself.
I'm not going to post my team number, just in case the mentor lurks on here too. But anyways, we have this mentor who has been with us for a couple years. Recently he has become more and more controlling and manipulative. Last season, our team decided on a design for a shooter only robot. However, this mentor disagreed, but we paid no attention to him because everyone else wanted a shooting robot. I, as the programmer, have no idea how, but he managed to manipulate students and come in after the students had left to change the design to the way he wanted. Essentially, he redesigned the robot the he wanted without asking. The design didn't work and we knew from the beginning, but he wouldn't listen to the programming team. The design ended up failing on week 3. So on week 3, we changed design and went with a robot that shot. We didn't finish and as a result, did poorly at regionals. This isn't the only case of his manipulation. He also refused to let us take apart the robot because he says its 'his robot'. We have tried talking to him multiple times, but he doesn't listen.  How do we deal with this?
You need a bachelors in science to get into PT. So study hard and earn your BS in biology (you'll need a 3.8+). Try to get a job at a therapy or rehab clinic as a tech or something, because having a job there and getting letters of recommendation from the therapists will be worth more than doing the minimum 40 something volunteer hours required for your application.   Also, try to get letters of recommendation from your favorite professor in a science course (anatomy, physiology, microbiology, health studies). Stop by the professors office during office hours and get clarity on any questions or a paper you're working on. Basally rub elbows with your profs, because familiarity does breed attraction, and if they can put a face and work ethic to a name, they will write very good letters.
Back in college, was tired of seeing the kitchen a mess, so one roomate and I cleaned it spotless. Standing in the doorway, looking into the kitchen, it appeared that no one lived in the house. SPOT-LESS. No fridge magnets, no dishrags. Even the dish soap was under the sink. Congratulating ourselves to a job well done, we went into the living room to play need for speed. While we're playing, we hear the distinct sound of a fork hitting the floor in the kitchen. We go to find it in the middle of the floor. We were flabergasted. Where did it come from? It was NOT on the counter or in the sink or the top of the fridge (cleaned there too). Did it jump out of the drawer?
I've been with my current bf (27 m) for almost 4 years. As soon as I meet someone else who's new, interesting & exciting I doubt my current relationship, even though I know we're super compatible, I'm attracted to him physically, and can see us having a long happy life together. It's caused a lot of stress, and I've ended things about 6 times over the last 9 months, and I manage to convince him to get back together by communicating my solutions, feelings and awareness of my issues and how I plan on fixing them.   I grew up with really strict parents, who were really cold and never expressed affection or communicated any sort of loving words towards me. They have a really cold, unloving marriage themselves. I felt like I didn't have much control over what I could do, up until the time I moved out on my own at 17 for school. During that time I met my current bf, and things were great. I moved back home 1.5 years into our relationship to save money, and I wonder if being around my cold parents again has affected my relationship.   My bf thinks it does. But I'm not sure.
40, M, 198 lbs, 5'11"   Conclusion : looks like 'runhomequick' was right and I had inadequate ketones in my diet. Adding coconut oil helped a lot, feeling much better this week.   I've been doing the slow carb diet for about 8 months now. I've had some success but plenty (tons) of plateaus and some failures in that time. My best weeks I would lose 3 pounds. Lowest weight I ever got to was 189.5. I was typically around 194. I went off the reservation a few times and gained it back. Many weeks in there I'd be strict with the diet, get exercise and see zero change at the end of the week.   My initial goal was to go from 20% BF to 15% BF. After 8 months of messing with it, I think I need to give up on that idea. Last week I lost 3.5 pounds. This week I gained 2 pounds. WTF.   The biggest hurdle seems to be this feeling of  'brain fog' AKA low carb flu :  That's totally how I'm feeling... brain is starved for glycogen and I have a hard time handling complex topics and concentrating. I do feel slightly better after cardio (1 hour of running and walking).   I've heard several possible culprits for this:     inadequate protein   excess caffeine   lack of water   lack of fat   lack of sleep    too many snacks   lack of vitamins   blood chemistry issue     Inadequate protein: No way. I start every day with 40g of protein in a shake, then have breakfast that consists of 2 eggs, pintos/lentils, brocolli or spinach and a pork chop or some chicken breast. By my math I'm getting at least 60g protein in the first 2 hours of the day.   Excess caffeine: well I tested this by switching completely to decaf coffee. Still some caffeine in there sure. Over the past month I've had the equivalent of 1 16 oz cup of coffee per  week . No change to the brain fog.   Lack of water: I don't get this one. I'm never thirsty. I'm drinking about 64-80 fl oz of coffee/tea/water/diet soda per day (1 can of diet ginger ale per day). Anymore and I feel like I have to hit the bathroom every 20 mins. It gets annoying to go to the bathroom that much. There is such a thing as 'enough' hydration.   Lack of fat: tough one to assess. I usually have 1 tbsp of olive oil or 1/4 avocado with every meal. I guess this could not be enough.   Lack of sleep: heard somewhere that I should be sleeping 9 hours for max fat burn. Right. I usually wake up at the 7-8 hr mark without my alarm. I have to be exhausted or using narcotics (nyquil) to sleep 9 hours.   Too many snacks: when this brain fog hits me I need to do something, so I usually will eat some meat or have some peanut butter. Doesn't seem to help.   Vitamins: this is too nebulous for me to do anything with. Maybe if someone could point to a specific vitamin? I usually take Vit D, Cal/Mag/Zinc and a multivitamin once a day. I've tried taking B vitamins as well with no effect.   Blood chemistry issue: seems reasonable, but I had my Dr. check my blood chemistry and it was fine. The only thing that was even slightly out of normal was elevated creatinine (from muscle building).   So I'm stumped.  Can't lose weight reliably on this SCD. Should I try something else? Keto? Primal?
I find myself repeatedly clearing .opera/typed_history.xml because it becomes full of irrelevancies.   Example being I type in reddit.com/r/op and Opera auto suggests -era, when in fact I visit reddit.com/r/operabrowser far more frequently, but I once typed reddit.com/r/opera in error. [EDIT: Looks like reddit (or maybe RES) is autolinking, this is unintentional]   Does anyone else get frustrated by this, and if so what solutions have you found? The best outcome would be to autocomplete the most  frequently  visited address, like pretty much all other browsers   Somewhat irrelevant, but does anyone know what logic it uses to autocomplete? I thought alphabetically, but no, or chronologically but not that either
My parents split when I was 15, 23 now.   At first it sucked alot, but I soon realised that it was for the best; there were no arguments to sit through anymore. My dad was alot happier and followed his dream of travelling the world, which I'm still jealous about. Now I get to be friends with both parents, and I get two birthday meals, two christmas meals, two lots of everything so that's pretty cool.
I'm going away to college and my boyfriend (a senior in high school) is nervous about being in a LDR.   Now, it'd be fine if we had all summer together; however, his parents are divorced and he spends the whole summer up north (12 hour drive, 2 hour flight). I don't even think he'll be back in time to help me move in to college :(   I told him I could come down almost every weekend (my college is a 3 hour drive away) and that he could maybe come up and visit and spend the weekend in a mutual friends dorm (if his mom would allow it. We have yet to discuss this with her).   Also, he's worried about what will happen when HE goes off to college. He wants to go to Princeton or Colombia. The college in our state is his fall back college. I told him I would gladly transfer to his dream school (because Im not really excited about the place I got accepted into and I'd be willing to follow him. My parents are on board with this as well)
My parents had a similarly odd story. My mom owned a bar and my dad had become a semi regular customer. Mom had the hots for him and realized they had a mutual friend, Bob. Mom tells Bob she wants to get it on with dad. Bob buys dad a drink and starts talking about how great in bed mom supposedly is, but how hard it is to get her there. Drunk dad bets Bob $20 he'll get mom into bed. They had a two night stand on a boat a week later.
Original Post HERE:   * Sorry this is so long. A fair bit happened. The juicy summary is at the bottom. Also, I'm feeling a bit angry at my grandma atm, so it may come across in my post, but please remember I do love her very much.   So, I told my mom about two weeks ago that I do not want anyone staying over at the house for at least a month after I give birth. I told her that my boyfriend will be taking a month off work to stay at home with me, so I won't be needing any help. His being there would also mean that they would be intruding on special bonding time between us as a family. I think she was disappointed, but understood. I left it up to her to let my grandma know, as I was in no mood for the guilt tripping I expected her to do. I told her that they were of course still welcome to visit me in the hospital after I'd given birth, and were still welcome to (after the first week) come by for short visits during the day. But as for staying in the spare bedroom, or for any extended period of time, that was a no go.   Last week I was talking to my mom (my mom and I are quite close by the way, it is rare I go more than a day or two without talking to her on the phone. We both work in office's by ourselves, so we have a fair amount of time and ability to chat while we are working). At that point she had still yet to tell my grandma what I said. Buuuut, some things had changed in what my grandma's plans for her visit was. Originally the plan was for her to move down permenantly this summer, which changed last minute to her coming to visit for a few weeks. According to her, it was too stressful to move at this time. NOW because she's not moving here, she was thinking that she would  stay for a couple months. I mentioned in my last post that she does not have a large amount of income coming in, so when she comes and visits, whoever she stays with covers all associated living costs and meals. Which, in a two or three week stay isn't a big deal. In fact, I think it's fairly normal for family to cover those expenses for visiting family for a week or two. But when you start getting into months, it can end up costing a fair bit. I'd also like to mention that my grandma in the past has treated these visits like vacation. Meaning she does zero cooking, zero cleaning, and needs to be constantly entertained. Essentially having my grandma come to visit is like having an additional child. One that is old, pouty and that I can't discipline.   I feel it really important to make it very clear, this is not my grandma's fault. It's hard to explain to outside people, but there are some mental issues that my grandma has that cause her to act this way. She doesn't have the maturity of a typical adult. She has epilepsy (though she hasn't had a seizure in years), she suffers from general anxiety disorder, and she has been displaying some of the preliminary's of dementia.  I love my grandma very much, and I try to help as best as I can with making sure she feels loved and wanted when she comes down.   This is where we get into the tricky business. My mom was trying to plan around this now two month long visit. My grandma's idea was if she extended her visit, she could stay by herself for a few weeks at our house. I have officially said NO to coming down immediately after the birth, but if she extends her stay then she would be visiting a month or so after the baby is born. I am going to have a four year old and a new baby at home. I am going to be taking my daughter back and forth to pre K, and trying to get into a steady routine with my new daughter. Quite frankly, I don't think I will have the patience required to deal with my grandmother. On top of that, as mentioned before, my grandma is a Jehova Witness. My boyfriend and I, while living together and having a child together, are not married. We may never get married. We've never even discussed getting married, and honestly it's just not something that either of us feels particularly strong about. It's not off the table, but if it ever did happen, it won't be until we are in a financial position to afford a wedding that was perfect for us.   My grandma believes strongly that if you aren't married you can't share a bed. She told my mom that she wants to stay with us, but morally can't if my boyfriend and I share a bed.   Now. I didn't want grandma coming to stay with me at all this year. It isn't a good time for us. We just moved into the house. We will have just had a new baby. We are adjusting to our new lives and having someone come visit for weeks just doesn't work. But moreso, I am not willing to compromise on the sleeping arrangements. Our house is both my boyfriend's and mine. We are together, and we are a couple. We will act as a couple and we will share the same bed like we always do. This is not something I feel I should have to compromise on for a week just so grandma can pretend like we aren't diddling eachother. I mean for realz. I'm only freaking eight months pregnant. I think it's a little late for the no sex before marriage crap.   Anyway. I told my mom that we were not willing to change sleeping arrangements because of xyz. She said she understood, but I think she was hoping I'd try to make an allowance for it. Partially because she doesn't want grandma to stay at her house for an entire two months with no break.   So. I am talking to my mom today. And she tells me that it sounds like grandma has decided not to come at all now. I guess my mom told her my position on what would happen if she came down while I am expecting/after I give birth. I wasn't aware of this, but I guess earlier this year, when my great grandma passed away, my grandma was left a bit of money. Not a terribly large amount, but somewhere in the fifteen to twenty grand mark. My mom is in the middle of building a house, and my brother recently graduated and she has been helping him out as well. So she asked my grandma if she would pay for the $600.00 ticket. She basically told my mom that was way too much money, and that she was trying to pre-pay for her own funeral atm. Which, since she was up until less than a month ago planning on moving here, is a little hard to believe. Either that, or she never had any intention of moving to begin with. Anyway. I guess the problem solved itself in the end. But the whole thing is so frustrating to me.   On one hand, I'm glad she won't be staying WITH us. It's a relief that I won't have to deal with that while I'm going through so much in my life. But I'm a little hurt that her reaction is, 'Fine then, I won't come there at all.'. We were hoping that she would delay her trip, not decide to cancel entirely. On the other, I'm angry that she decided not to move here. Last I heard it had been a delayed thing, but if she's making her own funeral arrangements then it's obvious her plan is to die there. My mom and I are the only family she has who will look after her  when  (and it really is a matter of when) she becomes unable to care for herself anymore. Instead of moving here, where we can visit her regularly and ensure she's being properly cared for, she's going to be a huge financial burden, because we will have to find a home for her in Kingston, and will have to fly to visit her. This means we will visit her far less. I was excited to be able to visit her on a regular basis, and now, my children will never have a real relationship with her. And whenever she does visit, she will guilt us all about how 'woe is her, her great grandchildren don't recognize her and make strange'. But I just have to keep reminding myself that she is an adult, and it is her decision to make.
Over the last two years my fiancee and I have taken turns switching jobs, each for a raise that put us up over the other's pay. She started the relationship making significantly more than I did, and when she completes the temp part of her temp-to-hire current gig, the concomitant raise will put her back up over me. And I'm fine with this.   Before she and I got together, she was a single mother who bought her own house. At first she had a roommate on the mortgage, but she ended up buying him out when his new girl was... not conducive to a good home environment. She paid the mortgage on her own for at least another year, maybe two, before she and I got together. During all that time, she never had more than a six-month relationship because, in large part, she was more stable and successful than the guys who asked her out, and it inevitably drove them off.   I watched this happen, while stuck in my own failing relationship, and about a year after that finally ended, we got together - because, in addition to many other things, I am not (frequently) stupid. I'm not financially stable, and I know it. I have a good job now, more or less by luck and brass, but it isn't stable either. When we got together, I was waiting tables and missing bills left and right. She has owned a house for years, paid off her own car, and held down a good job for most of her son's life, switching to a new job only under great duress - and even then, to a better job with a significant raise. We have a solid arrangement - she gets (a little less than, since the recent raise) half my check, for bills, and the rest of my check (and, since her raise, more than a little of hers) is our discretionary income. She makes sure the bills get paid, I make sure we eat. It works out much, much better than I would have anticipated my life going, even as little as five years ago. Of course this isn't the only reason we're together, but it's a good one.
I'm a female.   When I was 6, I was running home from school to my babysitter's as I always did.  I LOVED to run.  I'm on a suburban street with not a soul around.  All of the sudden I hear, "Hey, little girl, HEY!"  I stop, look around and see a guy in a carport across the street.  He pulls down his pants and yells, "Get over here, NOW!"  I froze, panicked, trying to comprehend just what in the fuck?!?   He yells at me again, "Come here, NOW!!"  I know all about stranger danger and this shit is no bueno!  I start taking off running for my life.  I'm not screaming as there is no one around, everyone is at work.  I don't even look behind me as I'm scared he's running after me.  My little 6 year old mind is freaking the fuck out with the most incredible fear of my life.   I get to my sitters and I'm embarrassed.  I won't talk and the sitter thinks it's odd as I'm usually a chatty cathy.  Finally her daughter (and my best friend) comes home from her school and I tell her what happened.  She manages to finally talk me into telling her mom.  Cops came, had to drive around forever with me in the front seat as my wee mind and memory tries to remember which house it was.  The cop was so patient.  Finally, I figure out which house it is.  The cops make all of them come out and I point out which guy it was and he's arrested.   9 years later he was charged and convicted of raping a young girl.
I was a Closing manager at Taco Bell and we were short Managers because 2 were out for a death in the family, My GM was on vacation states away. which was fine the other 3 of us were going to do the open mid day and close no problem, however Opening Manager calls out sick asks me if i could open (no problem it was 5 am when i got out and we start at 7) open the store around 2 when the midday is supposed to show no luck 4 rolls around still no show and i'd been blowing his phone up. around 8 i get a call saying nah man i quit just got a job working construction with my brother. Fuck, now i have to basicly open and close after closing the night before no problem. Next day im opening because Opening manager is in hospital, so i call my GM and tell him whats going on he just says oh you will be fine to which i reply im working like 21 hours a day now with 3 for sleep this goes on for 4 days and on that day during lunch rush I'm already sleep deprived and agitated i get called to the window because a lady in drive through has a complaint I check it out she says she ordered a diet mountain dew and got a regular so i apologize and am about to close the window get a new drink and she throws her drink at me and calls me a pathetic looser at which point i flip shit and go off on her not giving a fuck after i curse her out i take all the premade drinks we had setup and chuck them at her tell her to get fucked, the she looked so shocked and sped off and  i stormed out...as my employees are cheering me on i got in my car sped off and pulled over at a 711 and smoked a whole pack of cigaretts called my GM and told hiim because he didnt get a manager from another store to help out with the load and how i snapped and i quit. phone kept blowing up the next 2 days never answered it finally checked my voicemail and it was My GM telling me the lady came up and apologized for how she acted and was not upset with me and he was sorry for putting the load on me asked me to come back to work... I just sent him a text saying thats nice no thanks i dont need that.    Why do people treat Fast Food employees so shitty...like our job already isnt shitty enough.
I've been at an airline for the better part of three years now and there are definitely a few great things to keep in mind any time you take a commercial flight.   Starting from the minute you get into the airport: Customer Service Agents are the first people that can make or break your trip. Yelling, screaming, getting crabby, lewd, patronizing, only makes your trip worse and worse. You see, when you think you're making a point or a difference in these peoples' lives, you're totally wrong. They retreat to the break room and laugh about it with their coworkers. And they probably didn't go out of their way to get you a better seat. Golden rule: Be nice. Simple. Smile, joke around, keep a positive disposition - this seems impossible when shit's hitting the fan in the case of cancellations/delays, but believe me, those agents didn't want those things to happen either. They can and will work their magic IF you give them the opportunity to. There are ways to get you a window or aisle seat even if there are only middle seats showing... believe me. A coffee goes a VERY long way at the gate as well if you're traveling with an airline that's known to upgrade....   Once you're on board, those flight attendants are not only gorgeous, funny and smart, they're also highly-trained professionals that can and will put their own lives at risk for a perfect stranger should the situation arise. Not many people appreciate that fact. So again, be nice. Someone else on this post also noted one of the trade secrets - chocolates. I flew with an airline transatlantic in August, in economy. I approached the lead flight attendant (the one that greets you as your board) and introduced myself and thanked them for having me on board, exchanged pleasantries and handed him a mini-4 pack of maple syrup (can you guess which country I was leaving from?) Sat down for about 5 minutes in my coach seat before he came by and said he was sorry, but "my seat assignment was unfortunately changed." I spent the next 7 hours in a lay-flat bed with all the Grey Goose I could handle. Now, this granted was a standby flight, but regular travelers can also get this treatment, I've seen it!   In the flight deck - this place is just hilarious. I've flown in the jump-seat on a handful of occasions, and I never pass up the opportunity. Between the gadgets, knobs, dials, and especially the view, this is the one place that would cure every nervous flier. Everything that goes into making a plane and keeping it in the air is mind-boggling, and the two pilots up front know EXACTLY what they're doing. It's like a work of art seeing them bring this thing up and down. But that's where it ends. Under 10 000 feet is where the magic happens. Above 10 000 feet, its a lot of banter involving ex-wives, summer houses, bill payments, and catching up on 2-3 day old newspapers that have probably been read 9 or 10 times. One time the sun was shining into my eyes in the jumpseat, and they took out their stack of safety cards and covered the entire windshield, kicked their feet up and enjoyed the ride. When I jokingly blurted out "you can't see the road!!" they pointed to the instruments and just said "it's right there." As the old airline adage goes, what separates perverts from alcoholics? The cockpit door.   Hope this helps!   EDIT:
I'll start. My roommate was one of my friends in high school. We weren't that close, but I figured it would be better to be living with her than a random stranger.   A week before we move in, she gets a boyfriend. I was really happy for her. And then we moved in. He slept over every single night the first week we were there. I was too awkward to say anything, but luckily it calmed down to once a week.   She's also a violin performance major. Which means practicing in our room all the time. I play the violin as well, so I figured it wouldn't be a problem. I quickly developed a resentment towards the violin and classical music.   She also sleeps a fuck ton. Like during the day. Which means I have to be really quiet while she's missing the classes she's paying for. I know it's none of my business, but it pisses me off.   Back to the boyfriend issue. We've been here for about 3 months now and they're together all the time. It wouldn't bother me, except for they hang out in our room. Kissing, giggling, being obnoxious in general. Every single night this week, they've been in here. Even when tonight was supposed to be my night to spend in my room with my own boyfriend.   Her boyfriend has also been sleeping over without permission lately. He slept over when I had a guest in my room. Very uncomfortable. He slept here on Monday, which I allowed because I was staying over at my boyfriend's room. I was out late Tuesday, so he assumed that I wasn't going to be back, and they both slept on the floor. He also slept over last night after we watched a late night movie.   I've been so overwhelmed this past week with them constantly being around me, that I almost cried a few times.   Oh, and the last thing. She uses things of mine without permission. Once, she borrowed my towel to shower because hers was dirty. And she lent my vacuum to her boyfriend. She takes up most of the room in my refrigerator. She uses my tv and xbox whenever she wants. She uses my body pillow to sit on the floor.
Okay.... -takes a calmng breath- I would have tossed all the expired shit, no fucks given. Like it or not, that can make them sick, if not outright kill.   Good on you to go off on her. I can barely imagine you being bitched about your weight for so long, but I believe it wholeheartedly. I forget weight complaints are not just for the disgustingly obese like me sometimes. People can all go eat a bag of infected dicks and die.   Your dad, again, WTF. -sigh- Rock me Amadeus.   Rental management is a bunch of fucktards, no surprises there. Don't call. get some sleep, yo.   As for me, I'm fucking dejected. I hate crashing. Last night, we were doing 7tg Sea- and I made my debut. It was awesome. For context, the group are all foreigners of Vodacce (Italy) and I'm the boss' daughter. After a hilarious mishap, I ended up taking over. They were not happy. but it went well- I even dressed up.   Today, though, fuck me. I didn't get my call back from the tea shop. I went and found out why- and am fucking embarassed, devastated and stupid as all fuck. My currebnt availability is everything but Tuesday night. They were looking for Tuesday night. Here's what kills me:  I forgot to add the words 'flexible availability' to my resume.  I could easily have moved it. Fuck me. They already hired by now. I feel so stupid.   Speaking of work, I had a morning shift.. annddd our DM ninja pops up. FUCK ME. Run around emergency cleaning. Put away racks upon racks of clothes. Get screamed at all day. Run around doing size runs for an hour. Barely get my break. I'm done. I met a girl friend post-work, we spent a bit of time together. We worked together, but I've seen her once since she quit.   Then i had to see my mother. FUCK ME SIDEWAYs. She's still a cunt. Still bitches about my weight, despite the fact my sister is 2/3 my weight now, and only 15. she still destroys me. I can't hande her, but mail still goes there. Fucking hell. I finally left at 6:30 (I went there for 4) and came home. Then bawled my eyes out.
It does come across as informal to me, unless you are hoping to make a very laid back impression on your boyfriend's family. Which isn't bad. I would wear something a little bit dressier but still comfortable-  unless your invitation asks for formal attire, you are going for the right look. The length is good, I would be wary of any shorter if you want to wear something with a heel like most espadrilles have. I also second anyone who says not to wear white. Unless you were asked to, wearing white to a wedding is distasteful.
He was given hardly any opportunities last season and the ones he did have were mainly substitute appearances where it was hard to get into the flow of the game. I went to watch the Arsenal v Bolton league cup game at the emirates in October when Park started and scored a lovely goal. His all round performance that night was class, his movement particularly impressed me and despite not standing out in his substitute appearances, he's definitely shown glimpses of how good he could be for Arsenal if given a good run of games. He has a great record for his country and although the opposition isn't always the best, the goals he's scored for Korea have been very good technically. I've been ball boying for the olympic football matches and I was there last night and I thought Park had a great game. He scored a great goal (the one posted on here earlier) his finishing has always proved to be excellent. He also set up the second goal last night which was tribute to his link up play was brilliant all night.
I suppose I will ask here, since I planned on playing on Project1999.   I played EQ for the first time yesterday. Made an Iksar Necromancer since those were good, but I couldn't find my way around the starting town, let alone find the necromancer guild master. I also had to get used to the controls and camera modes but decided to stick with the first person view since the other camera modes seem kinda weird.   Anyway, having found no success with the Iksar town I made a human necromancer in Freeport. Another player  messaged me and gave me some free stuff, but died while trying to handle the inventory (almost all my slots were full of scrolls and letters so I died while trying to rearrange my inventory to make space for the stuff).   After that, I decided to find the necromancer guild master, Opal Blackbriar. Sadly I had no clues whatsoever, so I decided to hit the wiki which said the guild master is in a basement under the Inn. I went there but couldn't find the secret entrance and googling didn't give me any more information. Maybe you can give me a hint? Please?   I'm also fairly intimidated by the scope of the game. I don't know anything really and I'm worried I can't keep up if I haven't played EQ back in the day. Maybe there's a guide for someone completely new to the game? I checked the "Getting started/returning" link on the right but that one mostly describes the classes and I feel the wiki can't help me that much if I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Any help would be really appreciated.
OK.  This might be long. Parents have been married for almost 40 years, as the title says.  I would say they are pretty complacent about their marriage, and it has been this way for a long time.  Dad has pretty severe hearing loss from less than ideal ear protection while he was an Air Force pilot in the 80's and 90's.  It took him a long time before he was able to admit that his hearing was terrible and sought medical help.  He has a hearing aid in one ear (one ear is not hearing aid-able), and seems like he's been using it consistently for a while now, which is good.  However, his hearing issues contributed to a lot of frustration in my mom and my siblings and I for a LONG time.  I can't help but think much of the strain on my parents' relationship stems from this.  I'm sure they had other issues (poor communication, quick tempers, etc) also, which I wasn't as aware of growing up.   They get along generally, but they are both quick to anger with each other.  To me, I feel that they are both irrational at times, and for a long time I've thought they shouldn't be married anymore.  I'm not aware that they have ever attended individual or couples' therapy, and by now I'm sure it's way too late to have any benefit even if they were to go. However, my dad has a good retirement from the military and is also employed full-time in a good job. My mom definitely couldn't continue her lifestyle if they were to split up, even if she did receive alimony payments.  She has not been working for about... 3 or 4 years now?  I'm not exactly sure.  She quit her teaching job, telling us she was taking a semester off, but after that semester off, she never returned to work.  Sometimes I wonder if she actually quit or it she was let go, and was too embarrassed to tell anyone.   Just to give you an example of how their relationship appears to me, a few months ago, my dad had shoveled the driveway after a big snow.  I thought I was living on another planet when I actually heard the words "thank you" come out of my mom's mouth.  I literally have not heard her say this to him in.. I don't even know how long.   Anyway, I recently moved back to the state my family lives in, after living away for about 10 years.  My brothers all live in the same city we grew up in, as do my parents.  I've only been back (living about an hour away) for about 8 months, but have obviously been able to spend more time with my family since I'm much closer now.  I stay at their place about one weekend a month on average; I hang out with the parents or my brothers and their SO's, and it's nice.  Now that I'm much closer though, I'm beginning to think a few things are strange with how my mom is acting.   Parents have been doing really well with their fitness/health for the past 18-24 months, especially my mom.  She has always been very pretty, and now that she is in very good shape, I think she's more confident and kind of likes extra attention she might receive from others.  This is not inherently bad... but I have this odd feeling that she is doing things on the sly (possibly just "friend" type things?  I can't imagine her having an affair, but sometimes I wonder with her behavior of late).   Here are some examples of the odd things I've noticed:     Sometimes when her cell phone rings, she will answer and walk into a room and close the door (like I remember doing as a teenager)     She keeps posting selfies on fb and other social media, constantly. Again, like a teenager.     I was at their house the other day, and kept hearing some kind of notification sound coming from the computer... I went into the office and looked to see what it was, and it was a facebook call from some random guy with a foreign-sounding name (we're in the US).  Obviously, she wasn't there to answer it, and the call notifications stopped, and then several text/chat messages popped up saying "where are you?" "my DARLING" etc.  I didn't touch anything, but it appeared that there were previous message in this "conversation" based on the size of the scroll bar.     Going to concerts and performances alone.  I'm not sure I believe that she is always alone when she does this... or maybe I'm being hyper-suspicious.     She was late to our Super Bowl party because she was with a "friend" and "had" to take him to the ER for a kidney stone.  I'm a healthcare professional, so she was texting me with questions about it, and telling me she would be late because of this.  Later she mentioned that it was a male friend, which I thought was odd.  She refers to her female friends by name generally.     Along those same lines, she sends occasional text messages to me asking questions about certain medications, saying her "friend" is taking them.     Currently obsessed with her appearance and wants multiple plastic surgery procedures.  I am not opposed to her getting work done at all, but the fervor with which she talks about it, along with the timing, strikes me as kind of odd.     I am 95% sure she does not sleep in the same room as my dad anymore. I know he snores, so maybe that's why.  It's not even my business where are how they sleep, but I find it a little odd, when I think about all the other stuff.     Blares youtube playlists of music videos on the living room TV, no matter who is over.  Stuff like Tswift, Bieber, Ed Sheeran, other pop-y stuff from teenage artists I don't even know about...  This is weird because I've never known her to be into pop music, and it's also annoying to not be able to have a conversation because of how LOUD the music is. I constantly have to find the remote and decrease the volume.  This is more of an annoyance to me (and others) I suppose, but also a noticeable change from her "normal" activity. Again, I feel like she's acting like an obnoxious teenager.     A couple weeks ago, I was leaving their house to head back to my place, and realized I had left my toiletry bag after driving for about 2 minutes.  I turned around to go get it, and when I went to the bathroom where I had left my stuff, I could hear my mom having a loud phone conversation with a man (she had her phone on speaker) from behind the closed door.  I was going to go in there and say "haha, I'm leaving for real this time," but since I heard she was on the phone, I just walked out of the house and left.  It seemed like she was almost waiting for me to leave so she could call this friend and talk without seeming rude to me.     This.  This is the occurrence that led me to post this today: Brother and dad ran into her this morning at a bowling alley, when she had told my dad she was going to church. (I think she's the only one of us who goes to church at all anymore).  She apparently was there with a bunch of older men, and my brother didn't seem to think she was acting like she really knew them.  It was odd because my brother and dad (and sometimes me) go bowling almost every sunday morning, and she decided to go by herself and not with them, while saying she was going somewhere else.  I guess she acted pretty nonchalant like this wasn't strange or odd in any way. I even talked to her on the phone last night and asked her if she was going bowling in the morning, and she said something like, "no, I'm going to a performance at noon or 1." So weird.       So, I'm an adult, my parents are adults, my brothers are all adults.  My brothers and I just think there is something a little fishy, a little "off"... Should I bring it up with her?  I don't want to assume something is going on if she's just doing her own thing and I also don't want her to close off/shut down if she thinks we're judging her or anything.   I hope this made sense, I'm trying to gather all the thoughts I've been having about this over the last several months.
I can certainly expand: it's not true. That is to say: the site Schliemann dug through is certainly Troy, but it's not true that everyone before him agreed that it was a fictional place. Schliemann  claimed  that everyone thought it was a mythical place: this was to support his PR efforts, and make it look like he was battling against some entrenched view. He wasn't.   In reality the site was always known to be the location of Greco-Roman Ilion/Ilium, and it was generally accepted to be the setting of the mythical Trojan War. A few people prior to Schliemann had expressed doubts about whether it actually made sense to equate the physical site with the mythical place, but on the whole people have generally been willing to identify the site as "the Troy of the Trojan War" in the same sense that they identify Thebes with "Oedipus' Thebes". Contrary to what Schliemann wanted everyone to think, it's really pretty normal for myths to be set in real places.   In fact there's probably more resistance  now  to the identification of Troy with "mythical Troy" than there was prior to Schliemann. People are still expressing serious doubts as to the importance of the Bronze Age site, its identification, and so on. But not many people doubt that the site is the same as the one that 7th-century-BCE Greeks knew as "Ilios", and I don't suppose anyone would deny that Ilios is where the 7th-century-BCE Greeks considered the Trojan War to have taken place.   Now, Schliemann also put a great deal of work into conflating  the existence of Troy  with  the historicity of the Trojan War . That's a separate matter. Not many ancient historians do actually believe in a historical Trojan War in any very meaningful sense, but there are some very notable exceptions. But if you equate "Troy is real" with "the Trojan War is real", you're doing Schliemann's work for him! Anyway, the
Huh? No. I'm saying that paying attention to the cars around you while NOT paying attention to how fast you are going is pretty stupid and reckless and dangerous. If you know how fast you are going, you  should  be able to determine a minimum safety distance to the car in front of you, if you suddenly need to emergency break (like if the car in front gets into a collision or whatever). If you do not know how fast you are going, you are going to be unable to determine this safety distance, and as such, you are a lethal danger to the person you are driving behind.   Consider this: you're going 80mph on the highway or freeway or wherever you are. You're going 80 in the 65 because "everyone else" is doing it. It's packed with traffic, so you're all cramped up behind each other, because I hear tailgating is more common than clean underwear in the US (my assumption that you are American may or may not be correct, I am aware). Let's then say that one of the cars in front of you gets into a crash. Maybe the driver in that car survived the initial crash, through some stroke of luck. I mean, surviving an 80mph crash means you've had a guardian angel.   But what happens when the already battered and lifeless body sitting in the smashed car in front of you gets reared by yourself, in almost 80mph? Here's a hint: they are not very likely to survive.   Even if you put yourself at a long, long distance behind them, the fact that you do not know what your speed is means that you do not know how much of a breaking distance you need in case something pops into the road from one of the sides, etc. So, that's dangerous too.
No drug test either. So I was supposed to have an interview with another place in the mall then they rescheduled me even though I had showed up ready for interview, so I decided to go to the food court, and sbarro pizza had a now hiring.... And to my suprise I got an interview on the spot,  with advancement opportunities of advancement to manager.. He was very laid back and chill, I felt like I was just hanging out with a friend rather than having a nervous interview... And he totally looks like a ENT....  Here's me in my red shirt and black tie wondering if you browse this subreddit
In 2006 I was dating a friends sister (got his approval beforehand) for about 4 months, things were going pretty great, we were around the same age (mid/late 20s), worked in the same industry (entertainment media) in Los Angeles, got along great with each others friends, had great conversations about all manner of topics, and all in all it was looking like the beginning of a great relationship.   Then there was a surge in the attacks between Israel and Palestine to which she flat out told me that all the Palestinians should be wiped off the earth.  I asked her if she was serious, she confirmed, I flat out told her I can't be in a relationship with someone who advocates genocide and noped the fuck out of there.  It bears noting that their family was Jewish and she spent time in Israel throughout her adolescence (though her brother did not).   Though, I should have known better when her brother (my friend) told me "It's your funeral" in response to my approval request to date his sister.   So... at what point in getting to know someone do you pop the "would you like to commit genocide?" question?
Initially I hated it. But then I heard someone on MLB (I forget who) say something that changed my perspective a bit. It's not about expanding the playoffs and adding more teams. It is about making it more important to win your division. With the addition of the wild card, winning your division had become less important. Teams could coast in to the playoffs by way of the wild card and have just as much of a shot as anyone at winning it all. Now you definitely want to win your division, because nobody wants any part of that one game playoff. I still don't love the new system, but when I look at it that way it's better.
Bonjour!   Il y a beaucoup d'emplois disponibles en informatique dans la province. Il dépend surtout de la qualité de vie que tu veux avoir.   Montréal: beaucoup d'emplois disponibles, bons salaires, bonnes possibilités de promotions et de travailler en anglais. Tu pourrais t'intégrer facilement et la connaissance du français va être agréable sans être vitale. Mais c'est une métropole comme toutes les métropoles, alors il faut aimer les grandes villes, les logements chers, le coût de la vie élevé, la différence plus marquée entre les riches et les pauvres, le taux de chômage élevé (+-10%) et le fait que la ville ne dort jamais.   Québec: Même s'il est facile de trouver du travail, il y a moins d'emplois en informatique, et ils sont moins bien payés. Le français est essentiel ici, spécialement en informatique. Ce n'est pas facile de travailler en informatique en français, car les mots employés sont souvent difficiles et bien des québécois francophones ont de la difficulté (l'informatique étant un domaine surtout anglophone). MAIS le coût de la vie est moins élevé, le chômage est pratiquement à 0, la vie est beaucoup plus agréable (opinion personnelle) car la ville est assez grande pour qu'on y trouve tout, mais assez petite pour apprendre facilement à la connaître. Il y a beaucoup moins d'immigrants ici et la ville est beaucoup moins cosmopolite.
So, recently, I've been trying to build up the confidence to ask out my very good friend (we were attached at the hip) of 8 years out, but we aren't currently very good friends, more like acquaintances. That's because in the middle of 7th grade I started going to a different school than her. Fast forward to beginning of this school year, we are back at the same school, but our relationship never really got back to where it was before.   We still talk from time to time, but we haven't hung out outside of school/school events. We share the same circle of friends, and we all eat lunch together.   How should I ask her out? Should I tell her my feelings for her when I ask her out, or during the date (if she says yes)?
With the end of the season and a new Queen on the throne, it's safe to assume that the throne has not passed down the line of succession.   First off, with the Baratheon side of the crown completely gone, the crown would fall to the Lannister side. A lot of people have pointed out that Jaime is actually heir to the iron throne however Cersei stepped up and took the crown.   It's a weird thing to happen because how did she come before Jaime? Now she might be older but that's not how the line of succession in Westeros works, the titles go to the males, so in theory Jaime should be King. So this means Cersei had taken the throne by right of conquest.   No one else stands in her way (in Kings landing) no one with a large army to stop her (in Kings landing) and everyone in kings landing is probably shitting bricks over the Sept being destroyed with wildfire. So with this happening is it safe to assume the throne belongs to the Lannisters (we know it has for the series but now it does in name).   We all know there are wars to come but I've been seeing people wonder why and how Cersei got into power and this seems like the most logical thing to me. Any input or disagreements will be great (I love discussion).
I was playing Fifa and this happened and i was wondering what would happen if this was a situation in real life. Let's say i'm red team and the other team is blue. A player on the blue team slide tackles a player on the red team, deserving of a red card, but the ref plays advantage and will give the card when the ball is out of bounds. the play goes on, the blue team gets the ball after a few passes. Then, the blue player that committed the foul scores a goal, then gets a red card. The goal counts. Would this same thing happen in a real life match?
Pretty mild compared to most. I was 18ish and had a female friend who was 19ish. We met when my friend changed to an "alternative" high scool and started dating her. Fast forward a year or two and I am now in that school and my friend is not. Over the next few years we become friends but never date or hook up but definitely have some tension there. She starts dating a 16 year old kid who works at the movie theater. Hang out with them both. Become friends with the kid. He lets us see all the new movies that summer. About half-way through the summer she brings up that he is a bit of a goody goody. Kisses but wants to wait til marriage to do anything further. This is not my friend at all. She is a total nympho. Pick her up one day and go back to my house to smoke a bowl and chill out. Bowl gets done and she kisses me. Totally blind sides me. Never thought we would ever do anything. So one thing leads to another and I end up going down on her for over an hour. As I'm going to town she gets a call saying she has to go into work early. The next day we go see a movie. Get let in for free as usual. Can't look him in the eye. Halfway through the movie we start making out. Hear the door open and we stop. He comes up and starts talking like usual. Needless to say this went on for the rest of the summer. She finally broke up with him before he went back to school. Still feel terrible because he called me up crying because she broke up with him. He never knew.
So my girlfriend and her mom (both strong Christians [mom calls me the "unbeliever" and wants her to break up with me]) got into it today about her moving to a certain part of town and getting a dog. As far as financial planning goes, my girlfriend knows her shit, but her mom is to caught up in her idea of correctness. Midway through the argument the mom says, "You're trying to move out foolishly, dating the unbeliever and having sex, do you really think God approves of anything you're doing?" to which she responded, "God would want me to go out into the world to learn to take care of myself and make my own adult choices and be better suited to follow His plan."   Naturally I agreed with my girlfriend in an awkward way, but I found it funny how God wasn't actually a uniquely defined set of rules, rather the projection of their own wills as to the correct courses of action.   Thoughts?
How likely is it that the printed map you purchased contains the most recent information about any questionable area? How many editions come out each year? Does the store youbpurchase them at always have the most current edition?   Nowhere in your 'herp derp why I dont trust newfangled devices get off my lawn technology herp derp' do I detect any sound reasoning other than you've found an exception, an isolated example, to show the internet how "rational" and "reasonable" you are by sticking to your guns and telling us that old media shall always reign supreme.
I (38m) have lurked her for a while as many have. I spent a quite a bit of time reading and scouring the interwebs for information on the various aspects of these lifestyles. Reason being that my SO (40f) has been a part of it for a good majority of her adult years. I on the other hand grew up sheltered and then got wifed and kid real early on. Fast forward many years and I finally bloomed.   So here we are, the SO and I have decided to get a little creative. It has come up off and on over the years as to trying it out. She wasn't sure about getting into it though I wanted to. Well for about a month now we've been giving it an unsuccessful shot. I guess I cant really say unsuccessful bc the communication has improved exponentially now that my desires have come out in the open.   Here is what is throwing me for a loop. This probably has more to do with how my brain processes info. So as I said I spent a great deal of time reading about the do's and don'ts in regards to life on the swing. How to setup boundaries, how to not force, don't set expectations, talk, etc.... And we have been doing that. Before we set out for the first night we said that everything but penetration was on the table. Ok, that seemed fair. Lots of fun to be had without going to whole way. So we went to the local club and ended up meeting a couple. They were nice but nothing happened. Was late in the night and he was fairly toasted already. There was some caressing going on but nothing more. So the next weekend we went back. She was approached by a man and he proceeded to massage and proposition but she wasn't feeling it. Not her type, so she politely declined.   So now this week is upon us. We have planned to go to the club again but earlier and it appears that she is dead set on getting it done. I cant really say its a problem, but as of this morning she has changed her mind and decided that it would be easier to just allow each of us to date on the side. Only rule being that we don't do it in our bed and that if things get emotional then we talk about it. And of course we talk about it all. No secrets. Sounds great right? Yeah so far with my searching getting people to play in a foursome is a bit more difficult than the 1 on 1. My only concern is the rate of progression. I hate to say something like this considering I'm a 38yo man, but I've got some things I'm nervous about. You know the typical man stuff such as performance anxiety.
Hi guys. So I believe this is a somewhat unconventional post for this sub, however in the past I have known the good people of reddit to be kind to self-confessed programming noobs like myself on some occasions, so here it goes...   I am a student of graphic design and have recently applied for a position as a junior UX designer. Having solid knowledge of UI & UX tools and practices I was pretty pleased to get a callback from the company to come in for an interview. Now here's the problem... unknown to me at the time and described in a later job description, the role also involves a basic understanding of coding to take said designs and implement them into finished products. At first this threw me as my only experience with coding has been a shall dive into HTML5 and CSS3 over a few Summer classes, and having taken advantage of a few free online courses such as Code Academy & Khan Academy in my spare time.   In light of this news I am considering getting in touch with the interviewer to explain my unawareness of the coding element of the job and pass up the offer, but before I do and throw this opportunity into the wind completely I just had to ask... how realistic is it for an amature like myself to gain a basic understanding of these programmes in a limited amount of time? I understand how hard coding is and the ongoing learning process, but what can I say to express my previous coding knowledge? And what are the basics that I really DO need to know?   Your advice is super appreciated!
You need to put the whole draft in context before you consider a trade bad, and why a team wants to trade down has a place in the value they are looking for. Each pick doesn't have a set value whether people want to believe that or not.   My favorite example: The Raiders traded the #4 pick in the draft for the #13 and an extra 3rd rounder back in 2013. The Titans grabbed the 20, the 52, and an extra 1st rounder next year for a pick that they had no direction with. Picking up depth is never a bad thing, especially if you don't like the guys at the position you are picking.
I had a co-worker at an old job who was absolutely addicted to poker; so much so that he was quite in debt. He was undobutedly a very good player, but he just couldn't hold onto his money. A typical addict. One time he asked if I'd lend him $50 to enter some online tournament as he frequently did (he'd never asked for money previously), and that he'd pay that money back plus half the prize money, regardless of whether he lost it.   Now this guy might have been an indebted addict but he was very good in repaying the everyday 10's and 20's you occasionally spot a friend or co-worker. I considered it but then in my conscience I told him I wouldn't give him the money since not only would he lose out for it, but that I wouldn't want to put him anymore in debt.   He tells me it's my loss, then enters the tourney anyone. Next morning he's got the biggest shit-eating grin on his face. He'd wont $14,000 that night. I'd lost out on $7,000 because I didn't want to see him throw his life away. Most expensive mistake I've ever made.
I live on an equatorial island in the Pacific. We had torrential rains -- flash floodings --- last week.   There are no "fully organized storm systems" here in Micronesia, yet, the rain has been very heavy. The ground is saturated. There is runoff pluming in our lagoons, polluting our waters and killling our reef ecosystems.   Thank the heavens that we have been spared loss of life on our tiny islands.   Monsoon has always taken its toll.  Whole economies in the Asia/Pacific area are impacted by the Monsoon   Are these weather patterns the worse that I have ever seen in my life?   The answer is "Yes and No".   We are used to tropical cyclone warnings (aka hurrcanes/typhoons) for which we can prepare.   But, inundation from these unorganized systems is a new phenomenon that the weather services of the region need to understand to help our communities from experiencing futher loss of life.
I love life . . . I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that something could make me feel that sad. It's like, it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid. I'm very happy to be sad at the moment."   For the past few years I've been introverted and not made many friends. The past two weeks I've been in Cyprus with my family, I assumed it would be a normal boring holiday and I'd end up being lonely. The first day I went to play football as it was an organized event, I saw another guy there obviously my age. I said hi to him and we got to know each other. That night he asked me to come play cards, I met another few guys who happened to live near me which was great, I still text them now. I also met the staff there too. The next day I happened to meet a german guy in the bar whilst me and my new friend were watching football, me and this guy ended up going out clubbing which was amazing for me as it was my first time, this guy was great too he was travelling africa. Then he left, but i'd still been out clubbing with the staff. The next day i was a bit bored, said hi to some girls who were english around 21/22 at the quiz night, met friends with them! Amazing for me haha. Then the next night the staff introduced me to a guy and his sister also both at uni, we all went out clubbing that night and it was one of the best nights of my life, jumping in the pool at like 4am, getting no sleep. I ended up cuddling this girl but going no further. Then the next night I ended up clubbing with the staff again and a guy I met who owned a pub that we went drinking at. And this whole amazing experience started from simply saying hi! Now I'm back home and I'm very sad it's over, but I'm happy that I didn't spend my holidays at home on my own!
stats-wise I first deck..     the amount of Critical Chance I want to end up with   the level critical hits / condition / healing that I want to see (Power/Condition Damage/Healing Power)   the 4 digits that I like for my Armor Rating (Toughness)   the rest into Vitality     traits-wise, I then check..     what/which concept I wanted to play/see in the profession   what I can compromise    what I can get away with     and finally-- combat-wise, I try to crack..     which weapon sets I will want to have..  on a pressing offense on a retreating defense   which skills on 6,7,8,9 and 0 that I can rely on..  to reflect what my build is aimed to do to make my stance/decision be known to both allies and target     on an extra note, probably best not to forget; on an tertiary level.. runes and sigils to fill in for the flair I'd like to see in-combat!
First time poster, so be fair with me. I've used the search function and didn't find anything regarding what i am about to write. Or maybe i just searched wrong. Anyway.  I was rewatching GoT from S1 to S5 and something caught my attention, which i hadn't realized up until now.   Since R+L=J seems to be the least tinfoily theory out there, this might give a hint to it in the season(s) to come and be some sort of evidence of a slight truth behind it. As far as i recall, D&D got the showrights cause they could answer GRRM some questions, like who is Jon Snows Mother.  Now, i had wondered before, if this is going to be a thing and is also important for the series, why aren't either Lyanna nor Rhagar mentioned more often? Lyanna and Rhaegar (or rather dialogues mentioning them) are nearly absent the whole series, besides Season 1. Even the Ned-Fever is very different, compared to the book (the dreams are missing.) Until ... now?  In Episode 4 of S5 it hit me like a truck. There are at least 3 parts that i find highly suspicious.   The first one concerning Jon Snow directly. While he is training his guys in the courtyard, Stannis and Selyse casual talk about him. Selyse says something about "Bastard by some tavern slut" and Stannis responds: "Perhaps, but this wasn't Ned Starks way" Just a little line, directly overshadowed by Selyse's bitching about how she hates her Daughter and not being able to "give" Stannis a son. Whether we take it as Stannis is thinking very highly of Ned Stark and Jon Snow, because they have taken the honorable way (which, i guess, Stannis in his own eyes is also pursuing), or as a: 'Seems unlikely that honorable Ned Stark would sleep with a tavern wench.' is up to us. I Believe, that D&D are capable of very smart writing, since in the 2nd scene after that one, Melisandre tries to seduce Jon, because ... "Shadowbabies"? It has been established since season 2, that "there is power in kingsblood". Maybe some foreshadowing as well. And here the clever writing kicks in. Maybe, if the scene ended there, people would have thought about it more. But what follows is the heartbreaking speech of Stannis to Shireen (especially if you consider her burning later on.)  That made me suspicious. Maybe because we all wait for TWoW to be released, or mabye the Series is somewhat trying to follow some book plots till the end, with the R+L=J the most important one.   However, as i said, it could just be something Stannis thought of right at that moment, unless ... The Scene switches from Castle Black to the Winterfell Crypts, where Sansa is visiting the Grave of ... Lyanna? (It is not even mentioned, that her fathers remains aren't there yet. And i could very well understand, that she want's to say something to his grave, that she has been so stupid or whatever. But nah.) They talked about Lyanna and how Rhaegar made her his Queen of Beauty at the Harrenhal Tourney. Something that was not brought up until now. It is also mentioned that he was very much cheered upon, overshadowed by the fact, that "Thousands have died" and, here is the more interesting part: "He chose her, and then he kindapped her and raped her". This might as well only be foreshadowing for what will happen to Sansa later on. But, even if R had raped L or if their connection was consentual, it could have ended in L giving birth to J. Even though that might be a stretch. After that, the topic is switched fast to "The North will be yours" speech from Baelish and his creepyness. And so, the short L+R thing is fast forgotten. (You met the Boltons and Stannis, but never Rhaegar or Lyanna ... so, who would really care? Besides, the next scene is the super-duo Bronn and Jaime, who would care about anything before that?)   However, there is still a 3rd scene concerning my hypothesis. The last scene is taking place in Mereen. Barristan and Daenerys talk about Rhaegar ... as well? Awkward. Barristan tells Daeny how noble and beloved Rhaegar was, what they did together. And how they laughed together. From the way Barristan tells his story (and he had the kingsguard of quite a lot of people and didn't shun away from telling Daeny what maniac her father was.), he pictures Rhaegar as a very kind person. Someone who would steal and rape someone? Probably not. And right after that talk, the Barristan fight scene with the SotH (epic, but sadly he dies :( ) happens. Something you would clearly more care about (and even remember more.) As i said, i think D&D are very smart. In my opinion they put those hints there deliberately and tried to overshadow them with even more spectacular bits, what they imho accomplished. And they did those things for all 3 scenes that are somewhat connected to either Jon, Lyanna or Rhaegar.   So this leads me to my conclusion. Why putting these bits, even if they are very thin, into the episode at all? Those bits about R+L=J have never really appeared before (besides Roberts hatred for Rhaegar and strange love for Lyanna in Season 1 - and there it mostly had been to explain the bond between Robert and Ned, aswell as to establish why Robert was king in the first place.) So i just freely assume, that it has to mean something, which would be: The Jon Targaeryen reveal will happen. Because they just could've filled anything else in as "smalltalk". But this is far too convenvient. 3 Bits of the same "theory" in one episode seems suspicious to me. And to put a little tinfoil around - the whole theory is popular called R+L=J (always in this direction) ... in the Episode it goes J=L+R. (And therefore i could even say, Jon will be back. But i have of course no proof for that.) And well ... i hope he will be back and revealed to be a King. Or Azor Ahai, or whatever. I hope.   What do you think?
Why so much focus on "machines becoming smarter than humans?"   Doesn't "AI superintelligence", complete with consciousness/motives etc, require some form of "artificial life", which we aren't even close to developing yet?   If we humans eventually understood intelligence enough to bestow it upon machines, wouldn't we upgrade ourselves to superintelligence first, before worrying about creating artificial super-competitors from scratch?
Haha, thanks. I didn't think The Monkees were a real band either. I watched the movie Head (one of my favorites now) because I'm a big fan of psychedelic and experimental film. I liked that the whole thing was The Monkees poking fun at themselves and their legacy. I kinda saw it as if someone like Justin Bieber lashed out against their manufactured image with something crazy and unexpected. Since I loved Head so much, I found myself wanting to see their TV series, so I set about marathoning all 58 episodes. To my surprise, I absolutely loved it. Just as experimental and weird as the film. Stuff like Frank Zappa's [weird as fuck guest appearance](   I guess what's most important is that I found myself really loving their music. Which makes sense, as they had a bunch of songs written by people like Neil Diamond, Boyce & Hart and Harry Nilsson, and some obviously talented session musicians. But there was never a song that The Monkees didn't do all the lead vocals on, so they certainly weren't lip-synching. And as I found out, they didn't have other people play the music because they were totally untalented, the studio wouldn't trust them to play on their albums until they really fought for it. Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork were actually accomplished musicians before the show. Dolenz practiced hard and became a good drummer. Davy Jones... well, he could bash a tambourine real good. By the end they were even writing about half of their own songs.
My bf (21m) and I (23f) have been together for about a year and a half. We've broken up once before but got back together after a couple months. He broke up with me again last night. I'm pretty upset, and also worried, because this is becoming a pattern with us. I'm afraid that we'll end up getting back together and the same thing will happen. I'm also afraid we won't get back together, but I'll be sitting here waiting for it.   Anyway, breakups almost always suck. This one totally sucks. I feel sick to my stomach and I'm trying not to panic. If anyone could take a second to drop some advice or cheer me up, that would be really awesome. Thank you all so much.
He is asking you to talk to the developer as you evidently see his request for removal of the negative review as a problem. If you did not see it as a problem, you would not have posted it. This post will not help to solve the problem, however, speaking with the developer directly may.   >Not my problem. Notifiying the people of /r/pcmasterrace about this.   You have notified the people of a subreddit that a developer is addressing users concerns about his product and politely asking them to reconsider a review after doing so. I don't personally understand why you felt the need to do this, because it does not change anything, but I respect your decision nonetheless. Also, you seem to be making it your problem. If it is not a problem of yours, just let it be.
The Good:  Ok, she is great to me my children, her daughter is very sweet also and loves me, and she is beautiful, kind, and we have a great relationship together. She is intelligent, went to college and has a great career making about what I do, and we've been together for a little over 2 years and honestly we are closer than a bare ass to a plastic lawn chair in the summertime..   The Sketchy Part:  Lately I've been finding out that she is the kind of Christian who believes church goers screaming in tongues are her god speaking through people, believes demons exist everywhere and that they possess people at will, that the dinosaurs lived at the same time as people because the earth is only about 6000 years old, and that science, scientists, astronomers, biologists, historians, and mathematicians are all wrong and/or are satan attempting to test hers and other Christians' faith..etc;)   and well.. I am an Atheist who has been learning how extreme her disconnect with reality is, and who is beginning to get a little bit scared of staying the more I find out. Voiced my concern, she brushes it off and would be devastated to lose me but would before giving up any part of the delusion which concerns me..   My Concern:  Honestly I'm fearing that having someone around me with such a little grasp on reality could at any moment snap, gain a mission from god and wake up from a dream where "god" tells her to drown my children in a bathtub because they are "possessed", and then do it..   Christianity doesn't bother me, nor does really any religion tbh, but extremists and dangerously delusional people(be it for religion or schizophrenia or whatever) are dangerous and I worry that if the church, her god, or a dream or voice ever tells her to do something unthinkable much like many people who have snapped due to a "mission from god" since their grasp on reality was less than their dedication to the delusion, she might do it.   Sorry for the book, but what do you think.. I love her, but am at a crossroads.
Sigh, don't believe me if you want to, but trust me... It really happened. I cannot provide you with solid sources right now, but I can explain why and how. The Veneno was given to those Lamborghini felt would do the car justice. All you needed were connections. This guy was looking to make a quick buck. And boy be did. He got the car for its base price, sold it for much much higher overseas. As for the taxes on such cars... Google is your friend.
That only works for so long.  As an academic, i have absolutely no intention of going to the US, because i just couldn't stand the political atmosphere.   And the thing that scares me most is that there is now no civil public discourse, and so no culture of critical thinking.  The privileged few get it at good schools and universities, but - like i say - that only lasts so long.  (Semi-provocative asides: the lack of a culture of critical thinking is what scares me most about China, too; and the growing anti-intellectualism in Australia and the UK is also not a good sign.)
No.   A large  percentage of  Satanists are atheists.   The LaVeyans are the largest group  of Satanists -   >Contrary to popular belief, LaVeyan Satanism does not involve "devil worship" or worship of any deities.   > It is an atheistic philosophy that uses the character of Satan as a symbol  of pride, carnality, liberty, enlightenment, undefiled wisdom, and of a cosmos which Satanists perceive to be permeated and motivated by a force that has been given many names by humans over the course of time.   >Satan (Hebrew: שָּׂטָן satan, meaning "adversary") is seen as a symbol of defiance to the conservatism of mainstream philosophical and religious currents, mainly Abrahamic religions, that see this character as their antithesis   >In his essay, "Satanism: The Feared Religion", the Church of Satan's current leader, Peter H. Gilmore, states:   >>"Satanists do not believe in the supernatural  [when  he  says  "Satanists" here,  he  apparently means  "we Satanaists,  in the Church of Satan"], in neither God nor the Devil. To the Satanist, he is his own God. Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates. The reality behind Satan is simply the dark evolutionary force of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things. Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshiped, rather a reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will."   -   From  the  official  site of the C of S  -   >Satan to us is a symbol of pride, liberty and individualism, and it serves as an external metaphorical projection of our highest personal potential.   >We do not believe in Satan as a being or person.   > We are atheists.  The only people who perform sacrifices are those who believe in supernatural beings who would consider a sacrifice to be some form of payment for a request or form of worship. Since  we do not believe in supernatural beings  there is no reason for a Satanist to make a sacrifice of any sort.   > People who believe in some Devilish supernatural being and worship him are Devil-worshippers, not Satanists. Anton LaVey was the first to define Satanism as a philosophy, and it is an atheist perspective. “Theistic Satanism” is an oxymoronic term and thus absurd.   -----
Recurrences are a problem if and when they happen, no use worrying about them upfront. At the moment in time that you're already depressed, they're not exactly relevant to your day to day.   For your day to day, the best you can do is to take your limited energy supply, batten down the hatches of your social and commercial life, tell everyone "I'm going to be down for up to a year" , and to take this ride on your own time. The alternative is risking your self destructive tendencies tearing you and your environment apart out in the wild. This is Not A Good Idea (tm).   In the mean time, you still have to work on yourself together with your doctor and psychiatrist, that's what treatment is for.   I'm not sure what bee got under your bonnet, you're being really nasty without good reason. Have you dealt with many cases of serious illness in your circle of family&friends?   The first thing to do in any situation where the shit hits the fan is to calm the heck down, and figure out your first steps using your brain, not your gut. No matter what the odds, you need to figure out what to do to minimize damage, and maximize survival. Worrying about things that aren't going to happen until way later isn't going to help in the here and now.
I'll try to make this short, but it's a crazy story.   My mom and I are incredibly different - I'm a feminist, she has admitted that she likes being controlled and that once married she believes a woman should completely submit to her husband. She's quit her job to take care of this man and his 4 kids despite the unstable tendencies of the relationship and expects me to integrate myself into their family as well. I'm 21 and in college with a part time job and two research labs. I don't have time to get to know a whole family especially since I REALLY dislike kids. It's also very uncomfortable because the daughter who is 6 or 7 will say really awkward things. one time she said my SO needed to shave his head and grow a beard to "look like daddy". She also asked if I'd date a 37 yr old (her dad's age) - I said no, I like younger men and she called me a 'bad girl'. I've only seen these kids 3x but they always talk about how much they love me. My mom then beams and says how much I mean to them. It's fucking weird and I have to spend Christmas with them. I know it's only one day but the past few times I've hung out with them my blood boils.
Warning, longer story   In my country during the late 90s, there was some kind of "cat and mouse" game show on prime time television where one contestant (tracker) had to track and hunt down a pair that was trying to hide from the "tracker". The game went on 24/7, but the tracker could only catch the pair during a live broadcast on friday evenings when the pair had to broadcast themselves from a telephone booth somewhere in the country. Not only did the tracker have to catch them on live television, he/she was required to have filmed the pair at 2-3 separate occassions during the week without them knowing it. There were many other rules like the pair only got to stay in one municipality for 24 hours then never got to stay there again but these rules are not important.   Since the show was really popular, kids all over the country tried to imitate the show, including me and my friends, with whatever resources middle class kids in the 90s had access to i.e nothing so the game just turned into a convoluted mix of hide & seek and tag in our suburban neighborhood.   We had a rule that the "trackers" had to spot the "tracked" twice before catching them, but never at the same street or general area. Of course there was no way for the trackers to prove that they had spotted the tracked anywhere, so by the time the tracked were caught the trackers had to tell where they had spotted the tracked, they could just deny that they had been there around that time. Every time it all devolved into a heated argument with zero proof from either side.   Years later, I suddenly realized that if we just had two modern smartphones, one for each team, we could have made an awesome game. The trackers just had to show photo/video evidence and the tracked could have made video updates every fifteen minutes or so to prove that they were on the move.
the character is an inanimate projection of an obstacle built into the game. Any emotions felt toward it would be akin to emotions felt toward the wind or a sand trap when playing golf..   I'm not 100% sure on that. I mean,  we have the saying "suspension of disbelief" and people love to throw around terms like "immersion".  These are all things relating to "buying into" an experience, where we temporarily forget/ignore/are distracted from, the fact that it is a game and the events are happening "on screen" not "for real".   I would agree that true romantic love is a very complex human emotion, and the idea of being able to actually feel that for a computer animated character is probably a bit of a stretch at this point. But things like infatuation, or genuine care, sympathy certainly seem more plausable.   Take the Character of Alyx Vance in Half life.  If bad things happen to her in the game, many people have mentioned that they end up feeling something  more  than just "the loss of a game mechanic" (co-op partner) and the game being harder as a result.  They grow fond of them.   Admittedly it's very much a personal taste thing, and how much each individual person gets invested in the game experience they have. I can imagine for some people it's very hard to see how others don't feel exactly (or rather, the lack of feeling, as we are talking about here) the same as they do.  If I feel nothing playing video games, it might be hard for me to imagine people who are that invested that emotion comes into play.   They very concept of "role play" is an example of this. There are people who play games who actually try to identify with their character, flesh it out, etc. Then there are others who the very idea of "role playing", even in a RPG like Skyrim, is seen as simply absurd.
Whiterose, and by extension the Dark Army, are 100% Chinese government sanctioned. This is proven:   A. by the extensive finance and resources of the Dark Army. They need serious money and power for the kind of shit they've done. Shit that goes beyond crime syndicates.   B. Whiterose obviously works for the Chinese government officially. This already puts him (her) in a position of power, trust and a position to be the head of the secret taskforce like The Dark Army.   C. State sanctioned secret hacking groups have precedent in history, with China and Russia.   D. Price mentions getting finance from the government to bail out ECorp. Why would he mention this to Whiterose unless he knew she was in cahoots with the government?   Okay. So now we've got that cleared up. Whiterose, by extension China, is essentially trying to destroy America, bit by bit, to become the world's sole superpower. By destroying it's economy, and in stage 2 it's infrastructure (more to come on that), China gets to not only outplay America, but also: "Benevolent China gets to bail [E-Corp] out", placing them in a position of international power diplomatically and financially, and internationally admired.   Now for what stage 2 is. Elliot mentioned before (I can't remember where exactly, would appreciate somebody finding the quote) that the first step is to destroy finance, which has obviously been completely. The next step is  infrastructure .   The next step is America's, or at least New York's, power grid.   The evidence for this is:   A. The above quote.   B. Public faith in the government is already extremely low, without power, they risk falling into revolution. This is obviously where the show has been heading since the beginning. I don't need to prove this.   C. [The constant references to nuclear power throughout the episode](   D. The brownouts, and mentions of the strike. Why would they be in the script if they were not significant to the plot? This is to show that the power is already waning, that at least New York is currently dependant on alternative sources of power currently.   E. The most obvious. Whiterose's interest in the nuclear power plant with Price. Why would she care so much, allowing herself to be talked down to so badly by Price and getting so much money from her government, if it wasn't absolutely  essential  that she gets it?
Hello /r/sex, I'd love some advice/insight on a problem I have. I'll try to give all the background you need. A couple weeks ago me and my SO lost our virginity to each other. Since then we have had sex around seven times or so. The problem is when I am on top, I have a lot of trouble getting in. When we do foreplay I can still really only fit one finger into her vagina. It's a real challenge when I am on top laying there to get it in even if I use my hand to guide it. We usually end up having her on top after a lot of struggling. She is a really great gal and doesn't mind most of the time. I was wondering a couple things here.   1) Might it have to do with my penis having a very upward curvature? When I am erect it points up pretty far but I can move it down perpendicular to my body.   2) Is it maybe her just still being pretty tight down there and not a lot of work?   3) Would it help if I were to be on my knees and kind of move her body towards mine rather than laying down. (It feels pretty awkward to me anyways laying down and figuring out how to move my lower body in the right way.)
There ya go :]   The lesson: Don't take shit so seriously.   If you go around taking everything at face-value, you'll miss all the subtleties underneath. With human nature the way it is, it's tempting to assume that everything around you is dumb/wrong and that you are intelligent/correct, but immediately jumping to that assumption is dangerous and foolish.   And even if someone/something is as ignorant or imbecilic as it appears, having a hostile reaction serves no one. When the ignorant are attacked, they double-down, view themselves as victimized, and it reinforces their ignorance. When the imbecilic get insulted, it is demoralizing and debasing, and can lead them to internalize their stupidity, thinking they have no way to be intelligent.
I'm looking in majoring in and making graphic design my career. I'm in love with graphic design as a career choice, but I'm not sure yet what I want to do. I was definitely thinking along the lines of 2D, not 3D, and looking for something that would pay decently well (non-starving artist, enough to be confortable/not have to worry money much). I am interested in web design, but not sure if I would have to learn programming...in which case I'm not really interested unless it's basic HTML that I can get by with for good/great websites as a result. I'm currently working on my AAS. I was wanting to get a BFA in graphic design, but I'm currently active duty military and cannot take daytime classes...so I would have to complete most of my BFA when my enlistment is up, at which point I would be 31 when I graduate! Yikes! An AAS at community college is easier to achieve right now, because they offer more online and night classes. There's only one 4 year university in my area that offers a BFA in graphic design and they only offer the graphic design courses in the day time :/. So, I'd like to stick with the AAS. They offer a certificate along with the AAS which is called The Communication Design Level I Certificate, which "provides basic training and skills through specific courses that may lead to entry-level employment."
Witnessing the propensity for experiences like these (and others similarly bad) in my clinical observations as an undergraduate caused me to realize that virtually all of the problems with education in the States were cultural, financial, and managerial--virtually none of which any single teacher can affect. The fact that your supervisor didn't trust your character first before the word of a student (you're guilty until proven innocent), the fact that your supervisor was somehow completely out of options due to the activity of just one crazy parent and her child illustrate this.   Consider the matter in virtually any other industry. You have a client who's acting like a nutcase for your legal practice, and they decide to tell all your other clients that you're a hack. You have a patient flipping out on your medical practice, and they decide to tell all your other patients that you're not to be trusted. You have a constituent loosing their minds in your political ward, and they decide to tell all the other voting citizens that their city councilman is a total looser. Seriously, where else would one single, wayward, nutcase have the power to completely derail an endeavor as a matter of course? The system really is the problem.
My son is 8, with autism and some really difficult and negative behaviours.  We really do our very best to keep him from hurting his sister during a tantrum, but he will connect - pull hair or scratch - probably a few times a week.  It's been a stressful summer, to say the least - his outbursts have increased a lot, and we are of course dealing with that - increasing therapy, sorting out anything that is causing him problems, and all.  But I've noticed - suddenly - his younger sister, who is 5, has picked up a few of his social behaviours.  Like just not knowing how to interact easily with other kids.  This seems new, just over the summer and I wonder if the stress has caused a small regression?  Anyways... lots of background for this question: how can we support our daughter?  We have started signing her up for afternoon classes like ballet and sports, so to get her out with peers her age.  Any thoughts?
Burials require resources and land that could otherwise be spent not wasting space on land that is already diminishing at extreme speeds.  I'm all for people doing whatever they please with their bodies when they're dead, but it'd be better if everyone could migrate to organ/body donation + cremation.  Saves a ton of land with no more graves needing to be dug, less timber used for caskets, less energy output to move the body and dig the grave, etc etc.
I'm 23 years old and I've been thinking about the things life offers and what I should pursue. I graduate this fall so that's one thing off the list. No debt, average income so far.   Anyway, apparently people grow old. I was just at a conference a few weeks ago with some younger people from my college. I'm starting to notice how girls are starting to avoid me slightly more than before and guys aren't putting much weight on what I'm saying. We don't really talk about anything deeply philosophical or serious but just fucking around and talking about them girls. I feel like my wits are fading and I no longer have the edge to make people laugh and it's getting worse the older I get. Some things that appeal to them just don't get to me and I feel I have to force myself a bit to get into rhythm. For example some guy jokingly asks me where I'm going and I either reply with an actual serious answer or say something disproportionately stupid. As you can imagine this doesn't work well with girls. I have a girlfriend and before you judge me - I've never cheated. I'm the kind of guy to catch fish and let them go for a while now. But I can't even catch them anymore. Everyone else is exchanging spicy comments but if I try that I'll just come off as creepy. I've noticed this gets worse with age. I know this guy - great dancer, great talker; always catches the eyes of girls. As I get older, I know I'll never be as good as him and it feels more and more like my window of opportunity has passed.   I'm moving in with my GF of 4 years soon. We argue daily so I'm not too sure about what's going to happen. She disapproves of my current lifestyle - thinks I'm lazy, that I don't work enough despite me making more than her and that I play too much video games (I admit there's some truth to that). She expects me to stay in our home town and live with her when I graduate and gets upset to the point of crying when I tell her that I'm going for a master's degree. She also wants a shared bank account because she wouldn't have any money when we move in together due to her supporting her parents (who can't work due to medical conditions) and paying some of our bills. I'm still delicately trying to tell her that although I don't want shared accounts I'm still going to help her financially. She's having none of it. She doesn't want to try and get a better paid job because she feels safe where she is. With her coming here to live with me it feels like my fate is getting sealed. I love her and I have nothing against us living together but I still get this painful feeling that some aspects of my life are about to end. A few months ago we had a huge fight and almost parted ways when she confronted me about my lack of desire for children. I hadn't even considered it before she dropped the bomb on me. There was much drama but at the end of the day I reasoned that children aren't necessarily bad, despite my apathy for them so far and I didn't want this to be the reason for the end of our relationship. She just wanted an answer and wanted it now. Made me feel like I've wasted her time if my answer was "no" (she's 22). She doesn't want kids right now, of course, but she has told me that if something happens accidentally she's not going to take the morning pill or an abortion due to fears of becoming infertile (we usually don't use condoms because it's uncomfortable for her). Yes, I too like to live dangerously.   I have considered breaking off our relationship but I really love her and care about her. I also feel like if I were to be single, I would have a really hard time getting a new GF or new "acquaintances" due to what I talked about earlier. Being alone is scary, despite having obvious advantages. Like playing games all day, working out, washing dishes once every few days and going to the club with a group of male and female friends. I also want to get better at my job. I feel like I could work day and night for days when I get really engaged. I've also considered moving to a new country - something my entire family has been pushing me to do for years. However my current GF is not going to move with me because she wants to take care of her parents. I don't blame her at all for that, all I want is to explore my horizons.   Anyway, this rant is getting too long, thanks for reading. I'd love to hear your thoughts on my situation and your own experience.
Did you or did you not read my initial comment  fully ? Read it  again . It's like you just read the first goddamn sentence of my comment then went "
I've only taken dxm twice. Once was 540mg plisterix and the other was 600mg hbr and I'm 16 years old 140lb/64kg. I used to always just smoke one or two bowsl from my bong and a have a good time but now I'll have a second plat trip if not a third plat trip. Sometimes the visuals will be just as intense as when I took 600mg or close to it. It can be very inconvenient especially the first time it happened to me and didn't realize it was happening until I was until driving. I just started driving a manual car and it was fucking hard as fuck for the first two minutes then I pulled over had to wait about an hour and a half and then drove home. Then last night I was deep in the dextroverse for a solid two hours.   I'm just wondering if this will go away and I just need to wait. Or if I need to take a break from all substances because of serious health risks. I wanted to take 600mg again next week or the week after but maybe I shouldn't anymore?
Perhaps I am just going off hearsay and jumping the gun, but I recently read that the impact of asteroids unleashes enough energy to bond elements and form amino acids.  If this is true and some feel that the reason the moon orbits the earth is due to it previously being just another asteroid that hit and got stuck in the gravity of the earth, do you think that the moon is the cause of life on earth?   I could be completely off, I am by far not qualified in any means to teach or ponder astronomy, but feel free to chime in.
smoked some 5f-akb48 on the tail end of some a-pvp amd i am stoned, in my rush ii accidentally dabbed 4x my usual sleep dose and as soon as the hit entered my lungs i realized "Fuck, This is what a j should feel like" not 10 minutes ago i entered another dimension something i couldn't even achieve smoking hash all day after edibles.   [1:08:55 AM] Straight as I inhaled all of my thoughts and feelings were immediately verbalized in an internal monologue. I started to notice things that my mind did I wasnt even aware of as i slipped into euphoric dissociation.   [1:10:25 AM | Explosions of pleasure are going off all over my body, It felt as if my whole body was ringing. Hands down the best high I have ever had.   [1:10:26 AM]  i wonder what taste  is   [1:11:14 AM]  An airplane flew outside and i felt like there was an a-bomb about to go off, Hearing sirens in my mind, watching the whole scenario play itself out in my head. I was fucking there.  In a really scary but magnificent way   [1:13:33 AM]  wondering if im gonna trip into a seizure [1:14:25 AM]  this feels like heroin and ketamine Sorry i just want to share this experience feel free not to read it i just wanted to let somone know about it before i fall asleep and forget it forever :/
I was asked to repost this by a mod, and I was more than happy to oblige.   I'm Pagan. I'm Pagan because it is the best way for me to describe how I feel about the world. The beliefs that are shared by the majority of the Pagan community are beliefs that I've held in my heart since I was very small. I don't prescribe it to anyone who doesn't feel a connection to it. To each their own.   As to what I believe about Gods: I believe that there is a thing out there in the universe somewhere, some kind of grand thing that just is. Its bigger than all of us combined, bigger than all of humanity, all of the plants and animals on the planet, all history of Earth, future and present combined; its completely unknowable. Its impossible to comprehend as a whole. And some people (not everybody, and that's just fine) feel called to connect with it for one reason or another. Each reason is equally valid. Everybody's reality and truth is their own. In order for It, the Ultimate Divine (for lack of a better descriptor), to communicate with us/us with it, we make/it makes different aspects of itself for us to communicate with. It wears these aspects like very complicated masks, and the masks are called Godforms, or The Gods. In order for us to connect with a specific idea, we connect to a specific Godform.   So, for example, if I have a knitting project that I'm working on that I'm looking for divine inspiration for, I COULD look to Jesus, but knitting isn't exactly Jesus' thing (although, I would bet that he would like it). It is, however, Athena's thing. So I ask Athena for help. She is the master, and pro at all things related to knitting. She will totally be able to help me. But when I have had the worst of shitty days, and I seriously need a hug, I don't turn to Athena. She is definitely not about hugs. Jesus, however, is TOTALLY good with hugs, so for hugging, I would turn to him. And probably cry at him too. In both cases, I look like I'm turning to a specific and seperate God, but in truth, I amturning to a mask of that Ultimate Divine that is out there, and I am turning to the Ultimate Divine that is underneath that mask.   I believe in this because my heart yearns for it, and because it rings with a true note in me when I think on it, or hear it said by someone else.   I also believe that each person has a different resonance, and a different note they ring to, and that each person's note varies with degrees of faith and belief and personal truth. Which is why, I believe, we have many different gods, and many different religions. I believe that each person is perfect, no matter who or what they are. And that, like genetic variety, religious variety is healthy, and only serves to strengthen all of spirituality.   I believe a bunch of other stuff too.   I want to add that I am only speaking for my personal belief, as Pagans are really wide and varied in their beliefs, and in no way can I speak for all of us.
I read the books before I watched the show and even though I more or less 'know" what is coming it is still freaking awesome. It's very much an example of the journey not being important because of where you end up, but rather what you experience along the way.
I was conscious for my extractions too! Woot! It's definitely weird.   In my experience the pain got worse until about the 4th day, then it tapered off rather rapidly and was basically gone after 2 weeks. Definitely don't wind yourself up reading about dry socket on the internet...if you have dry socket you won't be able to write a particularly coherent post because you'll be writhing around or back in the OS office. I found coming off the narcotic drugs to be much worse than the pain of the extractions, because I would be frustrated at work over nothing at all and couldn't figure out why. My job is very physical and requires lots of lifting, bending over and full-strength exertion so I took a full week off and am very, very thankful that I did!   Eating lots helped. Soup doesn't have many calories so I'd mash up avocados and fatty stuff with my blender into the soups and make awesome purees that couldn't get stuck in the extraction sites. Lots of spinach and even meats if you want - just be sure it's blended up really really well! Just about any food can be blended and will retain its flavor, by the way. Stay really hydrated, that helps too. Be sure you are sleeping enough - I was sleeping like 14 hours a day for about 3 days...it really helped, even if I felt like a bum. Don't drink coffee if you do...helps you sleep, plus hot and cold things felt terrible around the extraction sites for about a week. Be sure you keep up on your overall hygiene like showering, shaving, etc. - it will just keep you feeling normal and gives you something else to focus on. Definitely floss and brush like normal as best you can, but be gentle and  slow  around those 2nd molars - that will cut back on the shitty taste.   Use the oral irrigator and not the Waterpic, it's easier to modulate how much force you're putting into it. With the Waterpic you can sort of set the speed but you ultimately only have on/off control. Even on its lowest setting I'd think the Waterpic is probably going to be a little bit too much for comfort. The irrigator is your friend and you should carry it with you until food isn't constantly getting caught in the extraction sites.   Take all of the antibiotics and don't smoke.  Use ice and not heat, it reduces swelling much better.
This was a few months ago, but I was just thinking about it and it's too ridiculous not to share. Looong story, but I think it's worth it!   So a friend of mine called and asked if I could do his boss a favour. The boss had just taken over a bar, with no previous industry experience, cleaned house and was desperate for staff. I was unemployed, so despite my  major  misgivings about working for first time owners who have not at least a few months in a bar/resto under their belt, I went with it.   Things started going wrong at the 'interview' and went steadily downhill. First, the location. It was in a suburb of NY which is a bit of a dodgy town to begin with, but this was in the heart of a clearly very poor, under invested area - i.e. obviously no disposable income to spend on drinks. No cell reception for my carrier - relevant later. My interview consisted of a 'Yeah, you'll do - can you stay and work til 2am?' and he took off. Uh, okay. I stepped behind the bar and oh holy shit.  The floor was about 3 inches higher than it should have been as it probably hadn't been cleaned since the bar opened in the 70s. When I tried pouring a draft just to check, half-inch lumps of mouldy, yeasty  goodness  fucking disgusting grossness poured into each beer. (As an aside, I 86'd draft and refused to serve it til he had a pro come clean the taps. He tried to do it himself, I'm not even sure how, but I stood firm.) Then I checked out the stock.   We had I think 8 different types of bottled beer - but we only had about 3 bottles of each! I even sent a pic to my friend bemoaning 'What am I supposed to  sell ?' I've worked in working class 'hoods before - I  am  working class - and people don't have 2/3 beers and leave - they have 9+. And they are attached to their brand. If you run out of Bud they're not going to switch to Coors. They'll leave, usually after making a fuss about it.  A somewhat good natured fuss usually, but still.   Liquor. Holy fuck.  I think everyone in this sub knows what a  stocked bar looks like.  I found a flashlight and checked the bottles... uggggggghhhhhhh. Upwards of ten fruit flies in every syrupy/brown liquor bottle. More 86'ing.  I couldn't ditch them (yet) as I'd been there around 15 minutes, and boss man was gone.   Okay, I'm rambling, so some bullet points.     So concerned about his bottom line he mused on straning the fruit flies rather than waste the bottles. NO. Also phone service got cut off and he couldn't pay for a few days. RELEVANT.     Maybe  3 customers a day spending about ten bucks each. My shift pay (which was actually generous) was often more than the ring. That's why I stayed for a couple of weeks, 'cos hey, unemployed.     I told him close for a week, clean, restock, re-open. He couldn't...here's where the 'mafia' come in...       Some guy owed him $xx000 from his other business, and said 'Hey, I can't pay you, how about I give you my bar instead?' WTF!?! After he took over, guy decided the bar was worth xx000+(some amount) and started harassing boss to pay back his  debt .   A stereotypical guido goon came in late one night and asked for his 30%. I boggled and he walked behind the bar, said he was the boss and here to pick up. He didn't physically threaten me but his demeanor.. I took him seriously. 'Sir, I apologize, I'm new and we haven't met. I'm sure you appreciate I can't give money to  anyone . If you call (boss man) and put me on the phone, I will if he says so.'   He backed up a bit and told me not to be scared in that Joe fucking Pesci way that means you should be fucking terrified. Called my boss. And says -     I'm very disappointed in you. And my father - his heart hurts.     We thought you were a friend of ours.     You know I'm going 'out of town' in 3 weeks. I'm just looking out for my father., he's an old man now. (He said this over and over)     Just because I won't be here, don't think that I won't see. Do you know A and B? Because I can send them here. (Boss clearly did because I could hear his voice rise to a kind of pleading tone.)     So what am I supposed to take 30% of? The fucking bartender?       Right after saying that he looks me in the eye and again says not to be scared of him. Still on the phone telling boss how disappointed his father is and he needs to fix it before his three years 'out of town'. I was WAY to scared to call the cops but slipped my cell in my pocket and asked him to use the bathroom. Sent a desperate - no reception - text to a friend - 'Come here; lunatic; u don't know me'. A few minutes later scary guy is still on phone, steps out to car. Warns me not to lock the door on him - he's smart. I was fairly sure from what he was saying on phone he was getting his gun. What for, I'm not sure. I don't think he was going to shoot me. Rough me up or sexually assault me - 50/50.   I want to tell you my friend arrived with 100 SAS guys, it's very tempting. But what really happened was fucking guy came back in, clearly packing but very apologetic for having scared me because he'd never hurt a woman. Went to the bathroom about 8 times in 8 minutes, I could HEAR his snorts and sniffles. Ordered a rum and coke, and left...promising he or his friend A would see me soon to pick up.   I actually stayed til close that night and worked two more days 'til I realized I couldn't do it anymore. I'm an idiot.
I'm fairly new to this, and have been a lurker for most of my time on reddit, but this needs to stop.   Our relationship is wonderful, not a day goes by where neither of us want to spend time apart. She is my first real girlfriend and meeting her family was a major concern for me. I was taught as a child to always engage in conversations and to respect my elders, even if they were only a few years older than I. I respect my girlfriend quite a lot, so getting her mother (the father is out of the picture) to like me turned out to be easier than I thought. Her brother was quite easy to get along with too, as we both like video games and adventure sports.   Fast forward to after the summer and her brother is going back to school. He's in a very important year, exam wise, and my girlfriend and her mom came down very hard on him initially to get his act together and to take this year seriously.   He resisted, naturally, and his mother just kind of backed off. She claims that because there is no father figure that it's normal for boys to act out. However, my girlfriend isn't dumb, and knows that he's lazy and also quite the asshole. There has been a number of occasions where he's disrespected me (He's turned off the tv on me, he took over her bed and made us sleep on the couch, he leaves me to wash up after him) and lately he's been disrespecting teachers and fellow classmates.   My girlfriend's mother had been dealing with cancer for quite some time and hasn't stopped working throughout. Thankfully, she's been cancer free for over a year now, but she's exhausted, all of the time. She really can't cope with work, then cooking, then cleaning, then his behaviour/attitude, so he basically gets away with anything.   My girlfriend has taken up the role of mother in the house and tries to get him to act like a respectful human being, but he makes her life a living hell over it. He doesn't care about anything and would rather leave the whole house dirty than clean it for his mother, to use but one example. My girlfriend has had to give out to him countless times, but her mother always ends up taking his side and my girlfriend then becomes alienated in her own home for about a week and the entire cycle starts again.   Anyway, my girlfriend finally lost it about two weeks ago when she tried to take away his laptop for the weekend; when he didn't clean up after himself; and he wore pyjamas to his Saturday maths lessons. His mother doesn't know this happens and even if she did, she wouldn't correct him properly. He basically pushed my girlfriend's buttons, by saying it's her fault that he can't relax in the mornings and then pointed out all of her flaws, so why should she be able to tell him what to do. She has always been respectful and quite frankly gives him way too much freedom, but she lost it, told him he was an asshole and burst into tears.   They haven't talked since, and the latest incident happened today. My parents had organised to meet the two of us for dinner and she was to get a lift from her mother to the restaurant. However, her mother was at the Pharmacy getting tablets with the brother. I was to tell my girlfriend when we were leaving and when to meet us. When I eventually did text her, her mother still hadn't returned, so she called her mobile. Her brother answered and said that she was still in the shops. My girlfriend asked him to run in and get her, because she was going to be let for dinner otherwise. He said no, and turned off the phone. Her mother didn't arrive home until 30 mins later and my girlfriend had to cancel.   She was so upset by it that she confronted him when he got home and ended up crying. She is so fed up with his sarcasm and spiteful nature. Her mother told her that she should see a psychiatrist after her outburst and that she should apologise to him. Her mother knows full well what he did, but simply told him not to do it again and left it at that. She is now too afraid to leave her room and he is sitting in the living room, watching a movie with his feet up, without a single shred of remorse.   I am absolutely furious, but I can't say anything, because he's the precious younger sibling and his mother would despise me if I said anything to her. This can't go on, and he can't keep treating my girlfriend like this. Please, if any of you could provide me with some advice for this situation I would be eternally grateful.
I was buying some other games since they have that buy 2 used get 1 free thing going on. With little hope in my heart, I asked the guy checking me out if they had any Captain Falcon amiibos in the back. He said no and I was like aight. Then, one of the other employees nearby asked me what I was looking for. I repeated myself and he reached under the counter, pulling out good ol' Cap'n. I swear god rays came down from the heavens to illuminate that man and Cap. He had been holding it for himself, but gave it to me. The selflessness. I've looked for Cap  across two states in countless stores, but I only got him thanks to the kindness of that man, so thanks random Gamestop employee! My brother and I are happier than you can even imagine. You didn't have to do what you did, but I'm so happy you did.
Sure. Thanks for asking. I'd love to hear your response. Sorry if it's a bit of a rant. I am very tired right now.   In a nutshell, cause they claim authority over something they shouldn't and cant, and encourage unhealthy thinking and wanna-be behavior. Mind you I like a few of the lists and have browsed it before. they have interesting links and the creator even seems alright. but, in the end I think that the site is kinda mindless and has no real heart. They seem to be trying to take a difficult to reach state of self and make it an imaginary commodity.   I think their gravest sin is their portrayal of ideal manhood. They want a well dressed (in a western sense) athletic man who can preferably grow a beard and knows all this great shit about the woods and stuff, how to handle money, and talk to ladies. it's a cultural stereotype turned into a commodity and then projected across a gender as a perfect form to achieve. It's as though they think there is a rough cookie cutter for what it takes to be a man.   Personally, I think anyone can be a 'man'. (including any other gender) The closest answer I have come up with to what makes a man a man, is that a man knows who he is and lives through that, into reality. It''s about embodying the value sets, beliefs, and reality of who you are in the reality you inhabit. What do you believe? ok, Why? that sounds solid, now who are you? Good!  Now go and live. Be the values and 'who' you are, while recognizing reality and reacting to it as you think best.   Further, the irony is that many of those stereotypical stoic men that rarely talk and have been through hell to live on in badassitude are often shattered on the inside and have compartmentalized trauma in order to function. It's one thing to be able to survive, it's another to be able to heal and keep living. I lived in the Middle East for a short time and played medic or had close calls a few too many times, and came home with combat induced PTSD. I found myself in an alien world without knowing why. I was always stoic, rarely laughed unless it was real dark humor, took things too serious, but also would wake up yelling or screaming at times, and in two cases woke up beating my girlfriend. Beating her. The person I loved. Holy. Fucking. Shit.  After some hard thinking I knew I could either keep going closed up and likely kill the next person who starts a fight with me in a bar, or try to become human again. And fuck was the second one harder. (Longer story) That state of compartmentalization is only good short term for mental survival and shouldn't be celebrated as a state. The men and women I have known who are career hardasses (the ones who make it look easy) instead share odd characteristics. Often they can laugh- even at themselves, are open minded, show or recognize emotions, are empathetic, have values, supportive friends and family, recognize their limitations, and are pretty ok with what they got. AKA they encourage their own mental health without faking a state. That seems different to alot of what the site states and I don't like encouraging that stereotype. That said, it can still be a fun site.   All that said, now the site is encouraging guys to go and learn survival stuff and woodman crap, and how to fight, and stuff. I like the challenge of survival and being able to be that self reliant. Or knowing how to fight. it's a great skill that can save your life. But in no way will guides online teach you without experience and further it's not for everyone and creates dangerous assumptions. Some people don't like learning survival stuff or practicing knots. But worst of all, some want to know that stuff or how to fight for all the wrong reasons. to be more manly. or to fight someone without thinking it through or trying to walk away. There are certain people I wont teach or talk to about certain things cause frankly they have no idea what I'm talking about in real world applications and they are children on the inside. lost in their own reality, in their own world. afraid to look at their own behavior, assumptions, and situation and gloss over it with guides, quotes, and opinion pieces.
One: it's Berklee Two: Be weary of Berklee, they tend to lose important transcripts that end up fucking you over and them forcing you to redo a couple of .5 credit courses after you've shown them your grades, and having the teachers say that you've taken them and gotten high scores.  three:
WARNING: GETS LESS AND LESS ELI5 AS YOU APPROACH THE BOTTOM   Well, the concept I'm using here is limits (which are insanely useful).  Imagine you want to know whats at the bottom of this really big cliff, but if you look over the edge to find out, you fall off and die.  That's bad.  Instead, you get really close to the edge, and the closer you get, the farther down the cliff you can see.  You don't actually step off, but you get really really close, close enough that you can pretty much see the answer.  This sort of reasoning is really helpful in squeezing meaningful answers out of infinities.   When you have two competing infinities, they can sometimes be expressed as either a function or a series.  In either case, what we're essentially doing is adding up a ton of numbers (literally an infinity of them).  If the function or series is convergent, then the numbers we're adding get small enough quick enough that we get a meaningful, finite answer (think Zeno's paradox.  You're adding up increasingly small distances which eventually reach a finite total).  If the function or series is divergent, then the sum just keeps growing and growing and never stops.  But some of those functions and series grow faster than others.   It's easier to think of this in terms of series (the logic is still the same for functions).  Imagine you have an infinite number of rubber balls.  You can order these balls in terms of size, each one being half the size of the previous.  This is like summing 1/(2^n) from n=0 to inf.  This turns out to equal a finite number: 2.  this means you could fit all of those balls into the space of twice the size of the largest ball (plus a little extra for the space between them, but that's just an artifact of the physical example).  This is a convergent series, because even though you're adding an infinity of numbers, the sum is finite.   Now take a new set of balls, where each one is the size of the previous one plus the size of the first.  In other words, s(n) = s(n-1) + s(1).  The sum of all those balls would be like summing all of the natural numbers (1+2+3+4...).  That is a divergent series, meaning it just keeps getting bigger and never stops.  Now, if we had an infinite number of all the same size ball (like 1+1+1+1+1...) it would still take up an infinite volume (that sum is also divergent).  But if you were to subtract the second sum from the first, you would be left with...the first sum.  This is where series get really weird.   Think of it like this:  You have (1+2+3+4+5...)-(1+1+1+1+1...).  You can distribute that negative and reorder the sum to get (1-1)+(2-1)+(3-1)+(4-1)...  which equals 0+1+2+3...  Now, you can use this to really abuse math and get some really weird answers (which aren't always correct) but the point I'm trying to get across is that infinities are not always equal.  Some are bigger than others, even though they are all infinitely big.   The way we use limits is we say "let's not actually add up all of those balls; that sounds like a bad idea."  Instead, we say "let's add up an arbitrarily large number of those balls."  This is kinda like saying we're adding up infinity - 1 of them, but not quite; we're stopping as close to infinity as we want without actually reaching it.  This let's us do the math without breaking anything.   Let's step away from balls and take a mathematical infinity: 1/0.  We don't like dividing by zero, so let's get really close to it without actually getting there.  Let's introduce a variable, which will be our regulator like I mentioned in my previous comment.  Let's do 1/(0+x).  That's much nicer!  We can set x as close to zero as we want, and we will still get a meaningful answer.  Now, as x gets closer and closer to zero, 1/x will get bigger and bigger without bound (it will approach infinity) but it won't actually get there until x actually reaches zero.  We can use this to figure out what certain values are, like sin(0)/0 (which turns out to equal 1 [but for that you need L'Hospital's rule, which is a discussion on its own]).   Anyway, the point of all this is that we can use the fact that some infinities can be expressed by an infinite sum of finite numbers to see which infinities are bigger than others, and we can use regulators to get as close as we want to infinity (without actually getting there) to see which infinity might win and by how much.
19 Male here, when me and my girlfriend started dating, well we were both a little big bigger. Not obese or fat but just, I'd say chubby. The both of us. Well since then I lost quite a bit of weight and am now almost considered skinny. She likes it but she said she loved me either way.   I love her and the way she looks right now and I'm scared that if she loses weight I might not find her as attractive. But no matter what she'll be the same person so it shouldn't matter to me either way, right? Also she complains a lot about her weight and it really brings down her mood. I just want her to be happy.   She's 18 Relationship length will be a year in 2 weeks
As the 1.0 version approaches, we will need some updates on the [rules of thumb](   Chor'gorloth decreases the cost of the ancients. Let's see the effect on the optimal level of HS when you don't have Morgulis, assuming you have 0 levels in Xyliqil as well (it is an independant problem, so we can seperate both).     Reminder : for high levels of Siyalatas,  Morgulis (or HS) = (Siya+22)²   With Chor'gorloth, the DPS multipliers don't change if you have both Morgulis and Siyalatas.   The constraint on costs becomes :   chorEffect   morg + chorEffect   siya * (siya+1)/2 = constant, chorEffect = 0.95^chor.   chorEffect can be considered as a constant in this formula, so the constraint becomes :   morg + siya * (siya+1)/2 = constant.   It's the same constraint as without Chor'gorloth, so the respective optimal levels are the same. Note that the levels will be higher than with Chor'gorloth.   &nbsp;   If you don't have Morgulis, we want to maximize the following function :   0.1   HS   (6.4 + 0.15 * Siya)   under the constraint   HS + chorEffect   siya   (siya+1)/2.   &nbsp;   If we write HS = chorEffect * A, we have to maximize   0.1   chorEffect   A   (6.4 + 0.15   siya).   We can remove the multiplicative constants, it won't change the optimum.   The function becomes   A   (6.4 + 0.15   siya)   under the constraint   A + siya * (siya+1)/2.   &nbsp;   It the same problem as the old Morgulis/Siyalatas optimization. So we can write :   A = (siya+22)²   HS = chorEffect*(siya+22)²  (that's what Morgulis would cost)
I found out something regarding my girlfriend of 9 months, and I'm not sure what I'm feeling right now.   Basically, we met through a friend. We texted for a few days, then met in person after a play she was in. We had coffee, and after I drove her home, I asked her out. This is how I fondly remembered the night we met. But there was an ugly side to it.   Before she became my girlfriend, she had a history with guys. Some kinky stuff that was rather unusual for her age when she started. She was open about it, and almost talked of it as a point of pride when we first met which I wasn't a fan of. I was a virgin and regarded sex as something really special, whereas her view was so casual.   I wanted to wait until marriage, but after a month she persuaded me into trying sex. It was bad at first, but eventually I got really good at it and in her words "no one else could ever compare."   She has definitely changed since we met. She now sees sex as something special, it meaning so much more when it's with a person you love. She tells me she wishes she had saved herself for me, and regrets her choices before me. But I didn't realize how deep that regret ran until yesterday.   She confessed to me that she had sex with a total stranger the day we met. Hours before we met. She knew we would be meeting that day since we had been texting about it, but she went and did this anyway. She said she never saw him again, and did it because she felt she needed to have sex with someone.   She was in tears when she told me this, saying she had no idea she was just hours away from meeting the love of her life. She was promiscuous, and had 3 or 4 men before me, viewing sex strictly for individual pleasure. That has since changed, and it is reflected in the way we behave in the bedroom.   I guess what stuck the most was when she said "At the time, I thought I was the luckiest girl out there. Fucked and asked out in the same day. But now it has become the biggest regret of my life.”   I believe that she is genuinely sorry, and I believe that who I love is not the same girl as the one who did that. But now I have no idea what I’m feeling… It feels like mixture of betrayal and confusion. I feel like she cheated on me, but she hadn’t even met me yet. We weren’t exclusive, so she had all rights to do what she did. But I don’t know… I guess its just serving as an all-too-painful reminder that the girl I asked out at the time viewed intimacy in the total opposite way that I did.   I still love her, and I still want to be with her. This hasn’t impacted my trust in our relationship, and I know that she would never cheat on me or even think about it. She has given me no reason to think she has been intimate with someone since we became exclusive. I guess I’m just looking for opinions and how to cope with this news.
I'll try to keep this concise. I've had about 6 lucid dreams in my life. I've started trying to implement reality checks in my life and I've had 3 lucid dreams over the past few months. A much better success rate than usual.   After peeing in a sleepwalking state, I fell back into bed while repeating to myself ("I will lucid dream now"). I fell asleep pretty immediately. In the dream I was at the gym doing power cleans when I simply realized I was dreaming. I dropped the weights to do a reality check. My preferred reality check is trying to push my hands through each other. It works splendidly for me. Well, of course my hands went through each other and I was giddy. Staying calm this time I spun around to deepen my dream. I then walked outside and got my jetpack (i can't fly solo yet) and took to the skies.   As I was flying toward the ocean to go for a swim, my dream was fading and I couldn't stop it so I woke up. OR SO I THOUGHT.   In my false awakening I was on the sidewalk extolling how amazing lucid dreaming is. I thought, no I knew!, that I was still dreaming so I did my reality check. Nothing. My hands acted like hands. I tried counting my fingers, five each try (although I was seeing double). I accepted that I must not have been dreaming and continued to talk about lucid dreaming. How you could travel to the bottom of the ocean (which I promptly found myself at the bottom of the sea). And then I talked about how you could go to space. I immediately look up and am rocketed into space high enough to see our entire solar system and all their moons at once trailblazing in exaggerated copernicun fashion.   Then I actually woke up from my boss calling me 30 minutes late to work.
Get ready kiddies, auntie praisedragjesus has a good old fashioned horror story for you.   It starts in the second grade. My grandmother has to go for knee surgery and can't watch me anymore, as she'll be recovering. I get my tubby ass dropped in daycare where I meet Liz. Liz was a nice girl, unusually kind to me despite being a few years older. (four and a half, to be exact.) We hit it off and were great friends until she turned thirteen and had to leave daycare, due to the cutoff age.   Fast forward about six years. I'm a high school freshman milling about the vendor's room of my city's yearly anime con. I see a familiar face and my heart just /races/. Holy fuck, it's Liz. Long story short, I approach her, we freak out over the coincidence, and exchange numbers. After a bunch of texting, it turns out that all that time ago in daycare, I was actively saving her life. I was one of the only people who treated her well, and of it weren't for that one little bit of sunshine, she'd have offed herself. She had a host of issues, you see. She was a lesbian, paranoid schizophrenic, and was somewhere on the autism spectrum.   And then, 19 year old Liz developed a crush on 14 year old me. She told me she loved me, how much I meant to her, was always giving gifts and wanting to hang out. She always seemed to know when I was up and the moment I picked up my phone in the morning, I would receive a text from Miss Psycho herself. One morning, I woke up to find her in my room, patiently awaiting the end of my slumber.   Needless to say, I cut all ties. Blocked her number. It's been over a year now, but just a few weeks ago, my girlfriend finally pestered me into making a Facebook. Within 3 hours of the account existing, I get a friend request from somebody with zero mutuals. Liz found me on Facebook. I've yet to accept or decline the request.
Hello, I posted this to r/bipolarSOs but there are way more people in this sub and sometimes, it's dead on that sub. It's a long one, but I hope to get some insight. Thanks!   I've posted on here before and maybe I need to direct it to r/bipolar. My partner and I have been through some serious shit as of recently, read my last post for some insight, and I had some questions regarding something we've been through. Although I've been trying to research Bipolar and get a better understanding, I guess nothing prepared me for a full meltdown with hallucinations/delusions, panic attacks, hyperventilating, shaking uncontrollably.   After they asked for a indefinite period of no contact (partly because their therapists recommended/asked them to) , I finally got a phone call three weeks after the last time I was contacted. They angerily said "why did you answer the phone?!" , they weren't really sure where they where, and probably the most distressing, "there's a bunch of cops here, I'm about to get arrested". This is two days before a two week trip back to his home and family in Ireland that was already causing much stress to him.   Long story short, I kept him on the phone and found him in a parking lot in his car. There weren't any cops. He wasn't getting arrested. There haven't been any cops for the last several times he thinks there are. But I don't know how to bring that up to him.   The next few hours were spent holding a shakey, gasping, mess of my partner. He said he couldn't breathe. He was making awful throat sounds. The saddest thing was he kept saying, " I love you, I'm sorry, I just want to go home "   I eventually coaxed him into my car and drove him back to my place. He calmed down a lot once he was there. As soon as we got to my bedroom he became very very sexual and physical. I figured since he seemed more of his normal self, I engaged. We had a few emotional issues, but the reason I am including this, is because he was soooooo into sex. It was like he was worshipping my body on an almost uncomfortable level. He wanted to do 7 different things at once and it was a frantic time. I couldn't keep up and he wanted to start involving things and clothes but it was 1 am in the morning and I had to get up at 5 and I couldn't make him understand that I wasnt rejecting him I just wanted to get to sleep. He wasn't overly pushy or violent or anything, more like he was really needy and passionate. He made it all about my pleasure. He kept saying how much he loved me and asked if I really loved him. He said I deserved better and was working on being a better partner. He was really sincere, open, soft and said I went through so much shit for him and he appreciates all I do and he needs to better himself.   Not even 24 hours later he withdraws, becomes super pissed (some of it my fault, but he overreacted massively) and refused to see me before he left. After I cry and called him and try to ask him to please say goodbye to me, says I need to "back the hell off and everything will be fine". And he " might " talk to me after he gets back.   Anyway, questions:   -delusions/hallucinations. Halp. How to I bring this up without setting him off or making him feel like I'm accusiy him off being "crazy".   -the sex life. Is this normal for bipolar disorder in committed relationships? He seems almost a little obsessed with me sexually. He will wake me up multiple times a night for sex and go for a long time. But he makes most of it about me and what I want. Maybe that's his way of making up for being a less than emotionally supportive partner?   the flip flopping. What is that? One second I love you so much and I want to work at this and etc and then the solitude and no contact and anger. Is this Bipolar or something else that I need to run from? It's getting exhausting. Closing thoughts: Does anyone else go from, " yeah I totally want to stay and work through this and be involved" to "I need to get the hell out or at least break it off until they get to a better place" ?
Hello Gabe!   First of all, thank you very kindly for taking time out to do an AMA with the Reddit Community, and I'm sure I can speak for many of us in saying that it further proves Valve's dedication to community and interaction as a productive business practice.   My question is this - Because Steam is moving increasingly towards user-created content and user-focused creation as a process, will Valve be integrating or developing tutorial tools to help its community to learn programming (I.E. Codeacademy.com), or perhaps even adapt itself to being similar to a modern-day, small-scale, 'free-to-play' digital learning tool?
i dont like full tank shen.  enemy team is just gonna ignore you so between taunt cooldowns you are literally worthless.  what good is 5k health if nobody is hitting you?   might as well go for some damage after sunfire and SV or get some auras (zekes, aegis)  and max CDR.   also if you are showing "highlight clips" , make sure you are not failing in those.  first "TP gank example" you coulda gotten double taunt.  second clip you shoulda waited for ezreal to E.  you were lucky he doesnt even see you coming so he doenst straight up Es your taunt and you waste teleport.
As so many start off here, the relationship between my husband and myself is great. Ours is really is too. Married a decade with two kids (boy&girl5) and couldn't be happier. Naturally we have our little spats now and then. Nothing that doesn't get resolved calmly and amicably. There is one issue that has never been resolved, and it's my MIL.   I have to say first she is a lovely person. She really is. Loving with her family, kind to others. Really I would trade my in-laws for the world. The only problem is when she's alone with me, while visiting our house. Which happens once or twice a year due to the distance between our countries, and usually for two to three weeks. So I rarely have to face this issue. That's part of why I've not said anything to her. My SIL(40's?) told me that the one time she and her husband(BIL and MIL's son) that it did not go down well. MIL was moody and wouldn't talk or do anything but sit on the sofa. It should be noted SIL has to put up with it more as she lives just a few hours away from MIL.   The actual problem? She has a habit of redecorating my house to her satisfaction. We have very different styles but I certainly wouldn't go as far as redecorating her home. For the ten years I've said nothing about it. Just waited till she left and put everything back. MIL also makes really nasty comments when she's alone with me. Such as:   "The way you put things is trashy." - because I have a few select cookbooks nicely stacked on the buffet table.   "Remember you'll never be a model." - I was trying to lose that baby weight.   In addition she tries to overrule my parenting decisions. If I tell the kids to do x she distracts them with a game. I've handled that by reminding the kids they will do x or there will be consequences (time out, losing toys). But I still haven't said anything directly to her. This most recent visit she was encouring my son to be a sore loser because he wasn't winning the game we were all playing. His sister was the one winning so MIL began encouraging my son to verbally take it out on his sister.   I've kept silent for a decade. I endure the comments and redecorating and the parenting interference. But after their visit is over it falls to a fight between my husband and myself. One that has never truly been resolved. He makes promises to say something on the next visit and never does. Claims he has said something once but has admitted he wasn't really clear about it. I know he can dance around an issue very well and never actually touch upon on it. So MIL really never has been talked to about this.   This last visit was really the final straw. Things said and done that finally pushed me beyond my limit. For the first time I actually stood up to her when she tried to redecorate. And boy did she get moody, and stayed that way for a good day. I haven't otherwise confronted her because I have issues challenging "authority" (they're parents and older then I and therefore cannot be talked back to) which I know isn't a great excuse. But the bulk of why I've said nothing? I honestly feel she'll take this better from her son. I want to keep the peace among the family and not damage their relationships. Also - I'm pretty sure that if I confronted her she'd believe my husband doesn't agree and consider it sometime of insult.   And it's like every visit over the last decade. I keep quiet, put up with it and get really stressed out and ask my husband to please say domething. He doesn't. I confront him after they leave and we fight and he makes the same promise to talk to her next time. Then doesn't. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.   How can this damn cycle be broken? How can we resolve this without offending his mother and hurting the relationship between her and my husband? Would I be wrong or overreacting by leaving him if he doesn't say something the next time they visit? Because, really I'm that far past what I'm willing to take.
I'm not sure what I'm doing in posting this, and I apologize in advance for the length... I guess I just would like if someone here could maybe help me sort through what is up with my family. I've been trying to put the pieces together to figure out why everything I read in this sub seems so familiar to me despite the fact that I actually think my (biological, I do have an Nstepmom, but that's a whole other story) parents actually care about my well-being.   I guess I should start by explaining the situation with my immediate family. My mom has obviously got symptoms of BPD, which caused me issues growing up. She left my dad for no apparent reason that either or he or I can figure out (quite frankly, he's the best guy I've ever seen her with - the rest have been abusive, and downright scary) when I was 7. Long story short, there was much upheaval until I was about 10, when my dad met Nstepmom, and my mom met the drug addict abusive guy who fathered my sister, then there was even more upheaval, for me at least. Mom obviously favored my sister, and has even said on occasion that she was disappointed at how I looked when I was born, stating that she expected me to have my dad's blonde hair and blue eyes (traits my sister somehow ended up with despite the fact that her father was not blonde), and was disappointed when I looked, well, just like her. From the moment my little sister was born, I knew she was the favorite, and she still is. I can deal with that though, as my mom tries her best to downplay the favoritism (this is why I don't think she's N, because despite having a lot of behaviors in common with narcissists, she actually seems to have a conscience and to actually care about others - she is just often too wrapped up in her own feelings to consider those of others, as those with BPD are wont to do).   I guess what I'm trying to figure out is where my mom's behaviors came from, and with some things going on with her side of the family lately, I think it's starting to become clearer. My mom has 7 brothers and sisters, and according to all of them, my grandparents on that side were perfect parents. However, the behavior exhibited by my mother and my 7 aunts and uncles says otherwise. It seems like FLEAS all over the place. Recently this just became glaringly obvious to me, as they've decided that one of my cousins (age 12) is suddenly their new family SG. According to what I've been told, I previously held that place, but I have been LC with that entire side of the family ever since two of them blew up on me on facebook for no reason over a year ago. I got lambasted for talking about computer viruses and how to avoid them, which my uncle for some reason took as a personal attack because I disagreed with his belief that people on his friends list using facebook apps could somehow give  him  a virus, which resulted in him sending me verbally abusive messages then blocking me so I couldn't respond. After that, and a similar freakout from one of my aunts, I just decided that it might be best not to communicate much with that side of the family at all, which was easy since they all live pretty far away and my only contact with them has been through facebook. I have since deleted all of them from my friends list, and even made a second facebook account under a fake name so I can enjoy participating in facebook with my actual friends without my family hunting me down to harass me.   That said, they've been attacking my aunt about her son (my aforementioned cousin), saying how she is not raising him properly and he will grow up to be a criminal, etc. etc., and my mom says that it used to be me they said this about, attacking my mother's parenting of me (she just told me this recently, which has made it clear to me that part of my issues growing up is that she actually seemed to have partly believed what they were saying, and treated me accordingly like a "bad kid," which compounded with Nstepmom doing the same to me, since my parents had joint custody). Additionally, I went to visit this same aunt when I was 13 and her SO at the time raped me while I was there. My mother had to pretty much force me to tell her what happened, and when she tried to confront him about it, the entire family (yes, all of them, not just those involved) accused me of lying and accused my mom of "trying to cause problems" in my aunt's relationship.   Add to this that the same uncle who sent me verbally abusive messages on facebook then blocked me has been sending my mother verbally abusive messages over some other petty thing (which she's pissed about, though when he did it to me she said, "oh that's just how he  is !"), and to the fact that I started discussing this issue with my father, and he pointed out to me that he always found it strange how my maternal grandmother never seemed interested in her grandkids or her kids when we visited, preferring instead to lavish attention on her pets, I'm starting to think grandma was an N. I never knew the woman. She died when I was 8, and all I remember about her is the food she cooked when we visited her (she lived 3,000 miles from us, and I think we visited about 5 or 6 times before she died).   So, if you managed to read through all this craziness, what do you think? Is it likely my grandmother was a narcissist? It just seems like all of her children are exhibiting these N behaviors and I can't seem to figure out why else it would be happening. I know it seems odd, but understanding this helps me have some closure, since I've pretty much gone NC with that side of the family (my mother excluded; I keep some contact with her), and I just want to understand the reason for all this insanity.
Still be careful though, once paypal settles a dispute its final.  I once ordered 25 dollars worth of stuff from a site, and they never sent me what I purchased.  I kept emailing the site and they just made excuses and said that it was on its way.  some months later I never got what I paid for and filed a dispute with paypal.  Paypal sided with the site despite not showing any proof that they had sent me the product.
The "ITT" comments.  God, I just hate them... It's like they're trying to do a really shitty, unfunny
This is a bit lengthy, but changed my life. Not just the way I think. When I was young my father abandoned me twice as a child. I grew up to be a very angry and depressed young man. I truly hated him for it. In high school, I had this amazing teacher. He helped me, and so many others, in so many ways. But one day he asked me something. He asked "You hate him right?" I said yeah. He said "And he deserves it right?" And, again, I said yes.  Then he then he said "Do you think he feels any of your hatred for him?" I thought for a few seconds and answered "No. He probably doesn't." And then he said "But you feel all of it. And you don't deserve that. It's time to forgive the man. Not because he deserves it. But because you do.". He was completely right. I forgave my father, and over time have built up an incredibly close relationship with the man. And I could neve have gotten to this point without my teacher.
this is the logic of someone trying to fit evidence to a predetermined conclusion. while its impossible to prove either way, theres plenty of reason to think he isnt botting, and the only reason to think he  is  is that he has a lot of viewers.
After making out with my high school crush for the first time after a sweet ass camp fire, we end up sharing a sleeping bag together after a  getting housed off of what I can only presume were Mike's Hards and Smirnoff Ice's (cuz I was a BAD ASS in high school).   (important note: the sleeping bag was my friend's younger brother's... suited for one average-sized fourth grader)   After a sloppy make-out session in our newly cramped quarters we fall asleep spooning each other. To my surprise, when I wake up we have shifted positions and are now facing each other.  Also, I wake up to find that my bladder is ready to explode.  And like every guy knows, your body tends to fight this urge to piss your pants in your sleep (if only that had been my embarrassing moment), by giving you a raging boner to wake up to, which I discovered was conveniently lodged between her legs.   I don't want to wake her up in this compromising position, so I feebly try to wake her up just to check her sleep status, but she doesn't budge, so I'm thinking I can just wiggle myself free.  I use the old waistband trick and tuck my hard-on up  and slowly wiggle my body free.  This goes surprisingly smoothly.  All obstacles passed and my entire upper body is free of the smothering sleeping bag. The final obstacle was her chin/neck/head area.  This is where I proceed to wake her up with my newly patented alarm clock... my boner which conveniently untucked from my waistband at that exact moment.... and slapped her right ON HER CHIN.  It was an impact Mike Tyson would've been proud of.   Safe to say that was the last time we hung out.
Kick back guys cause this one is a little long:   Tonight after the gym I went outside to fill up an ice bath with some water to ice my ever present injuries. I turned the tap off and headed inside flicking my free hand to dry it. I felt a slight movement on my finger, heard a quiet 'TING' behind me then a slight rustle of leaves.   I felt the blood slowly drain from my face as it dawned on me that my wedding ring slipped from my finger and into the thick, overgrown scrub on the very steep hill behind our home!   I came clean instantly, and asked my wife to get some torches as I began hunting through the dense layer of leaves and twigs I could see by the light of our porch. We searched for what seamed like an eternity before my wife calmly told me to go and ice my foot and have my dinner.   I was devastated. She kept telling me not to worry, that it was just a ring but I was adamant that I would find it. She didn't want me to because she was concerned that I may aggravate my injuries further and may get bitten by the snakes/spiders that pop in to say hello at our back door from time to time.   Not good enough for me. This was a symbol of our love that I had grown accustomed to wearing. The only piece of jewelry to touch my flesh had become a part of me, much like my very understanding wife. There is a high probability of heavy rain this evening, this sign of my devotion would be washed away in a storm if I left it until morning. I had to find it. Tonight.   I dressed in full length thick pajama pants, my long sleeve unwashed work shirt from earlier today, a thick pair of socks pulled up over my pj bottoms, threw a spare torch in the top pocket of my shirt and trudged off to the bottom of the hill. I did not care what the neighbors may think about my odd fashion sense... I had to find the ring.   At the bottom of the hill I located the light of our back door through the scrub and pushed into the tangle of branches that blocked my path, scanning with the torch. The first thing I saw in there were 4 or 5 dirty great big toads sitting dead still and eying me as if to say "What the fuck are you doing in here mother fucker?!" Great start to the search.   I managed to dodge most of the spider webs and only disturbed a few toads. Thankfully our friendly neighborhood carpet python or his enemies, the baby browns, did not make an appearance. The branches were tough on my hands as I used them to pull me up the incline and they scratched at my face and neck. I made it all the way to the top of the hill but alas: nothing.   I took a moment to regroup and rethought the sequence of events. At this point I started to get smart and went to the most logical location. The base of the tangled bushes where their roots left the ground. I was scratched, bitten (ironically on my ring finger) and beginning to feel thoroughly defeated but I couldn't give in.   I ran the torch over the leaves and my hands through the organic mulch, hoping a white tip spider or a toad wasn't going to find it's way into my grasp. I looked up... And there it was. The dull reflection of the torch on white gold buried half way into the leaves about 2 meters down the steepest section of the hill.   I eased my way into the scrub one last time and snatched the ring up, thrusting it onto my now itching and red ring finger. So today I am grateful for my very understanding wife, my plain but incredibly important wedding ring, and the luck that I had in finding what, for all intents and purposes, was a needle in a haystack.
I'm in the military and I've been home about two times the last 2 years. I decided to make a visit to my family this weekend for the 4 day we get. I tried to commit suicide a few days ago and I got reported for it. I was doing better but I've been feeling on and off the entire time since that incident. Now that I'm home I just feel crazier. My family is still a mess; they didn't have furniture still (I've never had furniture growing up because it cost too much money) so I went out and bought them stuff. My brother, mid 30s/ unemployed/ has a kid, acts ungrateful towards me. This is the first time since in ages that we have a sofa so it's a huge deal. I work so hard for my money and I didn't have a problem spending it on them, I just wish my brother would say something nice to me. My mother enables him and my other sister despises him. I can't talk to anyone here. I feel even worse here than I do at the base. I'm not doing this non purpose but my sister told me "How would you feel if I went over your place and acted rude and angry" she told me to stop acting like a baby and because I have control over my emotions so I must want to act this way. I hate how unproductive, angry, dirty and poor my family and the house is after all this shit. I sometimes feel like I don't belong anywhere because I'm miserable on base and I'm miserable back at home. I wish I would've gone through with killing myself because this isn't worth it. I feel so alone and so angry and I don't know why.
In film there are apparent cinematic achievements that can be accomplished and such accomplishments can include a wide variety of things such as technical innovation, advancements in marketing, story telling and production, and the collection of accolades (academy awards, film festival awards, etc). The films that win awards or continue to stay important in pop culture throughout the years could be considered great as evidenced by their awards in the same way that Michael phelps is great because of his gold medals. However, the way that I see it, a person who only counts on the accomplishments of a film, director, or actor to justify their judgement of the film doesn't really experience or enjoy films as objectively as they ought to. There are a lot of films that have won awards that you can argue in your opinion didn't deserve to win. I don't think I'm alone here in saying that Avatar was not a "Great" film. However, it's achievements deserve to be recognized.
It's like this. Computer monitors emit light (RGB). Printed paper doesn't (CMYK). If you design something in RGB and print it out the colors are going to be muted compared to your computer screen. It's the difference between a flashlight and a wall painted white. If you start out by limiting yourself to the CMYK spectrum you'll have less colors to work with but you'll also be working more accurately and closer to what the final product will be.
So i was sitting in the classroom thinking of the current meta and how it affects the current jungle. What do you think is the current meta in the jungle? Do you prefer having a nautilus/udyr/cho gath going GP5 and alot of support'ish items, or do you prefer a nocturne/mundo/lee sin going bruiser build?  Also which junglers do you think of as "good"(or even the best) for counterjungling/defensive jungling?
Okay. So as I was watching Hardhome, I was finding it hard to believe that the Others would attack at  literally that exact moment .   Like, if they move the speed of normal armies (which is what I know everyone assumes), then to get to Hardhome literally 20 minutes after the Watch does would require some serious coordination that would make me suspect that there's a Others-defector in the Watch.   But then I got to thinking about the other (heh) times the Others have appeared. Otherly.   I don't have my books, this is a hasty, back of the napkin kind of theory at the moment, but from what I remember, there have been 3 instances where we have seen the Others attack.     Prologue   Fist of the First Men   Hardhome (show only)     We also know that they have been herding the Wildings to and through the Wall. Picking at their rears, driving them forward.   Lets assume that the show was not pants-on-head-banana-sandwiches-crazy.   Are Valyrian Steel Swords Acting As A Beacon To The Others?   Or possibly Obsidian.   I guess this theory relies on the idea that Waymar Royce was packing.   But seriously. If you had one supernatural weakness (or two, I guess), wouldn't you want to keep tabs on it? And attack it when you found it and had the advantage?   My personal theory is that the 'Others' - not the walkers, just the bosses (the ones that are "the wind" or "the cold") can actually teleport. And they can sense where either/or/both Valyrian Steel/Dragonglass is.   And when they sense it North of the Wall, they strike. Thoughts?
Man, here's a tip that will greatly improve your life but you wont realize it until after you've implemented it: watch games instead. Stop watching people talk about games 24/7. Fuck ESPN. If you want a good roundup, there are good daily 10 minute sports headlines podcasts that can catch you up on what you've missed. Or, if you must, go to ESPN.com or Yahoo for an overview.
Had some maths on Tal Rasha increase on liming dps, so why not sharing :)   Level 20 liming burst is:     796 (3 missles)     244 to 713 (orb)     542 (calamity)     425 (wave of force)  Total  = 1763 +   244 to 914 = 2007 to 2494       Tal rasha brings 5% to 20%. Missles and orbs have to be cast first. Since missles always do more damage than orbs, orb must be cast first at 5%. Missles at 10%. Then wait for hitconfirm, finally wave of force and calamity (you can calamity during WoF animation, before it touches the enemy).   The resulting total is 2782 damage. Thats a (small) increase of 11.5%.  Without Tal rasha, baleog, erik and abatur are ontshot. With tal rasha, chromie, liming and tracer are also oneshot, providing you hit the orb at maxrange (the last 5/6th of the range).
I went to a hole in the wall fast food Indian place all the time at my college, up until one fateful incident. I showed up right as they opened and got the combo, which came with naan bread. The owner was working the register and said it would take a few minutes to make, to which I said 'sounds good'.  As I go to sit down he calls me back over and goes off on a 5 minute rant about how it was 'the fucking stupid Mexicans' working for him causing problems.  And he kept dropping all sorts of slurs, with them standing right there listening, almost like he expected me to agree and chat with him about how bad Mexicans are. I just stood there shocked   I'm sad to say I ate the food I already paid for, but have never been back and tell everyone I can to avoid the place.
My SO (M21) and I (F20) have been dating for over a year now, and are starting to experiment more sexually. We've tried anal play/prostate stimulation using my fingers on him, anal penetration, being tied up, etc. I asked him about toys the other day and he was very open to the idea, which I was excited about. I've always kept my kinkier fantasies to myself, but I was pleasantly surprised how positive he was when I shared some of them. We had this long discussion, and some of our ideas for playing with toys include:   ~buttplugs   ~vibrating underwear that he has the controller to (for playing in public)   ~prostate stimulators (not sure if that's what they're called, but something along those lines)   I've been looking into some of these items, but it's so hard to tell what will actually work well and what's not worth the money. As a college student, I don't have a lot of extra money to spend on toys that stop working after a couple uses. So, what specific sex toys would you suggest based off of your experience with them? Was there anything you and your partner loved or hated? Feel free to include anything I didn't list, I'm new to the whole sex toy world.
Gw2   In this particular case, because the gameplay is actually very good and involved, I mean, take a game like Wildstar whose main point of attraction was the mechanical skill you needed and you'll find what is essentially a less elegant version of the GW2 combat, only put in a game with actual hard content. The game is dissonant that way, where the combat requires twitch skills in theory, but the PvE content is so easy most people don't realize how good the combat is until they try the pvp gamemodes.   Also because the story isn't particularly good, or interesting. Calling it a story driven game is a bit of a stretch. Just because they make an effort to add narrative context to their updates doesn't mean it is their number one priority, and it shows. You could fault anet for a lot of things, but they really do try to make interesting gameplay every time they push something out. They've been iterating on some of their current concepts since the Karka update from '12,  they're determined  on adding fun concepts for people to play. However, the story in season 1 was the most basic filler you could come up with, littered with half-thought out excuses for gameplay additions (c.f Tequatl Rising, Edge of the Mists, The Queen's Jubilee).
Invested?  Really?  That's a nice assumption considering you have no idea what I use and you must not have read the parts where I agree they are overpriced.   If your sous really needs to have chips ground out and welds redone, that isn't the fault of the knife.  You can fetishize them all you want.  They are just tools.
Well this is all just what my friend has tried to tell me!   he went nexing with his friend and he died. when he died he tried to buy back from death but the problem here is that he couldnt buy it back! idk if this is a bug or just something that possibly went wrong for him to not be able to reclaim his items!
I try to play roughly 3 to 4 hours per day. I used to try and get 5 levels per day. Had a significantly positive win loss record, decent K/D, and spread out my character usage. I always play to improve team comp, look for ult synergy, communicate with a mic, switch heroes when checkpoints are reached, etc.   Competitive came our and I lost 8 out of 10 placement matches. Ranked 39. I generally play with a large group so there's always 6 players in constant communication. Nearly every single one of them ranked in the 50's or higher so I'm constantly low man. It's embarrassing and disheartening and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I've climbed as high as level 46 but over the last 4 days I've won a total of 3 games. That's playing solo competitive with a mic, groups of 3-6 with mics. I watch professional streamers, read strategies, utilize the practice range, but it all seems to just be for naught. Just get constantly stomped. I don't see any reason to play quick play pubs anymore as there's nothing to gain but experience, but I'm rank 117 currently and I feel like if I'm not playing against people who are trying and playing objectively, what's the point? I won't get any better and the instant I go back to competetive I'll just go right back to getting dumpstered.   So
As someone who doesn't have any form of martial arts training who likes to play around and wrestle, I would also be freaked out/ get upset if the guy I was playing around with whipped out a choke hold on me. You should explain to her that it was an instinct reaction from your training and how sorry you are that it happened. I also understand why the trust exercise was not well recieved. I see her side as, you guys being playful and messing around (even though it gets heated). In any standard horsing around situation, it should never get to the point of choking. Again, I know it is reflex from your training but remember, she does not have the training and may NOT want it. Maybe she just enjoys being physically teasing with you.
The first time I notice that something was different was about five years ago. I was getting out of my car and all of the bricks on my walkway were grass-free. I was looking because I was so happy to finally have a weed whacker. Then I noticed that all of the bricks were whole. Normally, the third brick from the driveway, two bricks in is cracked. It was cracked in the middle into three pieces. I stared for a minute and then thought, "Maybe my wife fixed it with a spare brick from the back yard." I forgot about it.   The next day the crack was back. I saw it, and did a double take, but since my hand were full of groceries and the dog crapped on the carpet in the house, I forgot about the crack in the brick.   I remembered later and asked my wife if she switched the brick out then switched it back. She informed me that she doesn't touch the yard work and definitely didn't move and bricks.   A while later I was listening to a podcast about a man who collected coins from alternate realities. Small trinkets that slipped through the cracks of the universe. I am convinced that this was what was going on with that damned brick. I am freaking out a little now, though. It is beginning to happen with more things. Things aren't how I left them. Not things that my wife, daughter, or dog could change.   My lamp changed the method which it is turned on. It used to be the wheel on the power cord type. I know because I was pissed after I bought it. Now, the same lamp with the same dust on the base, has a twist type switch on the head of the lamp.   We painted our kitchen about six months ago. I went over the stove and re-caulked the crown molding, as it was badly cracked. A week ago, when it was really hot in the house, I looked up and the new caulking was just as badly cracked as the original. I was pissed. I took my daughter to ballet and when I got home (only gone a few minutes) I went to the shed to get a ladder and the caulking gun. I got back to the kitchen and the caulking was perfect. No cracks. My wife thinks I am losing it.   Still no cracks today. But I will keep watching it.   Am I traveling realities, or is my house? Or is my wife right and I'm just seeing things or my memories are messed up.
Alright, I don't who I ask about this problem because I don't want too many of my friends to know.  See, the problem I have goes back a few years. When I first got to college, this girl contacted me online. I knew the dangers of doing stuff online but I didn't really care cause I felt like I had nothing to lose and all she really wanted to do was exchange photos. I made sure to not include my face in them. But we would talk every so often, exchange a few photos, talk a little dirty, but that was pretty much it. It seemed neither of us wanted to pursue anything, which I was fine with because like I said, I had just started college.   Fast forward a few years and I am in a relationship with this girl. After a few months of dating the online girl contacted me again, we talked dirty a bit, but then my girlfriend found my phone and the conversations and it just created a whole shit show. So I stopped talking to her for a while.   Fast forward again and it has been about two years since I talked to the girl (she tried talking to me but I ignored it). I'm in a whole new relationship and we've been dating for over a year. This girl contacts me again and I don't know why but I responded. We exchanged some photos via Skype and everything; I didn't feel that great about myself but I liked the rush of doing something bad and I also enjoyed telling the girl how I wanted her to pose and everything and getting the pictures I had asked for; I don't know why but that fact alone is probably why I kept talking to this girl for so long. But now my current girlfriend [20/F] saw a conversation on Skype.   I feel like a complete ass. I keep beating myself up because I feel like I have no will power sometimes. I knew if she found out it wouldn't be good but I did it anyways. I also feel terrible because I feel like my girlfriend is going to feel insecure and definitely have some trouble trusting me now. I honestly wish I wouldn't do stuff like this; I feel like I might be addicted to this kind of activity, but I felt like I've been doing so well with not doing it and I just can't believe that I relapsed and talked to that internet girl.   I don't know what to do. I don't think there's anything I can tell my girlfriend that will make her feel better. How shitty of a person am I? Is there anyone who has ever struggled with this type of situation before? Is there anything I can do to work on myself and not do this anymore?   I want to still be with my girlfriend; I have no emotional attachment to the internet girl but I know i'm a guy so that's probably why I feel that way. I'm looking for people to say things to make myself feel better; I know I messed up. But is there anything that might explain why I do dumb stuff like this?   Sorry if this sounds like a rant. I just don't know who else to ask.
This pretty much covers it.  Legally you only need the most basic level of coverage so just about any insurer will do (the lower-end/cheaper services have crap service but will fulfill the requirement and often bill by the month rather than longer).  You can easily use one of these to buy the car/get it home.   That said, if you already have insurance on another vehicle, call your insurer.  Many have umbrella clauses that will cover another vehicle you purchase for X days before you call them to add it to you policy.
Early this year I discovered my long term partner was cheating on me. I was absolutely fucking floored; it came as a total surprise, but when I sent him packing it wasn't too long after that I realised my self-esteem had tagged along with him.   Before this happened I possessed a relatively healthy amount of self-confidence and didn't place much importance on my looks. Now I'm wondering whether I only felt that way because I was in a comfortable, long term relationship for so long. I'm done being sad and angry and ready to jump back into the sea, but because I was never given a clear reason as to why I was cheated on, it seems easy enough to blame my looks.   . . . Because my personality is awesome.   Ahem.
I've known her for 3 years, but  finally  manned up and kissed her last weekend. We were out for her friends birthday and were dancing so i turned her around and just went for it, and we ended up kissing all night. We were both drunk, so the next day she asked "what happened last night?!" I'm thinking, oh god maybe she was just drunk and it didn't mean anything, so i asked her if she remembered that and she said she did it with a ":)". Its pretty obvious she has at least some feelings for me, and she  knows  i have feelings for her, but i'm no Romeo, and I won't be seeing her on Valentines day (conflicting schedules), so i can't really tell what to do.   I just can't decide if/what i should get her for valentines day. We're not dating, but after 3 years of knowing her  i think she deserves something. I just don't want to go too overboard, but I also want her to be my valentine and let her know that i'm thinking about her.   Also, she gave up chocolate for lent so thats out of the question lol. I'd really just like to take her out or spend time with her, but she student teaches all day and i work all night, so i won't even see her! Unless i show up randomly at her school with flowers, but i'm not sure if thats too much. Suggestions?
I just figured it out!   Morello hinted, that the 4th letter of one of his abilities is an A.   Kha'zix Q : Taste Their Fear.   Kha'zix EVOLVED Q : ENLARGED CLAWS.   More hints :     Six     S     Assassin     Hide     J       All these hint to Kha'zix. Let me explain why.   Six = At level SIX, Kha'zix gets to evolve an ability.   S = September. The month Kha'zix was released.   Assassin = Kha'zix is an assassin.   Hide = Kha'zix preforms best while hiding. Due to his passive and his Q's isolation.   J = Jungle. Thats what Kha'zix is in the current meta. (This one is something im not so sure about)
My ex wife cheated on me with a college "friend" and got knocked up. I was devastated from the start because we already had two kids together so I was trying to wrap my head around living without my kids. Her "friend" freaked out and bolted, leaving her with the pregnancy to deal with on her own. She couldn't abort, due to her religion. I offered to raise the kid as my own just to keep us all together. She said she would sever ties with the "friend."   The next couple of days I coudn't get ahold of her and found out she had been spending all her time with her "friend." That is when I let go and proceeded with my end of the divorce. He ended up making an ass out of her and she asked me back several times but I stayed on track.   To this day she has been a bitter malicious mother who uses the kids against me as weapons, now that she has found a decent earning asshat to marry and support her. Looking back I am glad we didn't work it out, she is the most malevolent hosebeest I have ever encountered and she seemingly strives endlessly to punish me for our divorce (the one she enacted legally and with her actions).
One option would be to build a "primary" route from point A to point B that would would run a specific distance for each leg of the relay (ie. a full marathon). Let each runner line up to start their leg at the same time on the same day to complete the entire distance in about 4 hours. This would prevent the logistical nightmare of waiting on the previous runner to finish their leg before starting your own, as well as would give a defined start/end time to the event.   For runners who can't sign up for a leg of the primary route, allow local runners to set up local events on the same day/time.  These grassroots events could attempt to link to the primary route, or they could simply link significant areas of their local community (town hall to a state capital building, for example).   Another grassroots charity event that is successful is HelpPortrait. They set a date for photographers to give free portraits to underprivileged individuals and families each year, and support the process by providing PR kits and how-to guides on their website. Most importantly, they shift the majority of the work/logistics to the local chapters to allow people to participate without having to control every detail centrally. The cost of the central organization is offset by selling "official" merchandise via the website (t-shirts, hats, etc.)
Related Story!   Back in the day when I still lived at home, myself, my sister, and a friend of hers/ours would go down to my sister's room in the basement after our parents had gone to sleep, and we would clambake her closet.  It was big enough for all three of us to sit on the floor, so it was perfect.  At the time, we had one particular cat that loved to hang out with us while we were smoking.  One night, after we had been smoked a few bowls, the cat wanted out, so I let her out of the closet, but as she was leaving, she knocked over the bowl I had just finished packing.  My sister and friend were talking and didn't notice anything had happened until I started picking up bits of weed off the floor and repacking the bowl.  Friend asked me what I was doing, and just to mess with her I said "I found a bug on the floor, so I'm putting it in the bowl.  When you smoke a bug with your weed, it makes you even more high, almost like you're tripping."  She looked at me with huge wide eyes and said, "Really?" in that fantastic, stoned sort of way that we should all be familiar with.  I somehow managed to stay completely serious and stuck with my story for a while, but eventually I told them about the cat knocking the bowl over.  It became an inside joke between us though, and from then on, Sublime's 'Smoke Two Joints' became 'Smoke Two Bugs.'
That is just awful.   Every time you call the police mention that she is threatening suicide.  If suicide is a crime where you live then they can't ignore criminal intent.  It's complete bullshit that they won't come out to remove someone from your area seeing as it's a residence and she does not reside there.  Men are victims of stalkers and domestic violence too.  This whole situation pisses me off.  It should not matter if you're male/female, short/tall, thin/fat.  People deserve protection from emotional abuse just as much as physical.  Obviously you wouldn't notify authorities for no reason.  Why would cops jus assume people who call them are being unreasonable?  Bullshit.  It's better to go to fluff calls than to ignore possibly important ones.  Also it's not the call-takers place to judge.  They're just supposed to take information, ask pertinent questions and pass it along.   Now you excuse my wall of text if you want.  But really I don't care, sometimes they're just required.
Dearest Keto,   I, like so many of the other people on this board, am looking to start this whole Ketosis thing pretty soon and am in need of some advice. In short, I have no idea what to eat. I mean, okay, I've got ideas (I've already made a grocery list of ingredients), but I have NO IDEA how to cook. Like, seriously. I've been living off of cereal, peanut butter and honey sandwiches, and cans of chili/Chef Boyardee ever since I've been living on my own. The most I'd cook - besides a bit of baking (delicious cookies) - would be mac and cheese, maybe the occasional grilled cheese sandwich.   As I'm looking around at all the food and recipes that you guys are posting, it's kind of freaking me out. "Fry"? "Steam"? "Broil"? I do not know how to do these things. Yes, I am that retarded; for this I am utterly ashamed. Furthermore, I kind of hate cooking and would much rather have something that takes the smallest amount of time/effort to prepare. But I'm still willing to learn; I just have no idea how to go about learning such simple things that everyone already knows how to do.   Any quick-to-learn/make meal ideas, guys? I have no need for variety; I'm literally looking to eat the same things every day, as this kind of habit will help me most with maintaining a diet. I would probably need to take Dinner (and maybe Lunch too) to work, so transportability is a plus. Also, any advice on HOW to do these simple cooking things, like frying (which seems to be a staple of keto) etc.? Perhaps some good Youtube videos? I dunno.   My apologies if this is sort of a repost; I tried looking for a previous post that might be relevant, but found little that pandered to my level of stupidity. Any help you might be able to give would be greatly appreciated; I will love you forever and give you each a million dollars (before inflation) when I'm rich and famous.
So I joined a ranked game today, and as soon as the game set up one of my team member started spamming multiple phases half in German half not. however later on in the game he then started posting the remaining spawn times of purple sides red and blue buff (we where blue) which we hadn't seen bin taken, but there was a link which flowed it. Unfortunately my video of him spamming doesn't show the link as it was only on the timers, but you can see the spamming in action which got quite annoying after a while.  i'm not looking for hate against the player i just think if someone knows the website that the timers are running off riot should be more enlightened to the annoyance for players. Disclaimer: I know i witch hunt in the video xD but that was mainly cuz i was annoyed at the spamming as all i heard was clicking for 2mins straight.
Be very careful with HiddenSettings7! When you're changing folder open animations (or any settings that requires keyboard input) and you accidently exit the page with home button, the keyboard will get glitched and will not close. You won't be able to open up the page because of the overlapping keyboard and a reboot will make the menu DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY. Reinstalling or removing and installing also does not fix this problem.
I work as a systems admin at an IT firm, and [I've had rage inducing moments before]( that have interfered with my ability to do with my job, but today I followed up on a THREE MONTH OLD email migration that has yet to be completed because BAYBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.   Within the past few years, a certain email hosting platform has rapidly grown in popularity. We've done so many migrations from other email providers over to this new platform that I could retire on the amount of money our clients have spent signing up for it, and I'm only 30 years old.   One such client utilizes 2 domains (for the uninitiated, a domain is the part in an email address that comes after the @ in an email address). One was easily accessible with the documentation we had on file. The second, however, was set up by a former "computer savvy" employee that can't be reached due to nobody knowing where he moved. The domain is registered to the owner's wife, rather than the owner himself. Why? Who knows.   The domain was purchased through a large, formerly-awesome search engine/email provider/domain host, and they're notorious for being a colossal pain in the ass when it comes to helping clients access their accounts when passwords and such are lost. Long story short, we can't get into the account to change certain settings to proceed with the email migration under my companies management.   After a LOT of digging and attempts at resolving this on our own, the only option we have is to try to have the owner's wife attempt to gain access to their account since her name is the one on the account. We let her know this 3 months ago. Except, their daughter was due to have her baby around that time, and she didn't want to be stuck doing something for the business in case her daughter went into labor. Fine, I totally get that.   But god dammit, it has been 3 FUCKING MONTHS. It's not even HER GODDAMN BABY and she refuses to take even a couple hours from the little shit machine to make a goddamn phone call, likely to be told "sorry not sorry" by the outsourced fucks on the other end of the line, which would free us up to begin attempting an aggressive takeover of the domain. They are literally wasting 80% of the money they spent on the licenses for their new email because only a few employees exist on the one domain I already migrated.   At this point, I don't even care if she brings the little fucking bastard along, just GET IT THE FUCK DONE.
Basically I think there should be an option in matching making to have only over 18's. This is mainly because I think that a lot of games ruined when someone acts immaturely, e.g respond poorly to criticism/flame (no one responds well to flame but there is a differences between ignoring it and going afk or feeding).   I'm not saying all over 18's are mature and all under 18's aren't but that age is a big cut off point and you have to draw the line somewhere.   I just want a game mode where I can play with mature, relaxed people and I think many other people out there want this as well.   Of course LoL is for all ages and it's accounts don't ask for age so implementing it is unrealistic to say the least, but I would really like riot to consider this in the future.
The way I see it, a smoke-free environment is the default.  If you want to introduce variables, you must yield, and get the consent of others.  If you're at the bus-stop, ask the others if it's okay to make their clothes stink for the rest of the day.  I once had a physical, and the doctor accused me of underage smoking because everyone at my bus stop smoked.   If you're at the college, instead of smoking at the main entrance where everyone must walk through your smoke, how about moving to the smoking pavilion built just for you?  At least wait until you're the entire way out of the lobby before lighting up.   I'm not saying "There oughta be a law", in fact, I'm against laws that prevent bars and restaurants from making their own policy.  I'm saying this is basic human decency, and most smokers get outright hostile if you don't like their smoke.
Jenna" and I are both running varsity cross country this year as juniors. School just started last week for us. At a practice after school we got into an argument over some nonsense. I think she's jealous because she knows I'm faster than her. She's also always trying to intimidate me. She pushed me and I pushed back. The other girls were encouraging us and I know I should have known better but I started to pull her hair.   She kicked me really hard in the groin and I went down dead. I started crying and feeling like I was going to vomit. The coach yelled at her and she's suspended for three days but she's coming back to school tomorrow. He sat with me until my mom came to get me. By then I was okay but still really sore.   Over the last five days though Facebook is blowing up about how I'm a "guy" or a transexual because supposedly it shouldn't hurt if a "real girl" gets hit down there. People are also making fun of me because Jenna is younger and a "younger girl kicked my ass."   I feel horrible and don't know what to do. At school people are laughing at me and pointing, and on our team's Facebook page lots of trolls are making mean comments about how I'm supposedly male.   What can I do about this? I just want to die right now I'm so embarrassed. And I know when Jenna comes back she's going to make fun of me, too. I'm also afraid of her. I'm taller than her and older but she's just vicious. I'm embarrassed to be scared of her.   She blames me for the fact that she got suspended and nearly thrown off the team.   And it STILL hurts. I can't really run as well. I've been to the doctor and she says it's normal and no one feels good if they get hit where I got hit, whether they're a guy or a girl.   I just wish the kids at school understood. How do I make people understand this without coming off desperate to prove myself? I HATE how everyone is accusing me of being a guy.
This is edition #29 of a little thingy I do. I'll post 5 random facts and a short story concerning F1 or F1 drivers on Tuesdays. Some might be common knowledge to a few of you, but you might find some interesting.     Fact 1  - [2012]( had the most WDCs amongst the participating drivers with 14.     Fact 2  -  The [Honda RA300]( is the only car to have won [its debut race]( and never win another. It also led only a single lap.  I was proven wrong, the Lotus E21 also won only its debut race. Consolation randomness: [The first newspaper article about Michael Schumacher was published in 1973.](     Fact 3  - [Walter Wolf Racing]( had a former or future champion driving for them in all their races.     Fact 4  - Marco Apicella is often cited as having the shortest distance covered in his F1 career. Even Wikipedia has it! Too bad it's bullshit. Apicella reached the first turn. The  actual  holder of the dubious distinction,  Ernst Loof     Fact 5  - With [Stirling Moss]( winning the 1958 Argentine GP, Cooper became the first points scorer team and the first leader of the WCC. [Ferrari and Maserati]( were the other 2 manufacturers scoring in the first race that gave points for teams.       Story time   The flame breathing lions.   If I asked you right now what make was the car that officially won the first motor race in history, what would you say? Really, think of it for a second before continuing.   If you guessed Renault or Panhard-Levassor, then you were wrong. If you guessed de Dion, you were still wrong on a technicality, because in fact, it was [a Peugeot](  that officially won the 1894 Paris-Rouen “carriage contest”. Peugeot turned out to be a major force in the early days of grand prix racing, winning a lot with superior machines in the 19th century. Despite a weak and dire 1900’s, the 1910’s were again kind to Peugeot, largely due to legendary driver [Georges Boillot]( winning the most important races in the world including the [French Grand Prix]( After Georges’ death in WWI, his brother André held up his brother’s legacy by winning smaller races in the early 20’s, also driving Peugeots. Other than the Boillots, Jules Goux was also a Peugeot driver and famously won the [1913 Indy 500](   However, the Grand Prix world went on and left Peugeot behind for 72 years. Peugeot Sport was founded in 1981 to support the factory rally program and after 3 very successful years in sportscat racing, decided to make the jump into Formula one for the 1994 season, using  a 3.5L V10  horsepower.   The team they took up on was  McLaren   It all looked so promising with a big team, manufacturer support [and two talented drivers]( in Mika Häkkinen and Martin Brundle. But it was not to be. Despite promising pace in qualifying, in the first 2 races, 2 engines failed and no McPeugeot saw the checkered flag. Then the dreaded San Marino GP came and for the very first time, both cars finished, something which only happened 3 times during the course of the season. Due to the tragic circumstances of the weekend nobody remembers it, but [Häkkinen stood on the podium]( finishing 3rd. As apparent from this, when the Peugeots didn’t blow up and the young Finn didn’t decide that [the wall lacked a bit of McLaren]( on it, they finished near the front. In the 7 races Häkkinen finished, he scored [6 podiums]( and while a tad bit worse, Brundle also posted 2 podium finishes and other points. While no match for the factory Fords and Renaults, the Peugeot engines were on par with the Ferraris considering their pace. The reliability aspect was the problem there. [11 engine related retirements]( and 6 other powerplants blown while testing or practicing, Ron Dennis was less than satisfied.   4th in the championship with a brand new car and a first year engine manufacturer is nothing to be ashamed of, right?  Not for Ron.   “the people at Peugeot had no understanding of what it took to be successful in Formula 1” .   Peugeot was picked up by [Jordan]( for the 1995 season, an up-and-coming team with a great duo of youngsters, Eddie Irvine and Rubens Barrrichello. Peugeot management stated they’ve sorted out all the reliability problems and will elevate Jordan into championship contention.   Again, it was not to be. However, Jordan had some good results throughout the year, including [a double podium]( in Canada and several other points finishes. Despite “all the problems sorted out”, they still suffered 6 engine failures over the course of the season, but it was considerable improvement. Only 9 points behind McLaren with worse chassis, it again seemed like Peugeot is on the right track. Or were they?   Having reworked the engine for 1996, it was finally one of the more reliable ones. Only 2 blown units, on par with the best engines, but now they lacked the outright power, compared to the aforementioned top engines. [No podiums]( is not what a manufacturer wants, whatever the other results are. Most often, the executives prefer to see a few great results that they think they can build on.   Even though 1997 was [relatively successful]( with new Jordan signings [Fisichella]( and [Ralf Schumacher]( Peugeot wanted out. They were blaming Jordan for the lack of car development and Jordan and as the contract was ending, they wanted to shift full focus back to rallying. Problem was, the dealers liked F1 and thought they can win. And thus in came the worst man who could have come in in such situation. One Frenchman who had a say in motorsports, a large following not just in France but all over the world and most importantly, a F1 team. Of course, this man was [Alain Prost](   So [the French dreamteam]( was on for 1998. The dream turned out to be [a nightmare]( though. The fully reworked engine was weak, unreliable and heavy, the team was mismanaged and the gearboxes also loved to shred themselves into pieces. Even though Panis and Trulli are a pretty solid driver pairing, it is nothing if they are driving [an X-winged car down on power]( for the first half of the race and spending the second half in the garage. Only the chaotic Belgian GP saved Prost from the total catastrophe, but [one point]( means nothing to a team that aimed for podiums.   1999 was much better. Instead of absolute, utter shit, they were  just  shit. A few points here and there, with relative reliability, only to be thwarted by lack of pace on most tracks. Due to another chaotic race, now on the Nürburgring, Trulli again survived carnage and [finished runner-up]( But with [engine development]( stopped near the end of the season the team saw [4 blown powerplants]( in just as many races.   1998 looked horrible… [But then came 2000]( I could write another thousand words on that season, but I don’t think I need to. Everybody knows it as one of the absolute worst seasons for any team in recent memory. Only [6 blown engines]( but [ 18  mechanical failures]( plus 5 more crashes, [one famously involving both drivers]( And then there was the total lack of pace for most races. With no bright point in the season at all, Alesi even retired in Monaco from a position that could have resulted in a 2nd place finish.   After this debacle there was no reason to stay. Peugeot was the car manufacturer with the most starts without a win by this point, even more than what Yamaha had, despite twice their budget.   So why did this disaster happen? Probably the attitude. They won everything by outspending the competition before F1, but in F1 they needed top notch management, commitment and a winning team. And patience. No strikes and napping during the summer, no Tuesdays off, no we will get them next year…   At the end, Ron was right about it. All those years, [Ron was right.](   The engines found later use in small teams, purchased by and badged as [Asiatech]( They were relatively well-prepared and the results tell it all. The 2001 Arrows was more competitive than Prost in 1998 and 2000 and [Minardi in 2002]( outscored both.
I didn't get mandatory registration. The gist of the article is that several highly regarded child psychology professionals, including Dr Phil - haha, think that threatening your child with no longer loving them by emotionally withdrawing when they behave badly or against your wishes is a good way to make kids behave well.   They're wrong, in my opinion, it might work for a few times, perhaps a year or two. Eventually the kid will get used to the fact you're a shallow prick whose love is conditional and stop caring when you emotionally withdraw. It also makes them less likely to come forward if they do something really bad because they know they're risking their emotional support network.
Another thing to think about....how are the speakers mounted? For something like this, they should be up high and above the crowd. Humans are great absorbers of sound.   If you do NOT have stands that can  safely  raise the speakers this high -  do not attempt to do so  I have some stands similar to  this . Remember - you'll be putting significant weight above people's heads.   The last event I did with these we took over from another company. I was told that they had around a dozen speakers and still were almost unintelligible. I did the event with four 15's and everyone complimented us on how they were able to hear if everywhere.
I got a loan approval through my bank at $160,000.00, saw a house on the market at $169,900.00 and basically after weeks of searching, decided this would be the house for me. My realtor and I figured we could get it with an offer of $160,000.00 because it had been on the market at the list price with no offers for nearly two months.   The seller's agent called my loan officer attempting to get me approved for higher so they could try to still sell it to me, but at list price. My realtor isn't budging and neither is my loan officer, so at this point is there anything I could do to sway the seller's mind on selling higher?
But I have a lot of things to do so I could play tomorrow.   Muzzy
Hello everyone, I recently graduated from pedagogy and got my first job. As an educator I strongly believe that ICTs are strong tools to enhance and improve the inclusion of students in schools, as everyone is a different world (in terms of learning) and in my new job there are plenty of students with special needs.   As a result of that, I want to create some apps that can help me to make this process of inclusion faster and easier for them. Also, I want to raise the participation of parents and integration of them into the learning process of their little kids, as teachers-schools-parents-students have to work together in order to achieve what I want. To make this practice real I believe I have to learn how to develop Android apps, as I do not know anything about it and creating an useful app for my school and my own researching purposes would make many things easier.   Finally, could you recommend me where I can learn to create apps? Or where can I make a free course of app develop?
Reddit, I did what I thought I was unable to do have genuine feelings for a girl. We go and have lunch, txt, and have called each other for the past month. Last week we went out on on a hike and here is where she asked if I would show up at her birthday party. Being attracted to her and crushing hard on this girl I replied what any man would do, I said I'd be there. When I arrived, she ask me not to leave her side and gave me a big hug. She introduced me to her friends, to my surprise, all of them were guys. When I saw she didn't have a drink I pulled her aside and asked if she would like one. She followed me to the bar. As I am receiving the drinks from the bar her best friend (guy) pulls her over and they start to slow dance. I think nothing of it as she assured me that this is her best friend. I have both drinks in my hand as I see her sharing a kiss that later leads to a full on make out session. Keep in mind I have yet to kiss her as I planned on doing later that night if she wasn't too drunk. Reddit I could have kissed her that night but I felt our first kiss would be cheapened by her being under the influence of alcohol. I am right now heart broken and she has texted me a total of five times. Three of which read as "I'm so sorry," "You haven't replied," and the last one reading "Are you mad at me?" Reddit I'm just heartbroken not mad. I don't feel like speaking to her but I wanted to ask the Reddit community how I should respond. I have yet to reply.
I was bitten by a whiteface monkey, there was a few that would hang around my house and they were always very friendly and would climb on you and whatnot. One day a wild pig was running around the house and my dog got a little over excited chasing it around and the monkey must have freaked out because it gave my leg a big old bear hug and bit me on my knee. Wasn't that bad.
says   I've [23/f] Been involved said woman [21/f] for almost 3 months now. By the third week of us seeing each other we both acknowledged that there were too many conflicts between us. Since she didn't speak up, I was upfront and told her that this wasn't going anywhere. Partying was fun, but I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship with her. I suggested that we could be friends or hook-up sometimes if she wants. She got mad and called me "insecure", but agreed to a FWB deal.   My biggest problem with her is that she's very passive-aggressive. If there's a problem she'll abruptly stop talking to me, not respond to calls/texts, then come back hours and even DAYS later saying that 'her phone was on silent' or similar. Drives me nuts and I've told her more than once that's it's disrespectful and a downright childish way to act.   Her biggest problem with me is sex. She says sex with me is awful and boring. That I'm horrible at it, never get her off, and it's always about pleasing me. * Truth is I'm fairly easy to please, know exactly what I want and how I want it. Doesn't take me long to get off and even though I have my own little fetishes, I don't need a whole lot. Ever.   Meanwhile she's into BDSM, takes a looooong time to get off, and needs me to do all kinds of things: spank her, clamp her nips, flog her, etc. It's not like I haven't tried, but the last time we were in bed and she wanted me do this laundry list of stuff for hours on end, I literally fell asleep during sex. Drool and everything. Some spanking and fooling around is fun, but after a while I get bored and frustrated. She calls this me being "uptight" and "repressed" about my sexuality.   Last argument we had, she said I'm "disgustingly narcissistic and possessive" and she doesn't want to be in a monogamous relationship with me because I treat women like objects. Also that I never show her affection, never made her feel special, haven't tried to sweep her off her feet, and (really interesting)  I don't deserve monogamy . Again, I remind her that: we're not a couple, I'm not interested in a relationship with her, and she's free to go her way instead of wasting her time trying to make me better at sex, or whatever it is she's aiming to do! She once again circumvents the reminder and talks about my insecurity. I don't even know what she wants from me.
After 8 years at the same company I am starting a new job next month.  I have pretty much everything squared away and a plan... except for my 401k.  I've worked for 2 companies throughout my career, the first I simply rolled over my 401k to the company I've been at the last 8 years (balance was small enough to not worry).  I have maxed out my 401k the last 3 years and have worked up a nice balance.   I've been struggling with what to do with my 401k now that I'm leaving and would really like the advice of this group.  From what I read I have 4 options.     Keep it with current employer. 2. Transfer to new employer 3. Transfer to IRA 4. Withdraw the balance.     4) is not even a consideration of mine because of the penalties and taxes.   Once I get to the job and see the investment options and associated fees I'll be able to make a more informed decision about 1, 2, or 3.   However, here's my struggle.  I'm a pretty risk adverse guy, and never really considered having multiple retirement accounts.  Now that I'm going to a new job, I now realize this is a high likelihood throughout my career.   I like to 'see' all my retirement in 1 place, however I guess that is not likely.  If I chose option 2) won't I lose the benefit of dollar cost averaging over the last 8 years? If I chose 1) then dollar cost averaging remains but I start a new 401k at my new company and the power of compounding is lost.  I have 1 account at my old company...and a new account at my new company starting at $0. I'd really appreciate the advice from this group and learn from others experience/thoughts.   I should mention, to date, investment has been in an end date fund. At my new employer, I cannot contribute to 401k until after 90 days.
This is the greatest advice for anyone on keto.   I started at 255 lbs, and I'm down to 195 (24 M).  I wish I had before pictures because I look in the mirror and fail to see any difference in my body most days.  The only thing that really convinces me I've lost any fat/clothes sizes is dropping from an XL shirt to an M.
On Vayne you can max either. I feel like maxing W is more effective because I will be getting attack speed items first.   Maxing Q first is effective if you want to     Trade a lot/more evenly     Tumble a lot (reduced CD with levels)     Be invisible more when you ult.       I usually prefer maxing W because I feel like I'm always against a Leona/Thresh and having more true damage allows me to DPS them more effectively because supports are so incredibly tanky right now.
Nanobots are exceptionally susceptible to heat, regardless of what they are made out of! Their size makes it impossible to beat them to death - you could smash a few thousand nanobots on an anvil with a hammer all day and not hurt them. You could soak them in water and they'll just carry on. And, if the designer wasn't dumb, you can probably let them fly around with EMPs going off all over and they'll be happy as anything.   But heat, heat requires surface area to dissipate. It doesn't go away, it spreads out. Since a nanobot is so small, it doesn't handle heat very well at all. You might need something a little warmer than a flamethrower, but we have sufficient methods of burning things to handle a nanobot swarm.
How do I move on or at least deal with this? We have both agreed that we are not actively seeking other people at the moment. And that if we do, its not because were trying to replace each other. I'm trying to trust her to make good decisions, but the thoughts of other guys are killing me. We we're dating for a year and a half. We are going to the same school.
I started graduate school in August of this year and have met many new people in my class. The first weekend after orientation, we all went to the bars together and socialized. Well, I connected with said girl and everything seemed to be going great. It has been about three weeks of texting, hanging out, and going on dates. It really has been going well. She is the nicest person I have had the chance of dating.   The second weekend we went out together, she starts talking about her old, abusive boyfriend. She told me she was abused verbally and he seemed to really cut her down every chance he got, all the while cheating on her several times. He really seems like a genuine asshole. I hate that she had to deal with that because she is such a sweet girl, but like many abusive relationships that I have read about, she stayed because she felt like she needed him/deserved him and his treatment.   I respect that she is piecing her life back together and trying to get her self esteem. She is too nice to be treated like that. Here is where the problems are starting to arise. She is comparing things that I do to him. All my classmates and I have the same schedule. We all go to every class together. She gets upset when I do not sit with her in our classes. She says that I do not pay enough attention to her and that the ex did the same thing. Now that school is getting more demanding, I have not communicated as much as I did earlier in the semester. She says that her ex did the same thing. Every time that I do that she does not like, she compares me to an abusive asshole which is upsetting and really makes me ill. I treat her with the respect that every person deserves and try to do sweet things for her, but at the end of the day, I do something to upset her. It probably does not help that I am a very sarcastic and joking (thanks reddit) person.   The most alarming thing that has happened occurred this weekend. We had sex for the first time, and after she came she starts hyperventilating and crying. She is asking me if I am going to leave her. The sex was great up until that moment. I assured her I am not using her for sex. The sex ends there and we go out. Nothing else was said about it.   I am very confused on how to handle the situation. She is not a virgin, but the ex was her first and only and really left a big scar on her. I like her because she is genuinely nice, but the comparing to the old boyfriend is getting old. He still texts her apparently. I do not know if she responds, but surely she does because he texts her a lot. She swears she is not going back to him and that is good enough for me. I just do not know if she is ready or able to be in a relationship right now.
Same for me. There's too much discomfort involved in relationships with people from significantly higher socioeconomic classes. Why would I want to deal with all those tensions?   My high school best friend told me about how she and her new gf went one weekend to a dealership and test-drove a Porsche. Meanwhile, I'm wondering who the fuck does that. It was a long-distance friendship, so luckily I never had to actually go shopping with her when she bought her hundred-dollar tops. And I wouldn't know how to act anyway in the places she and her family frequent. And I'd feel bad even making myself tea at her place, because she apparently buys ridic expensive tea. Christ.   This casual acquaintance of mine, with rich parents, bought me a ~$150 ticket for this activity we both wanted to do. We had decided to wait until I saved enough from my job. It's been awkward for months because I can't reciprocate financially and I don't want to reciprocate in other ways. Fuckin' annoying mentality... if you make the strings attached invisible, I'm just going to assume they aren't there. Fuck that shit.   I'd rather be friends with and date people at my socioeconomic level, because we're not going to be discussing what countries to tour via train during our next trip abroad or test-driving a Porsche for kicks. And we could relate about issues like juggling work and school and everything else. And saving money. And stressing about money. And actually having pressure on you to become independent from your family at some point.   And I get that someone who has the resources to travel and live in the lap of luxury would want to be with someone equally able to participate and be comfortable in that world.
I've tried many different techniques and followed all of her ideas and direction, but she can never seem to get there.
Has anyone figured out how to increase their light lvl yet? I know some people have gotten the "new" kellhunter's class item, but that requires a treasure key and now the only way to get treasure keys are from PoE.  Also I have seen some higher armor blue class items, possibly from engrams? Thoughts?   EDIT: I think I was unclear in my OP. I am pretty sure it is obvious to most that "equipping better gear will increase light lvl". What I meant to say is pre-expansion has anyone figured out some ways to increase their light level, and how did they? Does it max at 170? Has anyone a higher light lvl than that or seen/played with someone higher that 170?
It was a normal monday afternoon, I had just taken a late lunch and was sitting down to complete the reports I had been working on previously. I sat down positioned my keyboard and mouse put my on my glasses, grabbed my pen and leaned back. My body pressed into the supple worn leather and sank into the soft moulded foam, Normal it seemed at first, until suddenly the base of my chair let out a mind numbing, soul crushing creak, a creak to end all creaks and I felt it, I knew it, I was a complete goner. Time slowed, sound lulled, my pen flew out of my hand as my arms flew out in an attempt to stabilize my decent to darkness. I swung my head to the office door and exclaimed; 'tell my family I love them!'. In a final attempt to save myself I launched my legs up and slammed them into the underside of my desk, it was futile, the depths had started to swallow and pull me to my demise, pens, desk lamps, telephones, trinkets and doodads flew everywhere. It was at that point I closed my eyes in an attempt to detach myself from what was inescapable. For what seemed minutes later I made contact with the floor, a safe heaven it seemed like, I opened my eyes and saw salvation, the candy bar I had lost weeks ago, and in the end it was all worth it."
First of all,  we have been together for eight months. We moved in three months ago.  Everything about our relationship is alright.  She had a four year old daughter from her past which I don't mind and I have said and still say that I will value her as mine because she's a part of my girlfriend.  We both had good jobs,  but I got cut from mine so my pay every month went down by almost $1200. We've had to actually learn how to budget and save money.  Just recently our account switched into the negative territory for the first time ever.  It's back up,  but that's never happened before.  She comes from a pretty good lifestyle, parents making a lot of money and her always buying whatever she wants.  I have always struggled and I come from a family of twelve so not getting the small luxuries of life is nothing out of the norm for me.   I love living with her but I don't like how she insist on me cutting of helping my family pay off credit cards that we got as a family.  She also came to me crying that she hates struggling and that she wasn't use to it.  Rent is hefty so I don't know what to do...  Any advice would help.
Woe is me. :(   Benefits They're Real! was such a perfect mascara for my lashes. From my mother, I got the typical Asian heritage; short, thin and sparse lashes that is weighed down by most wet mascaras. They're Real! was dry enough for them to perk up, plus the brush was absolutely amazingballs. I bought it in Amsterdam, as I can't get Benefit in Norway.   After two weeks of usage, I saw a correlation with the sudden conjunctivitis (pink eye) I got. It started after I started using the mascara, and got better when I didn't use it (still vacation, so I'm not using makeup every day; just to feel a bit purty when at home). I used it yesterday, and by the end of the day, my eye was throbbing, completely red, swollen, runny and it felt like blinking with glass in my eye, due to the tiny "cysts" I got. It had initially gotten better (on the days I WASN'T using it).   Never ever had this reaction to eyemakeup before, and I've used ALOT of mascaras in my makeup-life time.   It wasn't conjunctivitis, as I thought, rather allergic conjunctivitis. I'm stopping all usage of this mascara, might keep that amazing brush for usage with another mascara though.   Are there any lash-sisters that can recommend a mascara? I've heard Clump Crusher was pretty good, any lash-sistahs from anotha mistah liking it?
Travis: long time fan. One of my favorite quotes of yours was when you were ~15 with a broken back and trying to see how "fast your wheelchair could go".  -old dirt bike movie from my racing days.   Anyways to the nitty gritty, Lyn-z put up a Facebook post asking about who will be seeing the Nitro Circus 3D movie on opening day... I replied with a request for y'all to babysit, no reply. It's my son's 8th birthday tomorrow and we're renting out a wake boarding park for a few hours, then I wouldn't mind taking him and my wife to the new movie. My other son is almost 2 and pretty awesome, I'm sure it will be good exposure to possible future endeavors for you two.
My School IT technician was actually decent, he blocked all of the websites he needed to block and all that, but he accidentally left one computer in the school with CMD accessible. We have 250+ computer and I found that one, he blocked CMD on that computer after I wiped the whole network.   He kinda got me stuck until I started learning a bit more, and discovered he hadn't password locked the system BIOS. I tried overclocking the "internal system core" as the BIOS put it. Now a few of them wont start up and I know how to fix them but he doesn't realise what went wrong. My technician upgraded the whole set of computers for the school when he started and we all got better computers, that came with windows seven, which he, for some reason, downgraded to XP (I understand, it was a stable build). I realised that with an unlocked BIOS Menu I can just get the computer to boot straight off a USB I own with a Windows 8 Iso on it and install that. I plan to do as many as I can with some mates and a shitload of USB's on Muckup day. My parting gift to the school ;)
I saw an internship I'm really interested in and I made some changes to my resume so it would look a little better. I'm looking for some advice on how to write my resume for this internship.   The internship is for a financial firm that helps turnaround failing businesses; they are looking for someone part-time to help with preparation of financial presentations, business plans, plus graphs and charts. Also they are looking for students who have training and insight in the financial performance of companies.   I don't have a lot of experience and I'm not trained or have insight in the financial performance of companies. I do have some skills and achievements which I decided to put in front of experience and education on my resume to grab the employer's attention. Do you think that's a good move or does it make me seem like a show-off, since I don't have much experience and I'm still a college student?   I would love to hear from more experienced and successful people in business/ finance but anyone who feels they have good advice please share!   I would appreciate advice on primarily resume/hiring but interview and other professional advice is welcome too.
I'll try to keep it short. I've always wanted to play metal gear solid but I've never had the means of doing so. The metal gear solid HD collection starts with MGS 2. Will I be missing out if i don't play MGS 1? Would reading the story on Wikipedia suffice?
This is getting to be a bit ridiculous.   At the beginning of the summer I told a guy, lets call him Xi, that I go to college with that he was more than welcome to move in with me for the summer and the next school year. Before he moved in I laid out the rules, pretty basic set, pay your bills on time, pick after yourself, if you have friends over make sure they aren't obnoxious, don't have your friends live here and so on.   Leading up to the summer at the end of the last semester I was talking to people in my research group since both Xi and myself are in the same research program on campus, and the general consensus was, "Cmucky, don't do it, you will regret that decision, he is insanely messy and never cleans up after himself in the lab."  Mind you this was coming from everyone else in the group, 8 fucking people saying the same thing. I personally never really noticed it because I would always come in and do my lab work in the middle of the night when no one else was around so I wouldn't be bothered and could focus and all the machines were open for use. Anyways, I said forget it and let him move in.   Since he has moved in it has been nothing short on a complete nightmare. I have always been a super clean person, super anal, everything has its spot and so on. He is the polar opposite. He is dirty, as in he showers once or twice a week. Cooking is the worst. If you haven't picked up from his name, he 100% Chinese. Now I have zero problem with ethnicity but while cooking it becomes a huge issue. All of his traditional dishes he makes are full of oils and soy sauces and he spills them everywhere! I have walked into the kitchen a few times and almost eaten shit because of the oil on the floor. Recently my landlord provided me with a new fridge and stove that are less than 6 months old each. Both of those are now completely destroyed. The fridge has so much shit in the bottom of it that has been spilled it is disgusting/ The stove top is the worst. The burner elements are covered in burnt food, the stainless dishes that sit below the elements are charred and stained to the point of disrepair. The stove top is stained as well completely ruined, as I have yet to find a cleaner that will actually remove the shit that is stuck on there.   There is fucking rice everywhere in the kitchen, noodles cover the floor and the garbage, unless I take it out is always overflowing with rotten food because he has no idea of compost even though I have told him numerous times. His dishes litter the little space we have for counter top and stove top. To begin I allowed him to use my pots and pans which I quickly found out was a fucking a mistake as he used them as cutting boards and destroyed the lining in every single one of them. Spatulas have been melted, a stove top element has been left on numerous times for hours on end only for me to come home after work and see that they are red fucking hot for the last 4 hours!   The apartment now stinks of soy sauce chinese style food along with his repulsive odor from lack of shower and and the musk of his diet. One corner of the living room is littered with cardboard boxes from all the shit he orders offline since he has his parents credit card and everyday is like christmas since I feel like santa clause having to bring his fucking packages too him because he is too lazy to answer the fucking door.   At nights when I come from work and I want to sit down and cook a nice meal for myself I often get discouraged because my nights usually involve picking up after him and cleaning the kitchen daily since he has yet to ever clean it in the 2 months he has been here.   The best part thus far though. For roughly the past 2 weeks he has been having his friend stay here. At first I thought he was only spending the night one or two nights a week. I slowly picked up that he has been here for nearly two weeks. I know this because his car is always parked outside the apartment complex, every single fucking night along with the fact I can constantly hear 2 voices coming from his room. Now if he would have been here once or twice a week or had asked me about staying here I would have been absolutely fine with that fact. What pisses me off is that he felt the need to go behind my back and let him live here completely free or charge and then fucking lie when questioned about it.   I have always though of myself as nice person. I do my best to help people out when I can and this guy is no different. Xi needed a place to stay because he wasn't sure if he would be here both semesters and didn't want to sign anything because of that fact. I told him he could live with me, pay half the bills and his wouldn't need to sign anything because its only year leases where I rent and if he is going to be here for only a semester, what sense does it make for him to sign a year lease? That way he doesn't need to find a subleaser if he were to leave. I mean I am trying to help this guy out as much as I can and so far I have been getting fucked! This last month he was barely on time for the bills and was actually late on 2 of them, which would have affected me since they are in my name but thankfully I am such a nice guy and covered for him until he paid me back.  Lately he has been bugging me about signing the lease to which I tell him absolutely not because I don't want to get stuck with him.   I by no means needed a roommate, the extra bedroom just had my computer in it for studying and some weight lifting shit for some light exercising. Now I feel like I have no control over the place in which I call my home. I have talked to him numerous times about picking up after himself and not being such a lazy fucker or inviting his friend over to live here for 2 weeks so far for nothing. I hate the fact that then lied to me when I asked about his friend. Motherfucker, do you think I am retarded? I know where that guy use to live! And his car is here every fucking night! And meanwhile you have to gall to look at me and tell me that its not my right to place rules on your room and what you can and cant do in this apartment?! YOU AREN'T EVEN ON THE FUCKING LEASE YOU SHIT HEAD!   I told him earlier tonight that his friend had to kick rocks for awhile which landed on deaf ears as usual since his car was in the parking lot when I ran to get some milk. I honestly think that within the next week or so unless he gets his shit together I am kicking his ass out.
Okay, while I do in fact own Pokemon Y, I'd like to win this game for a friend. I've known this guy since the 6th grade, and we're now in 2nd year university. For the longest time he was my pokemon buddy. Lately, due to school fees and medical fees, he hasn't had the money to buy the new games, and has been super bummed out because he hasn't been able to play with our group of friends. I'd like to win this game, to give it to him for christmas. I want him to finally be able to join in the fun finally, and I want him to finally get caught up in the new generations. I already have my old 3DS I was going to give.

There’s a lot more about the Nanjing Massacre that the world might not know about.  I went on a tour with a charity to get some testimonials from survivors regarding the atrocities that the Japanese government was responsible for.  I heard about things from human experiments to burying evidence of toxic weapons that later went on to affect the lives of villagers that accidentally dug them up during construction.   One topic that definitely hit home for me was the sexual slavery and “Comfort Women” stories that I heard throughout my travel.  This didn’t just happen in China, but all over Asia.  The testimonials I heard were haunting, and each survivor has her own horrific tale about the horrendous acts that were forced upon them.  The pain didn’t stop for these survivors of the war when they managed to make it home, as many were shamed and disowned from their families.  Sex can have an incredibly negative connotation in Asia, and the shame that is associated with it led to some truly terrible situations for these traumatized women.  They haven’t received an apology from the Japanese government nor any reimbursement.  The money isn’t necessarily the point, as many of the women are now in their 80’s and 90’s and have no use for it.  However, the apology would reaffirm their stories, and most importantly, the world could learn from the mistakes of the past rather than hiding everything under the rug.  The one thing that was common amongst all the testimonials I heard was the fact that they wanted the world to learn from the mistakes that happened during these horrid times.   My friend has actually been making a documentary about the Comfort Women for the past few years, and I have had the privilege to see the strength of these incredible women.  Some of the amazing things I have I have been lucky to be a part of is a weekly protest that happens in Seoul, Korea outside of the Japanese embassy.   They have a dedicated place in Korea for survivors of the Comfort Women system called The House of Sharing, and they not only take care of the grandmothers, but every week since 1992, they have been protesting outside of the Japanese embassy demanding an apology.  In 2011, the 1000th protest took place, and different cities around the world protested (I was able to attend the one in Ottawa, Canada).  However, every year, I hear that some of these grandmothers have passed away, and the fact that they do without an apology really hits home.   The voices of many seem like they are falling on deaf ears, and the silence is maddening.   If any of you guys are interested, the film that my friend is working on is called “Within Ever Woman”, and details can be found at www.wewoman.org.  She’s in the process of post production, and has gotten a lot of support from many communities in the world, but issues like these can always use more support.
Everyday I feel like I'm wasting time by being a little bitch for not talking to girls or trying to be a confident person. I'm so socially awkward, can't think of anything fun to talk about, can't figure out how to click with people. Seriously all I'm doing now is working hard in school and can't even use my knowledge to show off to people. Wtf do I need to do? I don't want to end up in my mid 20s with 2 friends.
Warframe, the game we all love and hate (bloody RNGesus), is very much a game about damage. Elemental damage was revamped in Damage 2.0, and in the ensuing confusion a great deal of effort was taken to understand and more importantly explain the aspects of elemental damage. Unfortunately, the same level of education about critical hits has not been done, which is a shame considering how many of the current high tier weapons are critical hit based. Let’s start a wall of text!   Critical hits have a chance to occur each time a bullet hits an enemy. When a critical hit occurs, the damage that would be dealt is multiplied by a critical damage multiplier. The chance for a critical hit to occur and the amount the damage is multiplied by is based off the innate stats of the weapon. You can see these stats in the arsenal on the “Critical” line, where the notation is as follows: (Multiplier)x|(Chance)%.   The critical chance is pretty straightforward, if 25% is listed, each bullet has a 25% chance to crit. Damage multiplier is about the same, each bullet’s damage will get multiplied. This includes the physical and the elemental components of the damage. There is however one, totally awesome, ninjatastic feature of crits that isn’t well documented.   When a critical hit occurs on a headshot (or a battery back shot, if you’re fighting moa), the critical damage multiplier gets applied again. Applied, not added. So a 3x multiplier would multiply the damage again, resulting in a total 9x crit damage multiplier. Don’t forget the headshot bonus, which is an extra 2x, for a total of  18x damage for critting on a headshot . Wow! How can I get more of that?   Obviously, we’re going to use mods, but we’ll need to also check which weapon we’re using as well. Crit Chance from mods multiplies rather than adds the weapon’s base crit chance. For example, a max rank Point Strike mod with 150% extra crit chance would multiply a weapon’s crit chance by (1+1.5=2.5) times. Applied to a Grakata’s base Crit chance of 25%, we end up with a 62.5% crit chance. Applied to a Miter’s base Crit Chance of 0%, we end up with a whopping 0%. The same logic applies to Crit Multipliers, the larger the base Crit Multiplier, the more you gain from modding for crit damage. So, what are our breakpoints for which weapons to mod for crit damage?   First, here’s a breakdown of how far we can change our values, the minimum base we’d need to hit 50% crit chance. (Note: I really don’t think using two mods for a single crit stat is worth it when you could be boosting up the base damage and the second mod usually includes a drawback, but I’m including it if you really want to go all out on the crits):   Weapon Type | 1 Mod Crit Chance | 2 Mod Crit Chance | 1 Mod Crit Damage |2 Mod Crit Damage |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| Pistol | 2.2x->23% | N/A | 1.6x | 2.2x Rifle | 2.5x->20% | 2.98x->17% | 2.2x | 2.8x Shotgun | 1.9x->26% | N/A | 1.6x  | N/A Melee | 1.6->31% | N/A | 1.9x | N/A   Some weapons of note to consider: The bows, the Soma, and the Synapse are all capable of achieving 75% crit chance with just Point Strike, while the Paris Prime, Dread, and Synapse can all go over 100% with Point Strike. The Latron Prime and the Soma get mentions for having 2.5x and 3x base multipliers. The Weapon types aside from the rifles/bows don’t seem to have comparable numbers to these mentions, though there are some solid picks among them.   But wait a moment! You said some of the weapons could go over 100% crit chance! Does that mean I crit twice? Unfortunately, no. Going over 100% crit chance does nothing to benefit you and just wastes mod space. So, if you’re going to really min max a dread, you’ll want an unmaxed point strike rather than a maxed one.   Our last stop will be to talk about the nightmare and corrupted crit mods:     Hammer Shot     A decent mod, my only problem is that you’re getting only an extra 60% crit damage compared to vital strike’s whopping 120% bonus. Remember, we still need to have some slots boosting the base damage prior to the critical hits. I’d consider looking at it for a status proc build rather than a crit build.     Critical Delay     The extra 48% allows for more reliable headshot nukes on the guns that aren’t already crit monsters. I’d pair this with Shred to reduce the penalty and grab some punch through, or use it with a weapon where a slower rate of fire would make the gun more comfortable to use. If you grab this, play the sniping role, eliminate high priority targets with the headshots you built for, and leave the mob clearing for the people with the  p-p-p-p-pew-pew.     Hollow Point     Unfortunately, this one’s for the pistols. The damage decrease isn’t so bad when you consider a full ranked Hornet Strike gives +220% damage, compared to this mod’s -15% damage. To really take advantage of this you’ll want a pistol with good crit chance and a fair amount of accuracy.
I'm making this post in response to Nightslut3's video on [Forg1ven bandwagon]( I figured that if he can use his content creating skills to put up other redditors for scrutiny then he is vulnerable to the same criticism. I'm not writing this because I am salty but his video has gotten me a decent amount of people to PM me and insult me and even one guy telling me to go kill myself. If I can achieve anything with writing this is that I want at least one person to be aware that they should use critical thinking skills before believing content submitted to this subreddit.   In terms of the video, I was denigrated for 2 reasons:  the "after" comment was  taken out of context  terrible attitude/reputation in solo queue.   If you put yourself in a position of scrutiny, you should be able to take fair criticism where due but I do not stand for people intentionally taking comments out of context so it makes their content look better. The other thing I don't stand for is nitpicking specific examples that skew someone's stance so your content can get more views. What Nightslut3 forgot to mention in his video is that I have comments praising Forg1ven's skill way before he joined SK. Here are the comments I was talking about:   Again, my goal isn't to redeem myself, it's so that people understand the importance of critical thinking. The comment section of that video is hypocritical/ironic as well because people there are literally jumping the bandwagon for hating people who jump in the bandwagon.
12 man standard league. If Alshon does end up playing, he plays hurt. I'm thinking it might be better to put in Andrew Hawkins against a not so good NO Def. Any thoughts?
Last night I had my first edible and wow was I in for a surprise. I have been smoking for about 2 years now and I tried these Bhang chocolates. While I was blazed out of my mind, I had personal realizations about my life. (I.e. social anxiety, my priorities, etc.) And soon I knocked out haha. But starting from today I feel like I'm starting my life with a new perspective in mind.
I did this a few days ago with a few friends... At first it was just two of us, I had fast hands, my friend didn't, we kept getting 5/6 bags before it blew up. After a few attempts another friend joined (also no fast hands), kept getting 5/6 (actually made it harder imo), after he swapped to fast hands build, we did it first or second try.   Also, when running to the bus, throw a grenade in, blows all the windows, making it easier to get bags out. We had two people throwing out the door (one either side) and one person throwing out the opposite side window, he managed to get 3 (with fast hands), guessing because he didn't have to turn to throw bags out.
I just got invaded for the first time ever while I was in 1-4, by a guy who was probably a higher soul level than me judging by his better equipment and the fact that he could roll around in a full set of armour. Anyway, I quickly retreated away from enemies into an open space where we could fight, and an epic duel commenced. A laggy internet connection didn't help, but we managed. The problem was, I had literally hundreds of decent grasses, and he seemed to have a pretty good supply as well. Every minute or so when one of us had been hit a few times, we would simply do a couple of backward rolls and munch a grass, bringing us back to full health. I eventually won when he rolled the wrong way and I unleashed a flurry of hits that he couldn't survive, but it took a good 10 minutes and a dozen or so grasses each before that happened.
2 major problems with that approach though.   First, check out your electoral map. Odds are fairly high that you live in a state that's already so far decided, it doesn't matter a flying shit what you vote.   Second, votes are not qualitative. A vote for is never interpreted as "Well, he must have thought the other guy was worse." But rather, 100% of the time, your vote is read as "This voter is behind me 100%. He agrees with all of my platforms, and I should continue thusly."   An increase in 3rd party votes not only increases their recognition among media and voters, but it tells the leading parties, win or lose, that "Hey. I'm losing support for these other positions. If I hope to maintain power, I should probably find out what needs to change."
If you got shit on you,  would you a)was it off with something or b) wipe it with dry paper and call it good?  In iraq I experienced using a hose to blast my ass with water and most people thought I was weird for doing it but aside from hygiene,  spraying cold water all over yourself when its 120 outside is amazingly refreshing.  Now squaring over a hole in the ground admittedly was rather strange.
Hi. I'm independent and live alone.  I'm into anime, computers, and games.  I'm shy.  I work out a few times a week.
sigh, mistress of pain will attempt to heal you since it deal damage. Because you had auchenai on the field, the health that you would have gained from mistress was turned into damage. The game then reads that the damage dealt to yourself was dealt by the mistress of pain, because of her effect. Then because mistress of pain dealt damage to you, she then tries and heals you again, resulting in more damage.
Feels like eternity but I've finally made it. I put "Juice Fast" in quotes because I kind of cheated. My work schedule is horrible so my typical intake was about 1L - 1.2L of juice before work and only about 400mL or so when I got home. The thing is sometimes it would just be too late at night and I didn't want to awake my roommate with my loud ass Breville so I would eat an Apple, which I did numerous times.   Anyways, the results are awesome and I feel pretty fantastic. I've dropped nearly 32lbs and have great energy and focus throughout the day. I've also seemed to curb my addiction to caffeine, which is one of the main issues I wanted to alleviate by doing the fast. I'm thinking more and more of just doing another 30 days just because of how truly   great I feel. The only hard days have been when I go to the gym. I just crave proteins and get insanely hungry after a workout. fwiw I'm a 27 year old 6'4" male. Weight before fast: 249lbs
TW: SUICIDE]   [This comment] ( on an [AskReddit thread]( was brought my attention by /u/nightshadequeen who criticised the top comment on this thread asking men what they'd carry in their purses if they owned one but I couldn't help but notice the overwhelming amount of crap flowing forth from this guy's initial  totally funny ™ joke:   > A gun so I can shoot myself for carrying a purse.   For a small second I thought someone would call them out on a post that both jokes about suicide, trivialising the pain of thousands, and it propagates the traditional gender roles that exclaim it to be 'girly' for a man to carry a purse ( MRAs  why aren't you attacking this, oh wait, sperm jacking). Can I also say that it's mocking trans* peoples, almost as if its telling them to kill themselves for acting in any way that 'betrays' their sex. At the very least other users could question the direct avoiding of this threads topic, thus removing discussion but of course no one complains until much further down and the highest upvoted comment actually continues the joke, with a little racism thrown in as well:   >[ there is so much more to life. Who cares that everyone makes fun of you for your purse? You are a strong confident black man!]( [+501]   Further mocking of suicide and trivialising depressed peoples situation. How nice. But surely reddit wouldn't overlook the unnessary racism? No, of course they wouldn't, in fact they'd run with it,  "yes and..."  and all that:   >[Woah, how did you know he was black?]( [+118]   >>[He had a gun man.]( [+648]   Because we know blacks are constantly violent, especially against whites, now where's my list of biased and misleading statistics to back this up. And I'm sorry to say it doesn't stop there. After some 'ironic' jokes referencing our favourites  Family Guy  and  South Park  this magnificent piece of coprolite is unearthed:   > You guys are missing what is most important in a real nigga's purse, fried chicken.   And with it the flood gates opened (but he said n*gga not n*gger that means it's not racist /s):   >[I felt so dirty upvoting them all. But I couldn't stop. Much like a black man with watermelon.]( [+2]   It must have been so hard for him to upvote, I'm sure he really struggled with his moral compass as he posted that racist reply too.   >[Watermelon?]( [+1] >>[ Some water melon. Maybe water melon cool aid. ]( [+1] >>>[Kool-Aid* But all the homies know it's Koo-Layed]( [+1] >>>>[ My real nigga rank just decreased by 6 :( ]( [+1]   And then he posted about wandering into a KKK meeting and being killed, real high class /r/n*ggers stuff right there.   >[I have actually seen a black woman pull a piece of fried chicken from her purse, before.]( [+2] >>[ I know, I wasn't lying! ]( [+1]   See, anecdotes. My racial prejudices  must  be true.   >[Don't forget about that purple drank and watamelon]( [+1] >>[ naw son get dat tervus so u dont have tuh carry it round wicha be smart dawg ]( [+1]     Of course consider  their  username is  /u/jerrytheman1998  it's safe to assume he's 15.   >[I think this might well be the most low effort string of comments I've ever seen.]( [+65]   At last, some reason for a second I thoug-   >[Nah, low effort is a  black man's  forte.]( [+4] >>[ word ]( [+3]   So close...   Anyway, so sorry, got distracted by the raging racism there for a moment and I forgot the main theme of this post was gender roles. Back to it.   From here on out it's mostly people calling him out on his comment and his insecurities, but sometimes it's offensive in itself and the replies were just as bad so let's just speed through them and we can be on with our lives:   >[Maybe you could carry your insecurities in there.]( [+113]   First replied with:   >[He said purse, not a freight car.]( [+64]     But then a return from OP:   >[ right near my lipstick and butt plugs. ]( [-8]   "HAHA GET IT BECAUSE IF YOU ACT LIKE A GIRL YOU'D PUT ON MAKEUP OR BE GAY! THESE ARE THE JOKES! SO VERY VERY WITTY! BECAUSE MAKEUP IS FOR GIRLS! HAHA WOMEN SCARE ME AND GAY PEOPLE MAKE ME INSECURE!"  Well at least he's being downvoted now (too little too late).   >[Some lube, so you can go fuck yourself before you shoot yourself as well.]( [+88]   See, I'm not sure how I feel about this. Right intentions just about too much of a try hard, edgy feel to me. Speaking of edgy, OP's back, and he's getting upvoted again:   >[ Yes, I just happen to still have the leftover lube I used on your dad. ]( [+62]   Have I already posted this one, I don't care, I'm doing it again:     ^^^^^^We ^^^^^^need ^^^^^^more ^^^^^^edgy ^^^^^^smilies ^^^^^^people   >[Gender roles anyone?]( [+23] >>[Yes, gender roles exist and when you flout them you will be looked at strangely.]( [+4]     >>[They exist.]( >>>[Yes they exist, and they're socially constructed and we should do away with them, as they're harmful to everyone.]( [-2] >>>>[That's an opinion to be considered, for sure.]( [+3]   "But I won't, because I'm already settled in my ways here and don't wish to exceed my mental capacity for mental thought"   >>[You can't wipe a person's perception of environment clean.](   >>[Don't be rash.]( [+1]   CHANGE IS IMPOSSIBLE GUISE!   And to scrape the bottom of the shit filled barrel we get the "THIS" and "I CAME HERE TO SAY THAT" commenters. You know, those incapable of original thought.   >[Came to this thread expecting to see "gun" - was not disappointed.]( [+2]   To be it would be surprising to see reddit act with rational, inoffensive manner, don't know about disappointing though   >[I was going to say the only thing a man needs to carry in his purse is his vagina. I'm glad I didn't say that, though, because it's insulting.]( [-4]   But you managed to slip it in anyway, well done.   >[I literally thought this exact comment, in these exact words, before I walked in.]( [-5]    Shitty minds think alike
Two things up front:     Schizoaffective disorder has similarities with schizophrenia, but they are different.   Neither means MPD/DID/plurality     Some links:             I started out diagnosed with severe (suicidal) depression (which I'd had as far as I could remember, intermingled with relatively brief hypomanic episodes), which was updated to bipolar when I had a semester-long hypomanic period, which was again updated to schizoaffective disorder when I started having hallucinations without being manic/hypomanic.   I actually started having hallucinations when I was a child. (There was a Spanish conquistador who stood next to my dresser at night - he didn't do anything, he just stood there.) When I was a teenager, I started seeing people as having wings of varying sizes. So some people were capable of flight and others not. A few people had had their wings torn off, and some didn't have them to begin with. Senior year my depression hit a new low, and I started hallucinating people as being dead. That was not fun...   The hallucinations stopped when I went to college, and I had a rare semester without hypomania or depression. Second semester I was hypomanic - I was outgoing, everything was jiving, I was excelling at my school work better than I ever had with 18 credits (full load) and 6+ extra curricular clubs. Over the summer I absolutely crashed; the next semester was bad enough that I dropped  two  classes and sought out a therapist. I forgot about the hallucinations and the hypomania until it happened again - the depression completely shot my memory. I had to keep sticky notes posted all over my room about things I had to do, and I would forget whether I had done assignments and had to constantly check with professors to see whether I had turned stuff in or not.   That spring I started meds, which appeared to help, but I was probably just having a normal period, because fall semester I crashed again. I wanted to die, and the dead-people hallucinations were far worse than they'd been in high school.   I took the next semester off and eventually found medication that worked. I stabalized, and have remained stable since then.
just saw this comment and wanted to get back to you on it. First off, I paid waaaaaaaaaaaay less than what the v6 should have really costed. Honestly, even after all my mods, I'm still a couple grand shy from its true MSRP. The other thing is, I actually enjoy building my car. The way I saw it, I bought a blank canvas, that I just now started painting. I'm planning on doing an engine swap later down the road, but overall, in the end, I will have a fully custom challenger that will have the power (or more) of a SRT8 for less $$$... And the best part is... I will never confuse my car with someone elses Now sure people will bitch about resale value, and being a poser etc... I really don't care about that. This is my car and will always be  my car  I have no plans to ever sell it. So yea.. Thats my reasoning.
Coulrophobia is the fear of clowns. Now, ever since I was a small child, I have not liked clowns whatsoever. Something about them gave me a super uncomfortable and "off" feeling. I'd like to say that my fear of the was passed down from my mother, who can't stand clowns either. However, it had always been mostly without reason. Until one night nearing Halloween. It is last year, a few weeks before the the holiday, and the yearly hay ride/corn maze/haunted house of spooks opens up in our neighbourhood. I had gone the previous year with some friends, and been scared to death. Naturally, I couldn't wait for this years' event to roll around.  I invited a different friend this time around, whom we will call Anne, and both of us were understandably excited to see what was to come as we pulled into the driveway. We could already see the actors dressed as the monsters that haunted our nightmares roaming around and it was only 10pm. Our ride didn't start until 10:30pm. Of course, we know that underneath the masks, makeup, and blood that there are real people, but when they're limping up to you, whispering gibberish into your ear, and stroking your hair in the dead of night.... It gets pretty terrifying. I had learned from my previous year at this event that the more scared you looked and reacted, the more these critters would stick around. I managed to perfect my act of an unfazed face ,and when they really wouldn't leave me alone, asking for a selfie. That usually made them wander away. Anne and I had our fair share of spooks, and our hay ride was fun and memorable, and it was midnight when our hay ride was finally over.  After the ride, Anne and I made our way back to the parking lot and called our dads' to come and pick us up. My dad said they were about half an hour away, but that our tickets came with a free hot chocolate, so we should go redeem that while we waited. We weren't exactly sure where the hot chocolate kiosk was, but Anne noticed a lady sitting beside a velvet rope that led to the entrance of the corn maze.  "Hi there," I said to her, "do you know where we can get the hot chocolate?"  "I believe it is over there," the lady said, pointing in the general direction of the haunted house, "but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the man behind you can help you find it?" and then a clawed hand rested itself on my shoulder.  My friend and I turned to see something out of my nightmares. A tall, blood covered clown, with a smile curling up his face. Image the clown from It, but about a hundred times worse. Looking up at it, I froze. I was unable to react. I stopped breathing, blinking, and moving all together. Not a sound came out of me. Anne, however, made an audible gasp, which made the clowns' attention turn to her. I was not thinking or rationalizing at this point, and I was feeling completely helpless at this point, but with the clowns' attention averted, I saw this as the moment that I could escape. I ducked under the velvet rope and jogged about 15 paces away from the clown and Anne. I turned around to see the clown watching me, and Anne chuckling, knowing that clowns were a large fear of mine. To my utter horror, the clown scissor-kicked over the velvet rope and began taking large strides towards me. My entire body went into panic mode. It may seem kind of overboard now, but in that moment of my life, I would have rather thrown myself head-first into the concrete and died rather then have that creature of nightmares come within an arms length of me again. So, it was now or never. The clown was between me and the long driveway that lead to the road. I decided I was going to make a large u-turn and run as fast as I could towards the entrance. With every ounce of energy I had, plus the adrenaline now pumping through my veins, I hoofed it as fast as I could for the street. In all my years of PE, I had never come close to running as fast as I did that night, and I probably never will. I passed the clown, and my eyes were fixed on the road ahead of me. It meant freedom and safety. After running for a bit, I looked over the shoulder to see the distance I had put between it and myself. To my utter horror, the demon clown from hell was now running at full force after me. Fear overtook me. Sure, I was running fast, but that thing was TALL. It could probably catch up to me within a couple strides. I couldn't help it, and a scream slipped out of me. I pushed myself to run faster then I already was... I was nearing the street... Just a few more steps and I would make it... And then I heard it. **"SAMAAAAANTHAAAAA"** That's right. In the roughest, deepest voice you can imagine, it called out my name. After it came a comical, overdone laugh that sent shivers down my spine, and still does to this day. I could feel tears brimming, and I glanced over my shoulder once more. Shockingly enough, the clown had stopped, and was standing directly beside my friend Anne, head cocked, and was watching me run for dear life. I did not stop though. I continued to run and I made it to the street. I had a plan to run to the nearby McDonalds and hide, while calling for help. I decided to look over my shoulder one final time before continuing my run to the nearest fast-food restaurant, and I then realized that the clown was now no where to be seen. Anne was standing alone, doubled over, laughing at a hyena. My situation seemed less then amusing to me. However, with a keen eye looking for any movement or signs of the clown returning, I pulled myself together and made my way back to Anne. She couldn't speak at all, this was so amusing to her. It became evident that my friend had ratted me out, and told my name to the clown. I was not amused. We managed to track down the hot chocolate, and our dad's arrived ten minutes later. They, too, found this story extremely hilarious, and laughed in my face. When I got home and told my mom, she just hugged me, and said she was so sorry I had to go through that. I guess only people afraid of clowns can truly understand. Clown, lets not meet (again). *
Like the title states. I went to get my teeth cleaned, and ended up with them piling up that I "need" "deep cleaning" and how I've got gum disease, and that I've cavities, and my 3 wisdom teeth need to come out (had 1 out). They ended up giving me a 4K bill estimate!   I didn't even have a teeth cleaning done!   I came to get my teeth cleaned, my insurance knows that that's what I came in for, paid for a  teeth cleaning  (yey being covered for that) and yet, I got  no teeth cleaned  all I got was poked and prodded and slapped with a 4K bill!   Anyone heard it costing over 2K for a deep cleaning of teeth?! And that's  with  insurance covering things!   Over a thousand for removing wisdom teeth (which aren't bothering me at all) while knowing that I don't take well to opiates as painkillers (ether allergic to the blend, or get blackouts in which my character takes a 180 change and I've no memory of anything, complete amnesia) and the fact that I might be allergic to morphine.   And in the range of a thousand for cavities & fillings.   What. The. Fuck.   I'm looking into finding a new dentist, I read the reviews of my dental office and they all say that it's overpriced crap. Yelp grading is a 2/5.   Gonna be a bitch finding a dentist that takes my insurance and is good and doesn't charge bullshit fees.   I still want my teeth cleaned! I've been told  by the dentist  that it's a waste of time and $ to do a regular dental cleaning. So my insurance paid for me to sit in the chair and have a 4K bill thrown at me (4K with insurance coverage) because it makes sense not to clean my teeth when I came to have them cleaned, right?!   AGH.
Eating well+exercising everyday helps a LOT.   There's a guy that my grandma went to high school that lives down by the beach near where I work on Saturdays and Mondays. He's in his 90's and is in even better shape than I am (I'm 23 and pretty fit), and he's ALWAYS going for 15-20 mile walks when he stops to talk to me. He's in his 90's but looks like he's in his 50's, and he's still super agile and up-beat. It's crazy! He's the most down to earth, nice, outgoing, smartest, funniest, and awesome person I've ever met.   One time I asked him for tips on how to age so well and he told me it's actually super easy, but most people don't do it for some reason; eat healthy, lots of exercise (specifically cardio), and by doing things you love and surrounding yourself with things and people that make you happy. He said he lives his life stress-free and he focuses on the positive things rather than the negatives, even in bad and unfavorable situations.   I think my favorite quote from him has been:   "You get back what you put out. If you put in the effort towards living a truly happy life, I mean...REALLY put in the effort and dedication, then you'll have a great time, man. I promise. In a few years I'll hit the big 100; I am honored and excited, and I have appreciated and loved every second of it, the good and the not-so good, I'm just so glad I've lived this long and have been able to experience so many wonderful things. You're what, in you're 20's? You still have so much life to live and I hope you pay attention to the things I tell you so that you can enjoy your life as much as I have. Follow your dreams and don't let anything bring you down. Just keep on keepin' on, brotha."

I've been stable at 3.1k mmr for the last year, and I don't I feel like I outplay my opponents or make better decisions than them anymore. When I win, I win thanks to either incredible effort on my part (focus/devotion/comfort hero) or I just get carried by team mates. I feel bad because I very rarely effect my games in a positive (re: game winning) way. BUT I like that the skill level feels in most games very even. I don't often get stomped in ranked, the games are just lost in normal dota losses, either better team comp or a lost fight at a critical juncture. I like the games, but I feel bad because a lot of my team mates are better players than me and realistically they are still climbing. I prefer carrying and I feel like I rarely play as a let-down, but I know I'm not playing well enough to carry the entire game, and at best I can contribute in team fights and do my job as a hero. So yeah, thoughts?
My GF and I live together, been dating for 3 years and we have had our ups and downs. The last year and a half has been rough so we decided to go to therapy. Things have gotten better in the sense that we don't argue as much but I feel it's too little too late. My GF is a great girl, she's caring and loving and is truly in love with me which is why this is so hard. She hasn't really done anything wrong to warrant me breaking up with her but I feel that she just isn't the one for me. I feel that we are two different people at heart and things will only get worse if we were to get married or have kids. We are opposites with different outlooks on life and different interests. While she is a great person, I just don't feel we are fully compatible. If we were just casually dating, things would be fine but I don't feel we are right for each other to get married too. She also has an extremely low libido and sex has always been few and far between. That doesn't help either. I've thought about this for many months and I just know deep down that I have to break this off. I guess what I'm asking for is advice, encouragement, support. I've never done something like this and I feel very guilty because I know it will crush her. I care about her and it will be hard to see her hurt. Does anyone have any experience with this? Thanks for the help.
It's very rare for me to find a game where me or one of my teammates on Ana is told to switch to Lucio or Mercy, even if they're playing fine.   Ana is really strong in the right hands, unless the Ana player on your team is literally only shooting enemies and never ulting, leave them alone. It's quickplay, that's where you're supposed to try out new picks. In competitive I can understand wanting a more reliable healer like Mercy or Lucio, but flaming people for their picks in quickplay is just stupid, and I most often see it for Ana.   Example: I was walking from spawn on Nepal and hadn't pressed any button other than W walking to the point and the Zarya on my team just said "ana switch to lucio please"   I ignored it and kept playing, until my first death after 2k healing and a point saving ult, he went at it again with "ana please switch to lucio its painful".   I was playing. Fine.   Not only that, but the team was generally getting crushed, as some quickplay games are, and no support can save the entire team, so a switch would make zero difference.
I'll compare the Finger Trap to the AK12 Wrecker, as they're both guns designed for the purpose of hipfiring. The Wrecker gets a penalty to accuracy in return for better hipfire. It has more recoil and worse hipfire than the Finger Trap, so without attachments it's definitely a worse gun.   Laser sight makes it better than the Finger Trap at hipfiring. So at that point, it's a contest between the Finger Trap's +1 class slot and lower recoil against the Wrecker's better hipfire accuracy and freedom to choose more attachments. The accuracy is low on all AK's, so the recoil still isn't particularly bad, but it's noticeable.   If you use a second attachment slot on the Wrecker for a foregrip, it makes the recoil the same as on the Finger Trap. This makes it a contest between the Finger Trap's +2 class slots against the Wrecker's superior hipfire and option to add a 3rd attachment for 2 class slots with primary gunfighter.   There's lots of options for the additional attachment. It'd also be possible to not use a foregrip and accept the higher recoil. This would make it a contest between the Finger Trap's +4 class slots against the Wrecker being better at everything (except recoil if you don't use a foregrip).   What it comes down to is: how useful are the extra class slots you'll have from using the Finger Trap? Do you want a secondary weapon? Lots of perks? Multiple exo abilities/launchers? Lots of scorestreaks? I personally favor weapon attachments and normally have 3, I pick my essential perks, then everything else is a bonus. So, I'd probably prefer the Wrecker if I wanted an AK that hipfires.   It's also worth noting that no matter how good the AK's hipspread is, it still fires slower than all the SMG's and is a 4-shot kill. It's still better at long range than at close range. The Finger Trap and Wrecker are still long range guns, just with close range bonuses.   The HBRa3 Bear Fist and Bal-27 Inferno have the same hipspread stats as the AK12 Wrecker. So, a lot of this applies to them too. The Wrecker, the Bear Fist, and the Inferno are the only assault rifles that can be better than the Finger Trap at hipfiring, and they need the laser sight to do it. The difference between the Bear Fist and the Inferno and the AK's is that they are 3-shot kill close up, but have more recoil so are worse at long range. The Inferno also has a fire rate increase so is even better at close range.   Since this is a thread about the Bear Fist, I'll just comment on how much better the Inferno is than the Bear Fist. They have the same hipspreads, so that's a tie. The Inferno has a higher fire rate, in return for a slower ADS time. The Bear Fist has a free red dot sight, in return for less accuracy and a shorter 4-shot kill range. If we're comparing these guns with the idea that we'll be doing a lot of hipfiring, then the longer ADS time isn't as much of a disadvantage. Without quickdraw, the Inferno takes 0.075 seconds longer to ADS. With quickdraw, it's half of that. It IS a disadvantage, but the advantages are worth it. The Inferno fires faster and has less recoil, but its 3-shot and 4-shot kill ranges are both shorter than the Bear Fist's (but that's true with all Bal vs HBR examples except the Obsidian Steed). Despite the range drawbacks, it still has better TTK stats at all ranges, more than enough to compensate for the longer ADS time. The only other factor is the Bear Fist's free red dot sight. If you want red dot sight, then that's a nice +1 class slot bonus. If you don't, then it's a hindrance. I normally don't use optical attachments with assault rifles, even with the HBR's obstructive ironsights, but even if I did, I'd still prefer the Inferno just for being a better gun.
Lets say someone goes abroad for vacation and spends two months there. During those two months, is he a traveller to that place or is he considered a resident?
UPDATED] Hello guys!   I was about to start training at canfis for marks just then I thought I should record the number of times I fall and the number of marks I get at each level hoping that I would contribute to 07rswikia since I use it extensively. So here it goes!   First of all this course is seriously terrible in terms of efficient leveling so don't come here right after 40 if you're not interested in marks because you will get around 12-14k xp at early levels like 40-51 due to falling alot.   As shown in the [NEW]( screenshot you fall 21 times after doing 3 levels;41,42,43. "5-40" means I got 5 marks from 40-41.   "4-41" means I got 4 marks from 41-42.   "6-42" means I got 6 marks from 42-43.   The ratio of marks and times fallen is 15:21   Okay so now starts my big shit luck the picture was taken 2 days back when i thought osbuddy will erase everything in its notepad upon closing so I better take a screenshot just in case. After seeing that osbuddy doesnot erases anything from notepad I got eased up and thought I no need to screenshot or copy paste into Windows notepad for backup.  After 2 days,which means today right now I had recorded stats up to 57 agility(Im 58) and was calculating the average marks,doing maths stuff about agility it was a little hard to see the numbers so I highlighted all the text by holding the cursor across all text to make the text a little more prominent. I'm bad at maths so i was very slowly and carefully doing the calculations this took enough time for the game to logout me and take me back to login screen. Seeing the log screen i.......typed my password WHICH replaced ALLLL WORK OF 2 DAYS with my password on the osbuddy notepad. Haha hahahaha hahahaha haha hahahaha hahahahahaha!!!!!! FML... I seriously wanted to throw my laptop STRAIGHT OUTTA WINDOW but predicting the future after that I calm down.   It was quite a long list but since I manually write it myself I remember some key moments which are described below: ∆I had fallen 51 times with getting 51 marks. Equal ratio so far   ∆I had gotten 100 marks after falling 94 times. Not bad ratio   ∆I had gotten 120 marks after completing a century in falling. The marks ratio will keep winning now!   ∆I had gotten 246 marks after falling 151mth time I had 14 marks from 1-40 agility hence that's why i got grace (246+14=260)   **After the "6-42"  If I remember correctly it was like this   6-43   8-44   5-45   8-46   11-47(this one is confirmed I remember it clearly because I fell 3 times in a row)   8-48   9-49** And it keeps increasing and you won't get less them 10 marks from 50 on.   "The "∆" are confirmed and I remember them exactly. I think the reason I remember them might be because I wrote them in osbuddy notepad like "W00t 51 marks n 51fell as well"  Nevertheless the data in "**" can be wrong because I don't exactly remember those figures.   So here you hope I helped. Below are some of my observations from doing agility: You fall more when you're both hands are full(a 2h sword), you fall slightly less when your one hand is free(like aching), you fall slightly little when both you're hands are free.  Again this is only my personal observation. You fall slightly lesser when your weight is zero or in negatives(for example try boots of lightness)   I got my graceful in 3 days,no pet for me and have a good day :)
I started by using the Pimsleur method. Halfway through volume II, I realised that I was ready to move on, so I tried books/ online resources, only to hit a bump.   I could not figure out the verbs, or manipulation of preposition/prefixes (still have trouble with this). At that point, I said fuck it and enrolled at the local Russian embassy for a course which basically prepared me for the O level in russian (in which I got a C) in 6 months. I now have a basic understanding of the grammar, but still only understand 40% of what is spoken/written, since my course focused heavily on covering most of the grammar rather than vocab. My conversations tend to be bilingual - with russians using russian, and me responding partially english sort of "ya igrayu novaya game".   Russian is my 7th language attempt. I put Japanese (#6) on hold because man, it's piss easy compared to Russian - the only issue is remembering that damn kanji. It's well worth learning Russian though, it's one of the upcoming strong economies, it's immensely rich (lots of beautiful literature that loses part of its essence when translated), and .. frankly, I'm finding it to be sometimes even better suited to expressing myself than English. There's plenty of interesting stuff on the internet which is solely in Russian, including academic resources.   Interestingly enough, you might notice some russian influence in other languages, such as Finnish.
I want to dye my hair like in the picture, and am looking for advice on how to get the best effect.   My hair right now is a dark brown, almost black, naturally. I haven't dyed it in a few months, but have previously dyed it red, black, and bleached it a few times. However, every time I bleached it, I had professional help. This time I will be doing it on my own. Any advice will appreciated!
Well, this comes in handy most of the time when you have to loot a body and be quick, or are in a crappy situation and need to pick something up quick. Since there are significantly less slots in pants/jackets than most backpacks, so you would have to drag a maximum of 12 items into your backpack versus a whole body's worth. So even then the whole drag-n-drop procedure is much quicker.   Equally, while passively looting, the drag-n-drop procedure is much easier to keep organized.
In addition, there is a less-studied reverse gateway theory that earlier regular cannabis use predicts later tobacco initiation and/or nicotine dependence in those who did not use tobacco before. One Australian study[38] appears to have found such a correlation. However, they admittedly could not rule out the fact that cannabis is commonly (in many countries, including Australia and most of Europe) mixed with tobacco in joints to enhance burning and/or stretch supplies. Additionally, though not mentioned in the study, blunts (tobacco-leaf cigars filled with cannabis) are commonly used by some subcultures in the United States as well, despite tobacco-mixed joints being relatively uncommon there. Such "traditions," as opposed to cannabis per se, could plausibly act as a "Trojan horse" for developing a nicotine habit.[39]
Okay, technically old information, but ones that have been ignored/forgotten coming back into light. Here's why I think the man in the iron mask is the REAL Jay Garrick (now mind you this treads into the Jay/Hunter twin theory so it might sound a bit farfetched but hear me out nonetheless!).   Towards the beginning of Season 2 when we were revealed what Zoom's intentions were. We saw Jay's Flash and Hunter's Zoom duking it out on top of a building a la this picture right here:   [Real Jay Garrick](   Now in this picture Zoom did not know about the multi-verse yet! But when he found out there were more speedsters than on just his earth, he went out to rule the world as the only speedster alive (meaning he had intentions of killing other speedsters). Now much later into the season we find out that the Jay the group all knew was a time remnant of Hunter Zolomon, one he was designed to kill. But in the picture, what reason would Zoom have to fight his current Time Remnant? Case in point, it was the real Jay he was fighting, before he takes him to his  evil lair   My theory states that between the singularity forming and the group meeting Jay (hunter zolomon). The real Jay Garrick was taken by Zoom before going back through the time line to find his time remnant.   Why do I think this?   Here we have a video of    [Jay Garrick](  Calling out Professor Wells for creating all the metas. This was before the singularity formed. So it seems to me that this was the real Jay that the group has not yet met, because why would Zoom call out Professor Wells for something that saved his life.
I'm in 4th year Aero-Mechanical Engineering.  There's going to be a LOT of stuff you don't understand first time round.  It takes work, that's why it's a hard degree, and you generally go on to get a good well paid job.   Youtube has helped me a lot over the years.  With maths, physics, dynamics, structures etc.  It's basically like having a lecture, but you can play it as many times as you want.  And they explain it better than words on a page. (Just don't use it as an excuse to skip lectures).   There is always a handful of 'lads' in engineering.  They arrive late, talk loudly and announce their grades to everyone.  Who cares?  This early stuff might come easy to them, but next year there's going to be a class you understand better.
I will by all means, since you asked so nicely.   Growing up, I always hit it off more easily with girls and had very few male friends to speak of. Late in college I met Rodney, and after an awkward start we realized we were meant to be friends for life. Unlike me, he was very popular on campus, and thanks to the communal showers, he developed a reputation for being very well-endowed ("Rodney, with a Rod down to his knee," as they used to say). There could've been worse rumors, I guess. With my South Texas upbringing, I would never be so scandalous as to discuss another man's genitals. Maybe it helped to harden our friendship. Noticing that I wasn't so social, he introduced me to Cheryl, and after a few years of dating her I popped the question and we got engaged.   Cheryl is my dream girl, and I'm all the more fortunate that she got along so well with Rodney. She loved his sense of humor, and he's an incredible imitator, able to do spot-on impressions of television personalities. He would regularly leave obscene voicemails for friends in the voices of Sesame Street and Looney Tunes characters. Really dirty and thus funny stuff. You haven't lived until you've had Elmo call up asking you to service his little red pocket rocket. But I digress.   Wedding season for us was the summer, and seeing that I had no siblings and no other close friends, Rodney fulfilled his Best Man duty by throwing me a bachelor party by himself. He knew I was uncomfortable around any woman other than Cheryl at this point, so ixnay on the strippers and greenlight on skating in the park! No joke, there's nothing I enjoyed more than roller-skating in the thick humidity of the South, the air whipping past my face and speedracing with pals...though I had only one. Rodney was happy to oblige, so a week before the wedding we filled a cooler with beers, grabbed our skates and hit the pavement.   Rodney made the arrangements, telling Cheryl we would be gone all day and would be getting messy from a full day of fun. He found a paved neighborhood on the other side of town that was under construction and thus not populated yet, basically a skatepark all to ourselves. We arrived dressed in our body-hugging, moisture-wicking athletic gear, sat on the curb to strap up our skates and cracked open a few beers. With the buzz we were both feeling we had to struggle a little to get to standing positions, and we charted out our routes. "Let's start off slow, get warmed up," Rodney advised, and he pointed to the end of the street as our destination. "Let's race to the corner and back a few times." Rodney looked amazing when he played sports, everyone would admit that, but as emasculating as roller-skating can be he managed to look even more fit and graceful. He was no match for my speed, though.   A few trips back and forth, and we were starting to work up a sweat. "Do you regret not getting a stripper yet?" Rodney asked at about the 5th lap. We both laughed, and I skated backwards to make eye contact with him. "Not at all, I wouldn't have this any other way!"   "Maybe I can make help you have it both ways," he said, and mockingly slipped off his shirt, seductively like a stripper. I whistled jokingly, shouting, "Take it off!" You could always expect to have a good time with someone as kind and playful as my Best Man. By the time we were finishing our 6th lap, we had a good sweat going. Summers in Texas are no joke. "Y'know, with the wedding coming up next weekend, you wouldn't want to have tan lines on your wedding night. What do you say to 'skinny-skating'?" Rodney suggested, always so thoughtful, putting me first. "That's a great idea, I want to look my best for Cheryl," I eagerly agreed.   We both stopped, slipped out of our outfits and let the sun drench our glistening bodies. I tried to keep my eyes away from what appeared to be Rodney's third leg, stealing sideways glances at his huge member which, while not "down to his knees" as reputed, was definitely large enough to get people talking. I kept eye contact with him--on his face, I know what you're thinking, you naughty reader--and challenged him. "Ok, real race this time. The last one to the corner and back has to suck the other person's dick!" We could barely contain our laughter. "Just kidding, for real though, the loser has to buy dinner!" Rodney quickly agreed, and we stood at our marks.   We counted down, and took off in a blur. The empty beer cans flashing in the sunlight reminded me that the mutual buzz we were feeling would probably be giving me an even greater advantage than usual.  Looks like a free dinner is in store for me , I thought. But somehow Rodney was right on my tail, and I had trouble shaking him. "What the hell, I didn't know you could skate like this!" I shouted back at him.   Rodney didn't slow down at all. I could feel him almost catching at my heels. Then he pulled a dirty move. "Lookss like ssomeonesss gonna be sssucking ssome dick," he shouted in a real faggoty, lispy Elmo voice. Drunk, out of breath, and sweating, we both got the crazy giggles. And you know what happens when guys get the giggles: they start to lose their balance. I don't quite remember how it happened as the beers may have given me a bit of amnesia. But as I got lost in laughter I felt Rodney right at my back, and I fell backward, right onto his lap, taking him down with me.   You can imagine that it's not fun to fall on your ass on hot concrete. More awkward for me was falling in a manner that somehow let Rodney's curiously erect meat skewer fully penetrate my evenly-tanned chocolate starfish. We were both immediately embarrassed, I think, but we still couldn't stop laughing at our hilarious situation. Two straight guys, skating naked, sweating and out of breath, sitting on each other outdoors. I have to stifle a chuckle now just thinking about it. I struggled drunkenly to stand up, but it's hard to get up when you're wearing skates and have a dick up your ass. I only managed to bounce up and down a few times, apologizing repeatedly, and I felt terrible 10 minutes later when Rodney grunted and ejaculated deep into my colon. How humiliating! "I'm so sorry, lemme help you clean up," whispered Rodney. What a gentleman, my Best Man. A true friend indeed. He leaned me forward off his dick and cleaned me up with his tongue.   So, that's how I was accidentally penetrated by my best friend. Cheryl and I had a huge laugh about it afterwards, and she loves to bring the story up at parties, just to embarrass me. Gotta love her. Anyhow, I'm straight and have been happily married for 4 years.
Inb4 Hands that Thieve   But yeah, I don't really keep track of this stuff beyond what I hear about, and I don't hear about much. Out of the last three albums I was aware of from bands I care about (Hi-Five Soup!, Candy Coated Fury, and The Hands that Thieve)(yes, I'm far enough behind that I consider Hi-Five Soup! recent), one was ehhhh, one was kinda terrible, and one wasn't ska. I know there's gotta be good ska around now, cause I listen to [this guy]( But I never hear it, mostly due to my own negligence. So
For the most part, this subreddit is fine. I love watching the great plays on ToO, and the reactions to rare exotic drops. But if bungie didnt listen to its community as often as it did, this game would be better off. People would get to experience the difficulty of the game as it was ment to be instead of complaining to the point of nerf. Bungie should do what they want their game. They'll nerf stuff as they see fit and buff stuff with the same logic. If I were bungie this games challenges would have a lot more reward as well as difficulty. We've all seen TTK trailer, with the titan on mercury. I would have that subclass be a reward for going 9-0 in ToO. As well as the other subclasses would have their own challenge.
Lou likes to wait to make major changes, such as firing the head coach, until he feels he has to pull the trigger. When he pulled the trigger on firing MacLean it was around Christmas. This year when we get to the Christmas break we will have played 36 games, almost 50% of the season. So let's see what our possibilities are:     Dec 4 @ Toronto   Dec 6 v. Washington   Dec 8 @ Carolina   Dec 9 v. Chicago   Dec 11 @ Philadelphia   Dec 13 @ Dallas   Dec 15 @ New York Islanders   Dec 17 v. Ottawa   Dec 19 v. Tampa Bay   Dec 20 v. Washington   Dec 23 v. Carolina     The games in  italics  are against conference opponents who we are going to be fighting with for a wildcard spot. The games in  bold  are against division opponents who we are going to be fighting with for any playoff spot.   There are six games in this stretch which are going to be vital for our playoff hopes. They are the two games against Washington, the two games against Carolina, and the two games against Ontario opponents (Toronto & Ottawa).   The reason for this is simple. We're in direct competition with those teams for playoff spots and have a golden opportunity to get a big swing in our favor. Win those five games and our playoff chances improve. Lose those five games and they drop off drastically.   The other five games present a very important 10 points on the table, but we don't have to win all of them. Losses to Chicago and Dallas are manageable because a) those are good teams and b) they don't help anyone else fighting with us for a playoff spot. A loss to the Islanders or the Lightning similarly isn't too big of a hit because we're not reasonably competing with them for a spot either. The last game on the list is against Philadelphia. The Flyers are a goddamn tire fire right now. You think we need to make a change? You really need to look at how bad Philly is if you think things are bad here. This game is a must-win if only because of how embarrassing it would be to lose.   So that's 11 games and I consider 7 of them must-wins. If the Devils can deliver on that, and go 7-4-0 between now and Christmas they'll go into the break with a 16-16-4 record for 36 points in 36 games (.500). To put it in perspective, when John MacLean was fired the team had a 9-22-2 record for 20 points in 33 games (.303).   Now, if the Devils drop half of those key games and lose to Philly and end up 4-7-0 instead, they'll have a 13-19-4 record for 30 points in 36 games (.417) and I think we'll be further out of a playoff spot with more teams between us. At that point I think Lou would pull the trigger on a change to try to rebound in the second half.
In my experience red light doesn't go away with a better ISP. I'm not sure if the severity of red light "lag" changes much either.   I can tell you that there is a bit of a glitch between the client side crosshair and the server side crosshair. Normally there is lag between the two, but in particular, when peeking around a corner to fire, the serverside crosshair loves to follow the wall as you peek. Ok maybe you knew all this, if you don't there are mods and such you can download to help with the serverside crosshair.
Niin no, yleisesti ottaen ei tuossa ole mitään väärin. Takaraivosta vain pomppasi vanha peikko kun deflaatiota määritellään inflaation vastakohtana, koska vaikkakin tuo on oikein on niiden vaikutukset kuitenkin hieman erilaiset, ts. vaikka vallitsevan taloustieteen mukaan matala inflaatio on ihan ok juttu, mikään deflaatio ei oikeastaan ole kovin kiva juttu.
Except there are many more things than dick that might be goddess' gift to women.  There is so goddamn much more than anything that specifically requires a man in this world and to me that's what's valuable about 2XC.  Not that I'm against guys asking questions, as I'm sure many of my fellow 2XCer women have also been the "answer girl" for a lot of dudes irl.  (Yes, I've driven nervous [virgin] dudes to sex shops and discussed the merits of condom A vs condom B with them.)   BUT...we spend all day dealing with dudes straight/gay/whatever who think they're god's gift to the universe...to quote my Canadian tractor pop sister Shania Twain, "that don't impress me much." Sometimes we need a break. A virtual ladies' room, a virtual strip club locker room, a virtual maternity ward, a virtual lingerie shop, a virtual girlfriends coffee meeting.
So I have been seeing a lot of post lately in this NA protoss strategy forum with people having problems with mutalisks. As a player who not long ago had the same problems as people seem to be having I am here to offer some advice. To grasp how to use all these tips u probably need to be high plat or higher but there is stuff in this wall of text that players frome every leauge can use!   There is no easy fix a lot of ppl seem to want something like "Make this units and attack here and you will win". Playing vs mutas will put your multitasking to the test and it will not be easy.Making blink stalkers and getting cannons and storm wont matter for shit if you don't constantly pay attention and have good awarness.   First point I want to address is the fact that you need to scout them zergs as a protoss if you wanna play macro games against zergs you will need to first spot it. You should use your first zealot as much as possibel to confirm a third base so you know the zerg arent doing an all in or rush teching to mutas. and keep checking for it you need to know if it goes down. there are a bunch of muta builds and variouse fast tech builds that takes a third but delays it to make a faster lair.   If you are going to macro against zerg you need to get some scouting going fast so you know what the fudge is going on. No later then 10min and even then it might be to late. So make sure you have in your build a robo for an observer or hallucinate.   In all my macro builds vs zerg I will get both twilight and robo because fast uppgrades are awesome and observers are really important to playing reactionery PvZ. Don't be afraid to expand, the problem vs muta with expanding is not that you'r army is really weak and will get straight up killed vs mutas the problem is acctualy getting up your expand and protecting it with cannons and all the other good jazz like a wall in from zerglings or what have you.   As soon as you spot mutas get two cannons by your mineral line and if you have exposed tech somewhere then getting a cannon down there aswell can be a good idea.   get blink fast and a decent number of stalkers if you have started robo bay cancel that shit or if it is already up don't make any collosus you need all the gas you can get. also take all your gases. Make some observers and position them out on the map in locations where mutas tend to fly by. it is also crucial to have an obs in the opponents base scouting for tech switches to infestors or roaches and the hive timing. some zergs can just straigth out stop making mutas after they have been spoted and play roach infestor just to mess with u so keep on checking!   Don't bloody panic! This is the best advice I can give you regarding playing against mutas just keep ur units in postition and play focused and never go for a base trade. keep macroing up and get all the tech! take a 4th and then u can get some collosus play towards the late game cause eventualy mutas will suck and if he hasent done a large amount of damage then his tech becomes usless and u can still use yours so play for the fudging late game.   Once you got storm up keep 1-2 HTs in the mineral line where mutas attack and ur army isent going to remain (you should have HTs with ur army atleast 2) by mineral lines mutas can attack it is mostly all the mineral lines except for some maps like ohana where ur natural will pretty much never be targeted by mutas.   Most of u be thinking right now that "Bitch I already know all of this shit" Well here is something important aswell be aggressive with warp prism!  Make 2 of them suckas and keep droping and warping in zealots all over the place very few zerg can deffend against drops and hurrash with mutas at the same time. Usally the mutas are not in his base so getting there defending will take a while and u are attack multipel locations. U don't need minerals anyway and you dont need production from your robo for anything but observers for the most part so once ur third is establish and blink and u got some gates up go drop that punk ass zerg.   Eventually u will have ur mega army that consists of all the tech including mothership. And go win!
Scenario:  I'm on a booze filled trip to a casino, with dozens of college friends (fraternity organized).  Last night of trip I'm kickin' it with some of my friends (mostly female).   Night is kind of wrapping up.  My friend (female, named... Kiki) says "Hey, [Me] and "Mal" let's go back to the room" Me and Mal "Ok". (Kiki confided in me that she had had threesomes before, FFM).  As soon as we get to the room Kiki and Mal starting making out.  I lay on the bed, and get in on some of the action.  Shirts are coming off, shit is going down.  Just as the girls are about to get naked, Mal, has second thoughts. "I don't know, I mean, you guys are my two really good friends."  Looking back there are two ways I could of handled this: the gentle but firm way, or the coked-fueled confidence way, so I respond "Stop being such a freshman" (She was a college freshman at the time).  She starts to gather her clothes, but I stopping fooling around with Kiki and start to convince Mal to stay.  Just as she starts to see the light, someone bangs on the door.   "LET ME IN! I KNOW YOUR IN THERE! I NEED TO GET SOMETHING! I FORGOT MY KEY"  All the rooms were doubles, it was the other girl staying in the room for the weekend.  We try and stay quieter than Anne Frank.  "I SAW YOU GO IN! I NEED MY TAMPONS! I'M ON MY PERIOD." I relent, Mal freaks, and as soon as I unlock the door, Mal literally sprints out, and Aunt Margaret get her fuckin tampons.   Epilogue:  Me and Kiki continue to hook up, but, remember that part about "coke-fueled confidence", well I did  a lot  of cocaine that night, or at least a lot for someone who had only done it once before, so I couldn't get it up.  So in a sense, my own body cock blocked me.
Obviously capped lightning resist is a must, I'll have that capped not only because of Storm Heralds, but it's the most damaging out of the three elements when it comes to shock stacks.   I'll usually have a Grounding flask with me at all times, (dispels shock stacks).   Speaking of flasks, Staunching is a must as well, (dispels bleeds, also works with CORRUPTING BLOOD.)   Having Seething health flasks can also be beneficial, (66% less life recovered, life recovers instantly.)   I try to pay attention to the boss modifiers as closely as possible. If they have Soul Conduit, I'll kite them away from dead bodies. If they have fracture I'll anticipate popping a granite flask if I'm in the mix. I'll keep a warding flask for Hexfont and Bringer of Weakness/Fragility.
So you just by using E?   Estrogen only, highest dose, transdermal.   > That sounds great, and how did you feel?   Better than I did on Spiro + E. Made me hella paranoid even before I reacted to it.   >Since you're not full time yet you're on hormones, how does that affect your daily life   Okay this one is like a "take notes" moment for  anyone  who wants to do HRT but is waiting for any reason. Andrea James states this on her site, but I'll repeat it because it's important.   You can be on HRT for as long as you want and still pass as male .   I've been on it for two years now (tangent: with the only interruption being a two month holiday break + a month holiday break now because airport security is stricter in some places and I'm in 0.00 mood to have my ~200 dollars worth of 'mones lost or confiscated plus they use body scanners now and react weird to any sort of patch they see on you. I guess I could say it's a nicotine patch, but having it revealed when you're travelling in company that doesn't know the Tea.... not favorable.)   I can pass as male. I could pass as male 3-4 years on HRT. If I  wanted  to pass as male under any circumstance tbh I could. And so could a vast majority of TS women. Really you can pass even after FFS if you come up with a hell of a good lie for having undergone plastic surgery.   TS women have a strong delusion of the concept of passing imo, often assuming that because they go out places and no one says anything that no one knows and they "pass". No. It's 2015. Laverne cox, Carmen Carrera, Janet Mock, hell Bruce Jenner. The shock factor of the TS is kinda over and no one is in the mood to stare and gawk in this day and age. But that doesn't mean they don't damn well know you're "a dude in women's clothing".   I bring this up to point out that FFS is prevalent for a reason. Without surgery, a lot of us no matter how purely cunt  flattering angle or X amount of makeup makes us look are going to look like men.   If you take HRT, expect your face to become more femme. Like I can't deny that, as I said I do get called for female a lot to my own detriment. But it's not the entire pie. I also have a  very  feminine voice and that's my biggest passing tool. Like the second someone hears me talk they're like "Oh, that's a female, who's that girl, so on" but if you don't have that (and from the voice clips I've heard on sound cloud, feeeew women do) you will get read male even 2-3 years on HRT if you're in men's clothes with short hair and so on.   Now I must admit I did get read once. I work in my college and there was this more um... experienced girl, like she was 27 and came up to me radnomly in the middle of a convo where I was telling her about security like "Are you a trans person?" I was like a deer in the headlights, but just deny and keep it moving, won't be a problem. She knows damn well I'm some kind of TS (I think she thinks I'm FtM?) and often slips up calling me a she and her when telling someone where to put a clipboard, whatever. Like even if worst case worse someone who's very in the know of TS/TG culture and appearances COULD instantly tell, just deny it and keep it moving. Like it doesn't matter anyways lol.   /end rant/
When my parents were going through their divorce I had to deal with this a couple of times. When the situation came up where they ask my sister and I to pick between them, my sister and I looked at each other and got in her car and drove off. We stayed at one of her friend's house for about 4 or 5 days only going home when they were at work. We wouldn't answer their texts or phone calls. Putting the kids in the middle of a divorce is the greatest way to gain resentment from them. I would never tell my parents that I have a small amount of resentment for them putting my sister and me in the middle of their arguments.
Yes, happened to me in Nebraska.   I lived there at the time and was going through a divorce. I was feeling terrible that day and knew it would be better for me not to drive. Still, I had a job and I needed to be downtown to do it.   I hopped in the car, a little subcompact and got onto the interstate.   The speed limit was 55mph and I was doing 65. I came up on what was referred to as a Polish blockade. That is every lane is blocked and all going the same speed. After a few miles, someone exited and I scooted around the blockade. One other car, a full size sedan in the far left lane also took off. There was a fair amount of traffic and the sedan pulled up behind me and flashed his lights. I pulled over to let him pass and he went up to the next traffic blockage and matched their speed.   Son of a bitch was my thought. Guy was in a hurry and now this. I waited until traffic cleared and off I went again. Sedan did the same. Bigger car, more horsepower than what I had, the same thing again. I was steamed.   We came to a section of road that crosses another highway and the interstate went from three lanes to four over the bridge and then back to three after the bridge.   I took the fourth lane of the bridge to get around the blockage. But the man driving the sedan was furious as he was still blocked. He was weaving from lane to lane, blowing his horn and flashing his lights, anything to get through.   He finally got through and caught up to me. I was in the middle lane and he in the left.   He leaned across the seat and manually rolled down his passenger side window. He started screaming something out the window, but I don't know what he was yelling. I kept going as I didn't want to be around this dangerous person any longer than necessary.   We were rapidly approaching an intersection. The left lane went downtown, the center went further east and the right lane went south to another town. The man driving the sedan didn't see there was a vehicle in front of him as he was too busy yelling at me.   I didn't want him to hurt anyone, so at the last minute I tapped the horn and pointed to the car in front of him.   He slammed on the brakes and swerved into the median, spinning his car several times. I took the center lane, the next exit and then on downtown.   I didn't give it much thought, just glad he hadn't hit the other car. He didn't flip or hit anything, so I kept going.   Three days later I received a ticket in the mail.   I called an attorney I knew and asked what to do with it.   He told me to give him the number and would find out.   In less than ten minutes he told me to get in my car and drive over to his office very, very slowly, right now.   I did and upon arriving the receptionist told me he was waiting for me in the conference room.   The attorney had seven pages of notes of the traffic offenses that were charged against me. He didn't even bother to ask me what happened. He told me to go to the bank, get some money and go downtown and turn myself in, post bail and we would go to court.   I did as he said, and on the day of court, at first they couldn't find the ticket.   I have a common name, but with an unusual spelling. I told the attorney to look for it in their files in another location. After a few hours of looking they finally found it and into court we went.   But not traffic court, the bad boys court. It had taken us so long to find the ticket, traffic court was over. Now I was to plead my case in the same court as murderers and drug dealers.   They read the list of charges against me, and people in the galley had their mouths open. The undercover traffic officer was there with a pretty big grin on his face and the judge asked the prosecutor what to do.   The attorney had earlier told me there was no way they were going to let me off without pleading guilty to something, so he told me to pick one of the charges and he would try to make a deal.   The prosecutor told the judge I would plead guilty to improper lane change.   The judge turned red, threw his pencil in the air and screamed, "What am I even doing here?" Then turned his chair around so all we could see was the back of his chair.   After a few minutes he turned back to the prosecutor and asked how he could even consider something like that?   The prosecutor shrugged and said, "He doesn't have any prior offenses, your honor."   The judge looked at me and asked, "What was going on in your mind that day?"   I told him I was having a very bad day.   The judge was so angry, as was the undercover officer, but finally the judge said, "Improper lane change, $200!"   I went into the hallway to pay the fine and while there I asked the person if I could go to traffic school. Another $50 for the school and if I didn't have any additional offenses for the next year, I didn't, the ticket would be removed from my record.
I was stupid, /trees. Very stupid. I'll be the first to admit that I am responsible for what happened to me. I shouldn't have let myself get caught. I'm hoping some ents could maybe share any similar experiences and make me feel better.   I'm a freshman. 18. College. So, what happened yesterday? I smoked a joint in my dorm room. I shouldn't have, I know. First I just smoked a little out of my MFLB. And then I thought, hey, why not? Why don't I roll a small joint and smoke it? So I did. I opened my window, turned the fan on, put a towel under the door and used Frebreeze.   Then I went to my class. When I got out of class there was a campus security officer waiting for me. She had smelled marijuana from my room. She walked me to my dorm, at which time I realized there were four cop cars surrounding the building. I started hyper-ventilating at this point. I was walked into my room, where cops were already searching through my things.   I didn't have my weed (a gram or two at most) or my "paraphernalia" well hidden, so I figured there was no point in hiding what was out in the open. I handed over what I had while they continued searching the room. They confiscated my tweezers, saying I probably used them for "holding my joints" and questioned my oolong tea, "Is this K2?".   Then I was patted down, arrested in front of my building, brought to the police station and made to take off all of my clothes. This included taking off my bra and underwear in front of a female police officer, and then having to bend over so they could see if I had miscellaneous objects up my ass (the other women who came through the holding cell told me they were not made to do this). Then I was locked in a holding cell with nothing but some metal bedframes, a phone and a toilet for 20 hours.   Now I've got a hearing in a few weeks. Not the best day I've ever had.
Ran a similar route in experimental version, ran into 1 guy at Polkovo, we traveled to zelenogorsk together and killed a guy there. Server reset, I went alone up to Vybor where a guys was starving to death, I didn't have food but I tried to find an animal to eat. He died from starvation. I went to NWAF and cautiously surveyed the area. I ended up looting the entire airfield without being shot at or seeing any other players.
Basically, damage will only transfer between two blocks that share a face with each other.   I'm going to point out that that's pretty intuitive. Think about it: why would damage from weapons jump gaps instead of heating up the blocks physically connected to it instead? This is the principle used by real life armour schemes to defeat shaped charge type armour-piercing shells.   About the only weapon for which this is counterintuitive would be railguns: because of how real life ones work, I would expect less energy proagation through block faces and more damage in a direct line regardless of gaps.  However, that wouldn't help gameplay much as you would need significantly more accuracy to do practical damage, so I can forgive the use of "railgun" to mean "hitscan high-damage high-accuracy weaponn like most games do.
Sitting alone in my room at the tender age of 4-5 playing with the Fisher Price Little People (the ones from the 70's-90's that were actually wood pegs with faces) [This exact set.]( I found a bead from a bracelet I had broken with the intention of using the beads as dollhouse food. It had these TINY seed beads so I decided to put one up my nose. I had done this before with pea-sized beads and since hey were big, mailmen blew them out. So this tiny one goes in, and it's IN. No amount of finger is getting this one out. So I did the next logical thing. I sucked in through my nose as hard as I could, and felt it drop down my throat. Still hate the sensation of swallowing pointy things to this day.
My family, girlfriend, basically everyone.   Telling me that I don't know what's going into my body, or I'm gonna die from cancer, or even water collecting in my lungs.   Ironic thing is, no matter how many articles I show them. Or whatever proof that vaping is probably a hell of a lot better than smoking I show to them ends up being ignored.   They would much rather believe some asshole that they talk to, telling them about an article they read which is so old I could frame it and hang it up.   This is really driving me off the edge. It's like I'm alone in trying to win a war against myself.   Sorry I just needed to rant and I felt like this subreddit was most appropriate.
This will get buried, but I've been looking for a place to dump this shit story.   I won't bother with the full story, but let me sum this up. Me, being 22, walked in on my best friend, 25 years old, of three years (also what could be considered an almost boyfriend for most of that time, a roommate of over a year, and also owes me about $6000-7000), in bed with my soon-to-be roommate, the day after her 19th birthday (who had been in a relationship with my best friend of five years, for a little over a year and a half.) If that made sense to you, fucked up huh?   I ended up having to be the one to tell him what had happened. She called him the day after to warn him he might hear rumors, but nothing was true. When he asked to see her face to face, she said she couldn't take looking him in the eye. My exboyfriend admitted, finally, that he knew what he was doing but didn't think he was causing harm to anyone. And then cried and begged for my friendship. One day, about a week later, he ceased all contact and I shut off the cell phone my parents had bought him and had been paying for. I have not heard from him since.   The events that followed were just as hard to swallow. I had to involve the police to get my belongings back from both of them, and had to say goodbye to my money. I subsequently wrote off another 10-12 friends who continued to be friends with them, condoned their behavior, and help spread malicious rumors about myself and my friend of five years, both equally scorned in this situation. We were accused of burying our pain with excessive amounts of cocaine, of stalking their homes, and being legally insane. Looking back, I realize that this event just made the life event of shedding your childhood bullshit and starting fresh as an adult just happen a lot quicker, and probably a little more painful that it had to be.   In the end, my friend and I came out on top. The slut exgirlfriend now weighs barely 90lbs, is pushing her pills onto friends, and has to snort her klonopine because taking it orally is no longer effective. Her apartment was also raided by the police two weeks after this incident. She probably lost close to $1000 in glass. She is paying the way of my (for all intents and purposes) exboyfriend with the money she inherited from her mother when she killed herself. His car has not been driven since shortly after we cut ties, his friends are calling me to complain about how worthless he is, as well as how disgusting she is. The two of them began sleeping together even before she formally broke up with her boyfriend, my friend of almost six years now. He has HPV, as does she, so it's kind of like they're both trying to be Pokemon trainers at this rate. (Gotta catch 'em all!) I also got the job he has applied twice for in the last year. He's admitted to his friends that he's just keeping her around because "she'll suck his dick and pay his way." Sad huh?
We were the exception. We started dating 1-2 months after being friends and became inseperable ever since. We had our ups and downs like everyone else, our doubts, our fights.   We stuck together until I went abroad for 1 year to study. We broke up while I was away. We got back together when I came back, everything was okay. We both grew up. I had to quit college. It's now been one year since then.   He's been busy now. He's studying a very demanding course and he needs time. I came back to college. He's never had much time for me. It's okay, it was all worth it.   He'd never had doubts before. I was the apple of his eye and he loved me so much that he never questioned it. I was not like that. When he met me he believed love conquered all, he believed we should need eachother to the point of it being impossible to not speak to eachother for a single day. He was a hopeless romantic and I was a cynic. We don't need eachother, we choose to be with eachother and we wouldn't have it any other way. It won't last forever, we're young, but we'll make the absolute best of it. We won't die if we break up, we'll understand and move on.   With time he started seeing things like I do and the pressure of the future and the unrealistic expectations that came with the relationship definitly faded. Things had been close to perfect. I learned to control my emotions and to take a step back to clear my head. He learned to never lie to avoid conflict and to manage time for me. We fought better, we communicated better, we understood eachother. All my doubts faded and I was willing to give up the common things that come with "youth" to stay with him. I was willing to and I couldn't wait. He's my world, my bestfriend.   He's been busy now. So much work, so many projects. He has doubts. He's not sure I'm the one he wants anymore. He loves me, but he's not sure. He's not sure of anything in his life anymore. He loves me, but he's sorry. So sorry. He can't keep me waiting for something he isn't sure will come.   I say okay. I understand, truly. He deserves someone who he's sure of. He deserves the best. He is the best. I'm angry but I tell him, I'm sorry for any anger, I can't control it very well right now, please know, I love you and I will never hold this agains't you. It's true. He needs to relax, he needs to focus on college, to focus on the things that matter. The things he's sure will matter.   I want him to be happy. There's nothing I want more. I love him so much. To the moon and back. I'm heartbroken. I don't know what to do with these feelings. I want him to regret it and come back. I want him to move on and be happy with someone who can make him the happiest he ever was. It sucks the air out of me, it pushes and pulls agains't my chest and I can't. Breathe.   I want him to regret it. I don't know what to do. What should I do? Am I horrible for wanting that? I'm sorry, I don't know what to feel, I don't know what to do.
I worked a Chickie's and Pete's down on Packer Ave for a summer. I was on my way home after a rowdy shift because Philly Union had just played Manchester United here in the city and the place was mobbed with crazy fans. I get to the Oregon stop and go to board a North bound train home and as the doors open I see a sea of red. This entire train was absolutely  stuffed  with Manchester supporters. The press of people was insane and once I got on there was really no moving as I was spooning and being spooned by my fellow travelers.  It goes with out saying that Philly sports fans can be a bit unhinged, but the crazy on display in the train from the ManU fans was actually terrifying. It took all of one stop for me to regret my dissision on boarding this train but I wasn't able to fight my way to the doors thru the crush of fans.  The Manchester fans were having a ball chanting slurs directed at Philly Union and the atmosphere was a tinder box and very much riot esque when I heard it.  From some where in the back of my car, some stupid son of a fuck decided he wanted to commit suicide via soccer hooligan by shouting "MANCHESTER EATS DICKS!". There were two weedy, south Philly types pressed against the very back wall of the car. A small speck of navy blue in an angry, overwhelming sea of red, and they wouldn't stop bleating weak insults back at their English counterparts. The mood on the train changed from mildly terrifying drunken frivolity, to "where the shit are those Philly shit heads!? Lets fuck them up!" And there I stood, all 5'3 and 120 lbs of me in my Uniform which happened to sport,in super large and hard to mis letters across my back, "PHILADELPHIA, PA". I believed I was likely about to die and pressed my back against the person behind me to hide the offending noun and hoped to ever loving baby jesus the red hue of my shirt would camouflage me and cause me to be overlooked by the angry mob. I finally escaped at Lombard st. Soaked in beer that had been thrown at me when a few hooligans did catch sight of my shirt. Over all I was no worse for wear but Fucking shit it was the most crazy BSL ride of my life.
We posted a thread before about it being a CS:S community but decided to change to 1.6 because of suggestions.)   Oldschool Counter-Strike is a CS community established by me  Addemod  and  Speedypro . We are really interested in hosting online tournaments and servers for everyone in Europe. What we want to do is host a "throwback tournament" like the good old days when CS 1.6 was in the spotlight.   Here is a form for an interest check. The interest check is used to determine if there are actually people that are willing to play this tournament. You can also give your own suggestions at the bottom of the page if we missed something. Click here to go to the page:   You can join our [steam group]( to get updated instantly with new information. We will update the group page and also edit this post as soon as we have new information.   We are also looking into running CS 1.6 and CS:S servers, where we will have our own skillbased system. Not like matchmaking but you will be able to gain and lose ELO based on your personal performance, not how good or bad your team plays. With your ELO-points you can join servers with higher minimum ELO-level. This will be achieved with a custom coded SourceMod plugin that is actually being worked on at the moment.   Steam group:  Interest check:   Thank you.
Hey guys, I'm playing conquest on Nebandan Flats and I got screwed over at B, and I respawn at A..I see one of the fellas hop on the dirtbike(It's through the machines and fence) boom headshot, his buddy drives away...boom headshot. Still not sure if I like the JNG..sorry had to tell someone!
my brother, cousin and i, went to washington dc to visit another cousin. she lived on the 8th floor and the water had been turned off to the whole building for maintenance. we ate some bad sausage and my cousin started to get sick. he didn't want to use my cousins last flush, so he ran out the door, rode the elevator, ran through the lobby and the first set of doors before throwing up on the second set of lobby doors... 15 minutes later i found him shitting in the bushes of the russian embassy(across the street).
Everyone knows that wards last for 3 minutes and require 3 hits to destroy and I'm sure everyone has been in that situation where they get 1 to 2 autos in before it goes invisible. Well I think it would be cool if say you get 1 auto off on a ward that it would reduce the duration of the ward by 1 minute or 30 seconds that way players can get some sort of reward from attacking wards when they are placed.
This is actually my favorite thing in League, and the reason I play jungle! I personally find jungle easiest to call from, but there are plenty of support callers too.   Firstly, practice is your best friend. You need to get comfortable making decisions, and your team needs to be comfortable blindly adhering to them. The first thing to kill a shot-call is for a team-mate to be late because they're arguing, or disagree entirely and never go. Commitment and speed is the name of the game here.   Practice includes understanding  the game as a whole better. If you're team has equal mechanics, leadership is the next determining factor to success. This means you need to fully become a student of the craft, and absorb as much knowledge as you can. Personally, I felt the effectiveness of my calls improve so dramatically over time as my knowledge and ability improved, it was the definition of rewarding!   I can't stress big-picture mechanics enough (after practice, of course). Understanding what your teams ganks are like, dragon clear speeds, tower pushing, team fight, etc are all liquid from game to game and it's up to you to maintain the knowledge on how your compositions stack up -- applying your strengths against their weaknesses will make you win! Consider being a captain in drafts as well to orchestrate better comps.   Don't micro manage! This is something I see some shotcallers do, and it's infuriating! This is still mechanical even for jungle/supports, so you can't be focusing on what everyone else is doing. Additionally, you should trust in the relative expertise of your team-mates. Keep your calls to broad tasks, and let them decide how best to do it. I.E. Take dragon, push bottom, back to defend, prepare to fight in x minutes, etc. It's also  mostly  your job to inform your team mates of whats happening on the minimap. Keep them informed and direct their movements.   Sometimes, it's best to say nothing. There will be times where your team is naturally flowing and each player is making good use of their time, resources, and location. You'll start to pick up on lulls in the gameplay of your team-mates, and this is where you are most important! Often times players will need direction because they either just completed a task, or got denied or killed while attempting to do it and aren't sure what to do or try next -- watch out for the infinite loopers. Some players will continually reattempt the same thing until they do it, and this can be lethal.   Final point, avoid shot-calling with strangers outside of the biggest objectives. Convenience and pings are the keys here. If you're already next to dragon and you can, ping it. If you could normally dragon with a cohesive group but that would require some decent traveling for some players, ignore it in solo. Players simply won't listen and then rage when you die and give up drag with ~3% hp left.
When I was 15, I had my first boyfriend and we were kinda long-distance - saw each other maybe 2 times a month, as we lived and hour away from each other. We had been together for almost a year, when I finally felt ready to have sex with him - he really genuinly was a really nice and caring guy and had put no pressure on me what so ever (he was my first). I had gone there during holidays and had to leave the next day for family get-togethers at home, and he had a few parties with his old classmates. I had always trusted him, as he really just was a good guy, but I'd never liked how one of his best girlfriends looked at him. A few days pass, and then he calls me up at 3am, seeming half-drunk, very upset and it sounds like he's walking outside. He proceeds to tell me, that three days ago at the first party, he had gone with one of his mates to lay down in a bedroom to catch a break since they were both pretty drunk and that he'd then fallen asleep. Next thing he knows, he apparently woke up to one his girlfriends trying to give him a handjob, which he quickly stops. I'm pretty upset about it, buit I tell him that I believe that it wasn't his fault, and that I'm glad he told me - I forgave him. He then breaks down sobbing and I can hear him stop walking and sit down. He tells me that he was now walking home from the second party, and that he'd gotten way too drunk. He tells me that he was outside, talking to his best girlfriend about something that had upset her, and next thing she's going down on him. And that he didn't do a damn thing to stop the blowjob for at least 5 minutes, but just stood there until he eventually figured it was wrong. He had then immediatly walked home and called me up. I was pretty devastated, but still said that I knew it wasn't ever his intention to cheat on me. He agreed, but then proceeded to tell me that maybe we should break it off, for my sake - it wasn't fair to me, he said, and he was really upset. I started to panick, 'cause I was really in love with him first love, lol), and told him that I forgave him and that we could work through it. But he insisted that for my sake, I shouldn't contact him any further.   That night I cried my heart out in the shower, and felt really hollow the next couple of days - why didn't he think we could work it out? Didn't he love me anymore? And just when we'd begun a new chapter in our relationship too (uh, the sex). So after a few days I texted him and called him, asking him to at least talk to me so we could talk it out, and I could get some answers. He ignored me at first, still for my own good, but I didn't know what the fuck to do, so I kept calling and eventually picked up. We talked, and eventually also continued visiting each other. So our relationship continued kinda "unofficial" for 2 months, where things where going pretty good. But I just couldn't get the thought out of my head, that I somehow had to cleanse him or my mind or whatever,  from her , and it just drove me mad - he also tried to keep a distance to his friend, but they'd been best friends since they were babbies, so it was hard. He didn't cheat on me again, but he began to get frustrated and a bit aggressive when he was a bit drunk and his regrets took over. After going home to his place after a party one night, I woke up in his bed and I just felt a gut-ripping hollow kick in my stomack - I just knew that this would be the day it would all be over. I laid watching him sleep for a few hours, when eventually I woke him up and we talked. And I cried. And yelled. And we broke up. I had to leave the same day, and before leaving I turned in the door asking him one last time if he thought we could ever work through it. He just replied "No. You should go home, and get on with your life." I almost hyperventilated from crying, but walked away.   To this day I still don't know whether to quite classify his acts as cheating or not. I wasn't just a gullible fool; he genuinly truly was a really good guy, who cared about me lots, and he got a bit too drunk - not that neither he or I ever thought that that was a proper excuse. I believed that he hadn't meant to cheat on me, and it really just made it all the more confusing for me that he was such a good guy. It took me a lot to get over that breakup, questioning myself for a long time and my selfesteem really took a hit. I'm doing just fine know, and have had several boyfriends since (and have no trust-issues whatsoever), but remembering this is actually still very hard.
Mind if I clear up a few misconceptions? (aka help you from getting your ass arrested from a mistake) This is not legal advice. I am not your lawyer. Please consult your lawyer before making any legal decisions.   In your first post, I would definitely say "I want my lawyer, and I invoke my right to remain silent" if you say nothing they will keep interrogating you until you crack. If you invoke your Miranda rights they MUST stop interrogating you, they can continue to ask "non-interrogatory" questions like your name and address. If you answer these, you have waived your invoked right. Without waiving your rights you can't be interrogated for the next 14 days.   A pat-down  is  a search (and a seizure) it's just permitted to be warrantless by  Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 (1968), that doesn't mean they can do it "whenever they want" they need to have a "Reasonable and articulatable suspicion", which means when they bring this evidence in front of a magistrate they need to be able to say exactly what made them search you, and it has to be better than "he visited a known drug-dealer". Just make sure you never consent to it, "Mind if I pat you down?" "No, I'm not comfortable with that, I don't like being touched" It's rare that they can make you remove items of clothing without probable cause, you're right to ask if you have to. Make up an excuse why you don't want to, don't lie, "Take off your jacket" "Do I have to? It's cold."   They can only demand your ID and take you in for not having it in states that have "stop and identify" statutes. NY is one, IN is another. Check your local statutes. If there isn't one present, you do NOT have to answer an officer's questions, if you continue walking and say "oh, sorry, I don't have time right now!" they cannot force you to stop without a reasonable and articulatable suspicion. Saying "No way!" and running ABSOLUTELY creates reasonable (and articulatable) suspicion ( Illinois v. Wardlow , 538 U.S. 119 (2000)). You have to answer in a way that seems fairly innocent. Same goes for home searches.   Cops can legally do knock-and-questions, if you fake not being home they will be gaining a reason to come in. If they have reason to believe that you're home, and intentionally stalling, they WILL assume you are destroying evidence. Acknowledge you're home, "No thank you, I'm busy" "It's the police" "Do you have a warrant? I'm really in the middle of something right now." If there is no way they know you're home you might try and fake it. But, be careful. They cannot enter your home without a warrant unless you give them an exigent circumstance.   If there is nothing they can see from the doorway, (Bong hidden? Been burning more incense than anything else? Or been smoking on the other side of the house?) and you're sure of this. Just open the door some and talk to them. Of course don't do this if you have anything to hide, go with the first option, but if you're clear then it's slightly less suspicious. Hell, if you have a house with a mudroom (outer door, small room, inner door) and aren't smoking enough to make it smell (or install an air freshener in there, or a couple! it's not suspicious, it's the smelliest room in the house) Close the inner and open that outer door wide. Remove their suspicions, and make damn sure they won't enter without a warrant. Don't be so paranoid about them lying about seeing something, even if they see something in plain view they still need a warrant (They just now have a basis for one) so while you wait, obviously take pictures of the whole thing. If the trial judge believes the cop that you hid the bong and then took pictures (get some from his view) then... appeal that shit. Any good lawyer should argue for you that the very act of you picking up the bong if you were "hiding" it would have given them an exigent circumstance to enter.   Otherwise, if they have a warrant you're finished, if they don't do NOT let them past the thresh hold or give them probable cause, or an exigent circumstance.   Speaking of exigent circumstances, can we go back to the big one? Cars. Car searches are totally different than home or person searches because cars are inherently mobile, so you could destroy the evidence before they get a warrant, or just be gone. You are NOT secure in your car because of the logic that if you were in an accident they could see it all anyway. When you are pulled over for a traffic stop, they can do a stop and frisk (look in your windows) for items in plain view. If they see something? Probable cause. Probable cause is ALL they need to open your car to a search. The cop faking smelling something is possible, but unlikely (more likely is actually that they DO smell something, if you smoke in your car, or have in those clothes and haven't washed it, it smells more than you think), because as you said, if it turns out to be in your trunk, they are screwed. Plus, it looks bad if you turned out to be innocent. If they are pulling you over on pretext anyway, they have other ways to search you that are more reliable.   Like arrest. Search incident to arrest in cars was really limited by  Arizona v. Gant  129 S. Ct. 1710 (2009), they can now only search for evidence of the crime you were arrested for. If it's expired registration that opens up car holds but speeding or seat belts? Just your person. Remember, if they have probable cause for drugs? They can search your car anyway, so they don't need an excuse to arrest you. Beyond this though, they can't just leave your car at the side of the road, so if there is no one nearby to grab it? Impound lot. What happens when they check a car into an impound lot? They have to check inventory so that you can't claim something is missing! That involves going through every single item in the car. So... don't get yourself arrested while driving alone if you're hiding drugs in the trunk (And ALWAYS hide your drugs in the trunk. In luggage in the trunk if possible.)   If they are holding you and don't let you go, but don't arrest you, ask if you're free to go (Again, with excuses people, "I really have some work to get done at home" "Officer, if we're done here, I might poop myself if we hang out any longer, I ate a dicey looking breakfast burrito") if they keep you too long after you've asked their dog visit (dogs are never searches because they can only detect illegal things, so there is no concern that you'll have to expose anything private but legal) is no longer valid and even if they get a hit and search you it will likely be excluded. They can't extend the time and make you wait for a dog to come, then you are becoming unreasonably seized. Of course, if they already have a dog there, you're so boned.   Well, that's the short version. Hope you stayed tuned.
I am Platinum 1 MID/ADC and i bought Yasuo and went into a game with 4 friends to test him.He is really potent on lane while farming, his Q is so damn tricky to hit with.Its range is like a needle, and if you do manage to get so close to anyone he will trade more back.I realize he has got a shield.I still do win some trade, but the real problem is his ulty.   It is so unreliable in team fights, its suppose to give you 50 armor pent, but only works when someone knocks up someone which is like 0.5 interval, and if someone does knock someone up in a team fight, and you do manage to ulty someone, you die instantly by a good team.So 50armor pent is worthless.   Problems with his Q : His Q has a short cool-down, as i said its range is like a needle, and you have to poke someone 3 times, in order to active your whirlwind, and then you need to hit that whirlwind, in order to ulty someone, well if you manage to do all, and kill him. You still are in a middle of an enemy team and you try to dash away, but it is to slow.   Problems with his W  : It is fairly good spell, but it has fixed range, and if someone already engages like ahri, its hard to block any of her spells.But seems like its very balanced tho. Sorry for bad formatting its my first time posting a serious post like this. Please if you don't agree with me tell me why, cause i really want to try to improve with him.
Based" is just slang. It means to have a home base, like to be all set with a house, a car, whatever. In this slightly different context, "based" basically means "Fuck everyone else, I have everything I need."
One year ago, I met a girl named Anna at the wedding of two of my really good friends, Mike and Lily. Lily was roommates with Anna and always wanted us to hit it off, but Anna lives a good 800 miles from where the three of us live.   The wedding was amazing. Anna and I had an awesome evening dancing and celebrating. I loved getting to know her, but I wasn’t sure how realistic it’d be to pursue anything because she lived so far away. I was too chicken to ask for her number, and so we went our separate ways. Little did I know that Lily had given Anna my number, and a couple months later, I received a text from her. We talked every other day or so, and not long after long this, I flew out to the city where she lives in visit my brother, who lives there as well. I met up with her a few times during my visit, and when I left, I really felt like this could be worth pursuing.   We continued talking the next few months after that when I began to realize that I was the one who was initiating all of our conversations. Calls (once a week) went unanswered, then she’d text back asking if she could call me in the next couple days. I didn’t think much of it, but this was literally happening every time I called. Then one time she never called back when she said she would. At this point I was like, alright, I can take a hint. I hate feeling like I’m annoying someone, so I stopped calling and texting to see if she’d initiate any. Nothing for 2 months. Then a text came, and the whole thing repeated itself. Talked every other day, then she’d be a little slower to respond, then not answer at all.   I just don’t know what this means. Can there really be people who exist that have feelings for someone, but never initiate conversation?   I heard from Lily that she got me a Christmas present (most likely an inside joke gift) that she’s waiting to give me when I go out there to visit my new niece in a few months, and that she always tells Lily how awesome I am. But I just can’t wrap my mind around not being the one to ever initiate a text or call to someone you like.   Anyways, I set up a phone date with her tomorrow night, and I’m really just considering opening up to how I feel about her, even though I think I’ve been more than obvious about it.
With the change a few months back to the two Thoughtseize and three random decks does it make sense to get into these as sealed product? My LGS is willing to sell me a box of five (if I prepay) for $120. Obviously this is $30 BELOW MSRP, and they have a promo where every time you spend over $10 you get a stamp and when you get five stamps you get a 10% off code...I have a few and can spend one on this purchase.
I think this is probably a classic RPG problem, but I'm fairly new to the whole thing, so I thought I'd ask.  The rules say that you can do one Medicine check in an encounter, but it doesn't specify any limits outside of combat and or an encounter.   So for example, if a crew is on their ship, and they do not have the time to naturally rest away their wounds and they do not have stimpacks to recover them either, could they sit for a while and continually roll Medicine checks to heal up completely?   Is it all up to the story/GM/logic of the situation, or is there a rule or idea that I may be missing?  I have to assume rolling 10 Medicine checks in a row is not fun for anyone, so I should limit them, but then it feels like there should be an official rule.  On the opposite end, I don't want them rolling 10 times so I just heal them up with a rest, but then whats the point of ever using the written rule of 1 wound per night?   Sorry for the long train of thought, this is the summary of questions brought up between a friend and myself (my friend loves rules, but I love story so we want to find the right path).
Looking for some opinions here. Little background on me: I currently ride a 2002 GSX-R600. I've put over 35000 miles on the bike, and it's been great. But now I'm looking for the next step. I'm not ready to give up the sportbike thing completely, but want something with a bit more relaxed riding position. I've narrowed it down to these two monsters, and am wondering if one is clearly better than the other. No track days, MAYBE the occasional dragstrip is all it would see, so outright speed isn't a concern for me. Comfort and reliability reign.   Please, no comments of "don't get one of those, get THIS instead" or "you'll kill yourself on that thing." I'm a safe, responsible rider, able to handle myself and a bike pretty much automatically. It's definitely down to these two, so...HELP!
I'm a voice performance major, so Opera is kind-of my thing, and there are so many different pieces I'd pick depending on the person... I try to tailor the choices I present to people to things I think they'd enjoy. Some of the old standbys -  Nessun Dorma  from  Rusalka ... Literally anything from  Rigoletto , though it's probably most famous for  La Donna e Mobile  to show a complete stranger would be [Lensky's Aria]( from  Eugene Onegin  and [Una Furtiva Lagrima]( from  L'Elisir d'Amore , specifically that performance by Matthew Polenzani.   It's so hard to represent this particular genre in snippets, because nothing in this world compares with the emotional roller-coaster you WILL go through if you watch a full opera, start to finish, live. However, I think those two arias both capture enough of that emotional pull that, if you listen, you'll feel enough to want a little bit more.
Hey r/ainbow. I'm a 26 year old straight guy who's been best friends with a gay guy for 20 of those years. We've been through a lot together, but last night he told me he has HIV and found out earlier that day. After the initial telling I tried to stay as strong as possible for him but when I got home after a night of drinking and trying to help him as much as I could, I broke down hard, to the point I couldn't even stand up. I'm very worried and I know this isn't the 80s and HIV isn't necessarily a death sentence anymore but I could use some advice and support. So if any of you know of anything I can do to maybe help my friend out besides being supportive, I would really appreciate the advice.
SPOILERS   Firstly, I know this anime is a couple years old and I have read other threads that more or less discuss the same topic, but I'm posting this because I have a few questions that weren't really touched upon in those threads. Also, I very much enjoyed Oreimo, despite what I consider to be an absolute trainwreck that kinda pissed me off for a few days.   Also SPOILERS, I don't want to blackout the entire post.   So, the ending. It was very unsatisfying for me, and I think that most people agree. However, what I have seen fairly repeatedly is that the (major) reason for Oreimo ending badly was that it made people uncomfortable. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not even a little bit into incest or anything, and it probably should make you a little uncomfortable or grossed out. But I wasn't at all uncomfortable when Kyousuke chose Kirino. If you were, that is fine, but I thought it had been clear for a long time that those 2 had more than just siblings feeling between them. It had seemed like almost the entire anime had been developing Kyousuke and Kirino's relationship and wasn't able to be surprised during the confession scene.   I have a much bigger problem with the way how he completely denied his entire harem so that he could pick Kirino only to "break up" shortly after. I also have an issue with Manami and Kyousuke's fight where he says things like how he doesn't care about how society views them, and they'll keep it secret if they have to in order to be together. Which was also immediately proven not true... he knew that his relationship with Kirino would be ending shortly but still chose to defend it and "End his first love before it began" - Referring to Manami. Kyousuke's feelings toward Kirino seemed to be strong to warrant rejecting Manami's feelings, but apparently he was pretty eager to only date Kirino for just the few weeks that they did, a move that indicates less strong feelings. I was annoyed by the "reset" ending too, I don't really enjoy watching 30+ episodes and then receive a nothing really changes ending. Yes, they were certainly closer and maybe this was a story about how they learned to love each other as siblings. This would be/is fine but I don't think their actions made sense for this, and it didn't seem to be the "moral/impression" that I was supposed to receive.   Kirino's feelings seemed to be those of lovers as well also, and existed for more than just a moment, as shown by her voice recordings on the iPod.   A lot of the above is opinion. I don't think it I'm wrong but it isn't correct either.   I have also read that author was pressured into NOT having an incest ending, and that the readers/viewers can take the ending with a grain of salt, for it was not what the author would have written otherwise. This makes me feel better, and to me makes sense, so I have chosen to believe this and basically put an asterisk on the ending.   So what were your thoughts on Oreimo? Was it a good ending after all? If not, what was it that bothered you? Am I missing anything or misinterepting things?   Thanks for struggling through my rant
Honestly, dating someone who doesn't adhere to the same lifestyle as you do can be a very delicate balance. first and foremost you need to feel as though your beliefs are being respected, like they feel their choices need to be respected. setting out your expectations in the very beginning can help combat a lot of the issues vegans can face farther down the road when dating an omni. On that note, my boyfriend an i have been together for about 6 months now, and have been good friends for years before even dating. he knew my expectations from the get-go, and that if he couldn't be respectful towards me, it wouldn't work out. another important thing to consider is how you would react later on when, say, you move in together. would you be comfortable living with someone who buys and contributes to animal abuse and commodification? this is a big one for me, when i move away from home i don't intend on there being any of that kind of stuff in the house. so ultimately what is most important for me, and what may be a good point of consideration for you too, is to focus less on what their diet is now, and consider their open-mindedness and willingness to become vegan later on. a lot of people simply don't know what kind of atrocities are happening.
So here's the story:   I had just gotten done grabbing some delicious Dairy Queen with three of my friends when we decided that we had nothing to do. It's about 6:30 pm. Thinking of some possible solutions to our boredom, I suggested that we go to my house and smoke, as no one was home and I have an N64 with Super Smash Brothers, a favorite activity of those guys.   Everyone agreed with the plan, and 10 minutes later, we're walking up my driveway. I opened the garage door, and sure enough, no cars - an indication that no one is home.   Keep in mind: the reason why no one was home was because my sister had a swim meet, and my mom was attending to watch her. These summer swim meets usually start around 6 and end around 10-10:30, so I'm thinking we're home free for a good long while.   Anyway, we head upstairs to my room and start grinding up some bud. To speed up the process, one of my friends goes ahead and sets up Smash so there aren't any high shinanigans after we get done smoking.   To give you some context of where we smoked, my room is basically connected to the guest room in my house via a three-part bathroom that essentially makes a right angle. You have one sink area that immediately connects to my room, a corner room that consists of a toilet and shower/bathtub, and another sink area which connects to the guest room.   What we do is all pile into that little corner room, shut all the doors (there are doors that connect all three parts), turn on the ventilator for the smell, and smoke in peace. It's actually pretty awesome, and every day I thank the marijuana gods for granting me such a blessing of a set-up.   So anyway, we smoke in there for about 15 minutes, file out of the bathroom, and my three friends hung out in my room while I put away all the stuff. It took a little while to remember, but all of a sudden, one of my friends exclaims, "Who's ready to get their ass raped in Smash?" and a flurry of excited remarks soon followed as they got up to go into the bonus room where my N64 is located.   So there I am, putting away all the shit, when the friend that made the move to play Smash suddenly says to me, "The TV is on downstairs."   My bonus room is upstairs. The only television we turned on is the one in the bonus room. Someone else is in my house. Spoiler alert: it's my mom.   So there I am, thinking, Fuck me, what the hell do I do now.   Keep in mind, we just smoked, and I'm blazed. My friends are blazed. You might as well say there was a forest fire in my house, because that is how blazed we were. Logic is not at an all-time best right now.   No one has left my room yet, and the only thing open is the door, so here's the plan I come up with: Let's just go through my bathroom, through the guest room, and into the bonus room from there so we don't make any noise, and maybe my mom won't come upstairs because she won't hear us. Perfect!   So everything goes according to plan, we all sit down, and start playing. Silly me, however, because I seemed to forget that video games make noise, and, so do we.   Well, about 15 minutes go by, and sure enough, the hall light outside the bonus room flicks on. Fuck. I think, maybe she'll just come in, say hi, and go away.   So, she comes in, and turns on the lights in the bonus room. I pause the game and prepare mentally for this conversation from Hell.   "Hey guys! Whatchu up to?"   "Hey Mom! Not much, just playing some video games!"   "That's weird, because I came home and I didn't think anyone was here." (because we were smoking in the bathroom)   "Oh, really? (stoned as fuck) Well, we were in my room for a little bit and then we came in here," (which, technically, is the truth.)   "Oh ok, so you sure you guys aren't up to anything?"   The whole time she's asking me these questions, she's looking at me and holding awkward contact for a really long time. And I'm getting nervous. Why is she staring at me so awkwardly? Why won't she go away? Why the hell is she not at the swim meet!?   "Yeah, nope, just chillin, playing Smash."   "Alright." and she leaves.   The door closes, and I'm looking at my friends like, holy shit, what the fuck just happened. Total buzz kill.   We sat there in silence for about thirty seconds. One of my friends turns to me and asks, "You think she knew?"   I respond, "Dude, I have no fucking clue."   So, I unpause the game and we continue playing. About another two matches go by, and, what do you know, the god damn hall light flicks on again.   FUCK!!!!! WHAT THE HELL COULD SHE POSSIBLY WANT NOW?!   Door opens, bonus room light turns on.   There's my mom, standing there, but this time, with a plate in her hand. Sitting on this plate, are four brownies, each on one corner of the plate. Now, she had made these brownies a few days ago, so it's not like she just whipped them up or anything, but still, I'm like, what the fuck is going on.   "Since you guys are being so honest with me, I decided to bring you up some brownies to enjoy!"   She sets the brownies on the table, looks me straight in the eye, stares into my soul for what seemed like days, and leaves without saying another word. Door shuts, bonus room light still on.   I sit there, think for about 10 seconds, and say to my confused, anxious, shitting themselves friends, "Alright guys, you should probably leave now. Time for damage control."   My mother, normally happy, optimistic, innocent, and loving, turned on bitch mode like that fucking hall light switch that I now despise oh so very much. Those brownies were like an ace up her sleeve, the atom bombs that ended World War II, Miguel Cabrera with the bases loaded. With subtle sarcasm, she not only confirmed that she knew I was being dishonest, but totally killed my high and made me feel like an asshole.   Anyway, the four of us go back into my room and while they grab their stuff, I walk over to the mirror to see how bad my eyes are.   They are the reddest they have ever been in my entire life, not even kidding. It was like destiny or something. At this point I'm thinking, god damnit it you fucking retard, why didn't you put eye drops in! How could you forget to do that! You even knew your mother was home for crying out loud! It was a low moment.   So, I perform the walk of shame down the stairs, my friends behind me, and we walk down the hallway and out into the garage. Before they take off, I ask one of my friends for his drops, put them in, say farewell, and they wished me good luck as they briskly paced down the driveway. They knew I was in for a rough conversation.   So, I go back in the house, and my mom is sitting on the couch, watching TV.   I sit down next to her, and we talked.   "You wanna know what we were doing when you came home?" I asked.   "I thought you said you weren't doing anything..." (Again with the sarcasm)   "Look, Mom, we were smoking pot in my bathroom."   After that, we just talked. I was still high as fuck, and I don't remember a majority of the conversation, but basically I told her I'd been smoking for about a year and that since I started nothing has really changed (as in academics or personality, etc). She agreed with my case, and, what do you know, she didn't even care! She said that she just wished I would have talked to her about it. I'm thinking, hell fucking yeah this is awesome!   And then I'm like, "So, why aren't you at the swim meet?" and she replies, "I only had to be there for the first half this time!" Damn.   And get this: at the end of the conversation, she's like, "So, are you gonna invite your friends back over here or what?" I just told her I'd have them pick me up, because, "I don't think they are gonna want to come back over here." And they came and picked me up.   So, I got in the car and told them about the conversation and they were like, "So you can still smoke?"   Yes, I can still smoke.
Two months ago my boyfriend broke up with me because he felt as though he didn't think I was the one or that we weren't meant to be. Despite that we had a great relationship. We were best friends that happened to be in love. However, I understood at the time that love isn't always enough and I accepted (begrudgingly) that he didn't think I was the one. Fast forward two months and he drunkenly drops a bomb on me. He's still in love with me and he specifically said that he felt like he might have ruined the best relationship of his life based on a hunch that I might not be the one. However, the next day he basically took it back. He said that he knows he's right about the future of our relationship but thinks he made a mistake about ending our relationship in the present moment. He says that he needs to take time to think about things, but we continue to see each other. He says the smart thing would be to stay apart but the emotional thing (for lack of a better way to phrase it) would be to get back together. He says he still has very strong feelings for me. Mind you, during this time we've been hooking up constantly since the break up and basically continued a somewhat-relationship without the label. In short, I'm confused. I don't want to sit here with an inkling of hope that we'll get back together when it could go either way. Should I just move on? I still love him and I know he loves me.
All I got is /kill @e[type=Item] but cannot find a way to specify what items get killed. For my purpose all I want to kill is a fire_charge which when killed by @e displays item.item.fireball
I was doing acid with my friend at the beach. We were staying with his 8 year old cousin and his really chill uncle. The first nigh we did shrooms and asked my friends cousin so pick out a movie with hope that he would pick out a really nostalgic movie. The kid delivers and we watch James and the Giant Peach. This movie was awesome but the next night when we did acid he choose Saw. It was horrible and we were too high on acid to figure out a way to convince my friends cousin to change the movie.
Used one this past weekend. Got on the plane, full full. The guy took my carry on with my charger in it and put it in the bin in row "god knows where" while I was in row 8. Plane rolls out and they close DIA. So we're on the tarmac for an hour, surfing, games, etc. Phone starts getting low. Then the pilot says we're headed back to the gate for an hour or two. I'm not going to dig through the plane for my bag just to charge my phone, so I pay the stupid thing. I was at 10% when I plugged it in, paid $3 and went and did stuff for 20 minutes, come back and my phone is so dead it won't even turn on.
I'm designing my first PCB with a trace antenna for NFC and am wondering which size, trace width and spacing are a good match.   The space I have for the antenna is around 30x18 mm. I used the [calculator]( over at ST.com and settled for 8 turns, 0.5mm trace width and 0.6mm spacing yielding 1.1µH inductance.   Question is if more turns actually better? I get a higher inductance but some people on the net say that more turns might not always be better.   Using a thinner trace width, it's easy to get a much higher inductance, but this is supposed to have other problems as well, or so I've heard. I've also heard that you're supposed to aim for an inductance between 1 and 5 µH, but I don't have a source for that.   Multi layered antennas are also a thing, but that is way above my level.   In the process I made an [online footprint generator]( with some basic js, if anyone is interested.
Ok.  So, I got an ION Audio TTUSB for graduation.  Before I get flamed, I wanted a decent entry-level TT, because I read the future of my little hobby and knew that some of the many variables in vinyl collecting/listening might eventually piss me off into abandoning it altogether.  I just got a Grado Black 1 cartridge and installed it.   At first, it sounded decent, until IGD showed up.  I tweaked and adjusted alignment.  Things got better/worse, and worse/better.  I played with the vinylengine "stupid protractor", but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.  At this point, I would give a shiny $20 to the first expert who can do it for me.  I'm very much a DIY'er, and maybe I'm overcomplicating a simple procedure, but it seems like there are SO many conflicting variables in getting a good cartridge alignment and sound.   WHAT AM I MISSING?  Anyway, I'm wondering; does anyone have experience taking their TT into a record shop and encountering a guru who can align and test carts like a boss?
I live with a dude at his house. He's cool, we get along.   Before that, a dude and his chick. We got along until the end.   Spent six weeks in a motel. Looooved it! But ...too expensive.   And then there was the psycho chick before that. I'd like to say that my mistake was sleeping with her, but she snaps on  everyone  eventually. Wow, just wow....   There was a house with 4 roommates plus me. It was all cool until people decided to adopt pets.   I lived up north with a chick. She was cool, but weird. And I returned home after six weeks.   Oh, before that was the townhouse with my best friend and his chick. Things were cool until ...pets.   Before all of that even was my apartment with my girlfriend!   Now we're at the beginning, where I grew up with siblings.
WARNING: Wall of thext ahead.   I never got into the nightly updates before, but yesterday I decided to give them a try.  I've been lurking the subreddit for a long time and wanted to check some of the new stuff.   I experienced my first crash in Starbound ever just trying to start it.  Remembering the suggestions here I delete starbound.config, the player and the universe folder.  I wasn't that attached to my old characters anyway.  Starbound starts.   I am welcomed by a new and cute chucklefish logo, and a new loading screen with an animated walking penguin.  At this point I realize I need to poop, go to the toilet, release brown chunks of anger there and come back.  The penguin is still walking, but it's nice and I'm not even mad.   Start screen appears after a while.  A frozen planet, a moon and some asteroids.  Nothing new here.  Let's make a new character.   To keep the "nightly" spirit, I decide to go for a night-black Hylotl.  Is it me or are there new fins and hairstyles?  I spend some time (longer than usual) trying to make my samurai fish look awesome and finally I can start.   The game starts, and NightShark appears before me in his heavily damaged spaceship.  Flickering lights, malfunctioning systems, broken hull...  Trying to go through my usual routine I try to open my locker just to be welcomed by a warning alarm.  I gess that won't do.   As I open my "Tech" computer I'm welcomed by a broken A.I. that spits numbers and errors at me.  Let's do this Windows style: If it doesn't work, reboot it.  The old Hylotl greets me and restores backup power.  Lights come back.  He activates my matter manipulator.  That fuel converter unit seems to be still malfunctioning, however, but my ship's thrusters can be fixed, according to S.A.I.L.  Time to go down to the planet, and get 2000 pixels and like 50 core parts to give the old fish teacher.   About time!  I open my locker, pick up everything, equipo my new sword and beam down.  To adventure!   A forest-like planet with brown dirt and green grass appears before me.  Trees have red foilage, and the sky has a pleasing orange feel.  I chop down enough trees to prepare my crafting table and enough rocks to get my first pickaxe.   While doing this, I get my first headcanon:  Stone tools work better than the Matter Manipulator to break down blocks, trees and stuff because they physically hit them, while the MM is some kind of telekinetic multi-dimensional system and it's bean is not meant to be used as a tool.  Makes sense, and makes me feel happy.   As usual, before going back to my ship and do everything I decide to explore a litte.  I see some new creatures.  A green bird with derpy face makes me go "oh god please no runrunrunrun" until I realize it's peaceful.  I also see the way it flies is nicer than usual and looks good.   I find some wildlife at some plains.  They jump slightly, doing a Sonic the Hedgehog-esque sound that makes me chuckle.  OH GOD WHY ARE THEY KILLING ME.  I realize I know nothing of the new combat system and keep trying to avoid them from touching me, even after realizing they don't touch-hurt you anymore.  I die.  Or rather, S.A.I.L. does some kind of last second teleport that burns some of my pixels.  O well.   After making a crafting table, a pickaxe, two fireplaces (one for cooking, one for my future furnace) and a hunting bow, I go down to planet surface again, to explore and get some new stuff.   It is at this point I realize books are broken:  I can only read the last bottom lines.  It seems they are still new all the time, but I understand this because I'm a stylish Hylotl and I keep my books in a perfect state, like new.  I don't know about the other races, though.  It might be a bug for them.  Oh well, I realize they haven't changed their message and move on.   Although it's useless, I check the pilot seat to see the new planet inteface.  It's way more useful, with information about planet climate an threats.  No meteors here, good.  The outpost out there, however, does have meteor showers.  I'm sorry for them.  Oh, and the moon has no O2.  M'kay.  I like this.   For the next minutes I try the new combat mechanics for two handed swords, and realize I can't just go around swinging my sword.  The blocking mechanics work nicely, but I have little experience with them and die several times.  It takes me several attempts before being able to run into a predator and feeling I can put up a fight.  I like the new attacks and I'm pretty sure I see some new monster parts, but they might just be parts I had never seen before.  Also, some monster coloring seems less intense and much more nature-oriented. I might just have been lucky.   After finding a 1-hand axe I realize how good those blocking mechanics are to keep myself alive.  Dead again.  However I'm pleased to see that axe as a secondary fire-based attack.  This means I can attack in two different ways and gives wielding a single-handed weapon with both hands an advantage.  Makes sense.   Upon dying I realize my ores drop.  I must have lost half of the coal available at this planet.  I just wish the ores actually dropped at my dying location to get them again instead of just vanishing, but oh well.  In a sense this is going to force me to plan better and avoid just carelessly walking around the planet.   But that will be done some other day, because I have to leave.  So far this is my experience:   BAD STUFF SO FAR: -Startup crash (easily solved) -Books are broken, cannot be read and are always "new"   GOOD STUFF SO FAR: -New character creation options. -New ships and their systems look nice.  Broken sship start gives a better "stranded" feeling, -S.A.I.L., I like you.  Let's make out. -Now I get a smooth teleporting animation, and things seem more fluid (my potato computer had its issues before) -Combat mechanics make combat fun and challeging, much more skill-based than button-mashed. -Creatures' attacks. -Droppin ores at death is an annoyance, but makes death much more meaningful. -Some new aestetic changes, found at creatures and some items like the bow and arrow. -The new ship navigation system is way better and more informative.   THINGS I'D LIKE TO CHANGE: -Upon "Normal" death ores could actually drop, instead of just disappearing, to be able to go on an expedition to find my lost materials.   MY OPINION SO FAR:  Having been away from starbound for a couple months this makes me realize how many new things we just got, and this is just the tip of the iceberg, there's much to find out.  I won't get annoyed at broken stuff for as long as it's not sold as finished, but I'm not blind to the fact that some more work is needed.  I still need to do much more to give a full review, however.  But I'm happy with the new stuff.   I'll keep you updated with my experiences as NighShark the dark Hylotl keeps adventuring.
It's interesting you bring that up, because we of course had Sam graded highly (regardless of whether we'd pick him or not) and when Ben had the 2nd rape accusation going, the deal for Sam was in place and we dropped out.   So we basically got a pretty damn similar situation, except without trading Ben;
Not tech related but I remember WAY back to HS, I had gotten out of practice a little early to go to work.  I went to the locker room, stripped down, showered, and then got dressed.  I bent down to tie my shoes to get going and I then noticed the other locker room door was wide open and a girl from my class was sitting on the stairs outside just watching me with a big grin on her face.  I asked her if she liked the show.  She giggled and said yes.  From then on, she blushed every time we passed in the hallway.
Top 5:   5.Fell into a pool, skinned the front of my leg from above my knee to my foot.  The skin came off so cleanly that it rolled up on the edge of the pool.  The chlorine in the water burned my fresh wound nicely.   4.Smashing my finger between a 600lb slab of concrete and a brick wall.  The new fingernail slowly pushed the old, dead fingernail out.   3.Being set on fire.   2.Friend pouring rubbing alcohol over my fresh second degree burns from aforementioned being set on fire.   1.Having my arm covered in 2nd degree burns while I worked my job in 90 degree heat.  Worked at a garden supply store as a mulch/dirt/stone/etc loader, mulch constantly got under the bandages and being generally scratchy.
don't let your unreliable roommates borrow them.   Don't know what the story is here, but I highly advise against this as well.  Many years ago, I returned from a week-long trip to find my car missing; turns out my (then) best friend/roommate had found my spare keys and been driving it around all week, then was too much of a dumbass to have it back when I returned.  Of course, didn't answer her phone or anything when this went down, so I called the cops assuming it had been stolen; turns out if you have given someone permission to drive it previously (even just once!), the cops can't do anything but issue an "Unauthorized Use of Motor Vehicle" warning.
Ok, I need some answers here.   I don't want to drive an hour to planned parenthood (pph) to be told to go home its normal..   Two years ago (as of November) I got an IUD from pph, (I am on a sliding scale due to cash-ola situation, so it was free.) I have never had kids, or abortions, or std's, or infections, and only one sex partner.   It was painful. Each period was like murder, I couldn't get out of bed for the first 2 days, and couldn't move quickly for three days before and after the two death days. Since then it has slowed to a dull roar. I can get along ok through the whole thing.. lots of Advil, and sometimes, but rarely Vicodin.   PROBLEM: About 6 months ago I started getting this pain. Anytime within a week radius of my period. I double over. It comes without warning. It feels like a stab in the middle of my cervix, then this knife like thing slides down my body to just outside my cha cha. It is SO distinct and powerful. The only thing I could imagine it being like, is a contraction..   String is still there. Good length. Not preggers. No weird things to report.   I just don't know what to do, if it's normal, and what is happening.
It's a long and sad story. This all happened in middle school and was between A and M. A is the bitchy 12 year old girl, and M is the mentally challenged 15 year old girl.   The story goes that A's father had an affair with M's mother. M's mother was a MILF because she had M at a young age, and people say A's father thought she was easy so he went after it. When A found out she lashed out at M by writing death threats that said, "I'm going to kill you" and "GO DIE." They were pretty simple since M couldn't read very well but she understood they were meant to hurt her.   She sent the letters to her in school, I don't know how she did it, but she was caught. There was a parent-teacher meeting to confront A, but that caused more drama. A's mom claimed that her daughter was being abused in school and the teachers were to blame for her outburst. I guess A's mom was lashing out as well for her husband's infidelity.   The school wanted A to apologize and suspend her for a few days. A's mom wasn't having it and made A transfer schools. It worked out since A was a known bully, especially to boys since she knew they couldn't hit her back. I remember the last thing my friend said on her last day at the school. She told him, "You're going to miss me," and he replied "What am I going to miss? A fat man with boobs?"
How dumb. Short of Murder and Rape, Burglary (especially at night) is pretty much the next worst crime that one can commit IMO. Maybe, maybe armed robbery is worse, but I don't think so.   It has extremely deep effects on the victim, think about it - their  home  has been violated. The amount of aforethought that goes into deciding to burgle a place is immense. Burglars are definitely not nice people, and there is far less excuse/justification potential for a burglar than almost any other type of criminal save a rapist.
Warning, gross)   I have tried, really hard, to get over my anxieties about sex.  It turns out that was an awful idea.   I was involved with a guy for about a year. He was kind of a slut before we dated, but he was an awesome and enthusiastic partner.  He got tested once and came back clean, but I wanted him to get tested again later because I was paranoid. He made a stink about me not trusting him, and he had no symptoms so I let it go. We used a condom every single time we had sex, no exceptions. We broke up at the beginning of October. Right before Halloween, I got a HORRIBLE primary outbreak of genital herpes.  It was unimaginably awful.  I had to miss an entire week of work, trying to go to the bathroom was something I could only do while up to my eyeballs in narcotic pain meds and even then it made me scream. My mom had to come out to visit me because I couldn't drive (because of the meds) or walk (because of the pain), so I got that humiliation added to my pain.   On top of that, my herpes sores got infected with Strep B, and I ended up in urgent care. While doing the exam, the speculum got stuck in my swollen tissue, and the woman YANKED IT OUT, causing me to rip and bleed for the next several days.  So I was leaking blood all over and stinging my herpes sores, constantly.  I am incredibly lucky that I didn't get blood Strep infection, all things considered. I had to be on an antibiotic AND an antiviral. My lymph nodes were so swollen that you could see the distorted skin.  The bend between my torso and my legs looked like a cartoon where you've filled a sack with bees. It was disgusting.   My intention had been to take the antiviral as a daily suppressant, but it started causing me to bruise very easily, and it was giving me these tiny purple spots (like a pin point bruise) all over my body, including my face, so I stopped taking it.   So all that sucked, and I have been slowly coming to terms with the fact that the "herpes talk" is a conversation I have to have with all my future partners, and that if I sleep with any partner long enough, chances are that they will get herpes.  Which means that whatever wonderful person I get married to is basically condemned to get herpes, especially can't I can't tolerate the suppressive medication long term.  Awesome.  But at least I don't have herpes all the time, and my junk at least looks fine.   And then this Friday, I had a mirror down by my junk to deal with a pimple, and noticed that I have warts.  Not just a little bit.  By flexing my stomach muscles, I can see large warts inside of my vagina.  I am so horrified and disgusted that honestly, I can't even think about it without having a panic attack. I'm going to the doctor on Monday to confirm, but honestly it's extremely obvious what it is. Yeah, yeah, I understand that a health immune system can clear the infection, but my immune system is far from healthy.  It's already taxed by my herpes infection, and I've always been a sickly person. I will probably have to get surgery to get them removed.   So basically, I managed to catch the two diseases that can't be reliably picked up on tests for men, and that you can't reliably be protected from with a condom, and that you can have for life.  I don't see a way I could have avoided getting these diseases other than not having sex. It's full circle to 6th grade sex ed.  Sex will make your genitals grotesque and sore ridden. Myth confirmed.   Now I don't know what I'm going to do.  As far as I can tell, my sex life from here on out is masturbating and blow jobs, but the last thing I want is to get these problems on my mouth as well, so honestly I don't know if even that is an option.  Given that my genitals are now basically the plague, I wouldn't date me and I don't know why anyone else with half a brain would either.
30 yr business consultant here. all the $ you pay to the bank or credit union is kept separate (goes to different accounts) you paid for up front their costs of financing you. on the loan itself they made 5 months interest. they were able to show your entire loan on their loans vs funds available metric, which is good.  they were able to show a payoff without default, which is good.  their receivables went down by the amount of the principal part of your payoff, which is bad for them because receivables is a banks most important means of remaining in business.  the interest portion of your loan in terms of monthly income to them went down and they can no longer show this as projected income.
passenger tried to warn the train crew about a large piece of metal coming up through the floor, instead of pulling the emergency brake himself. The train manager refused to stop the train until he had investigated the problem himself,   That's fucked up. Very poor decision skills for both, unfortunately driven by the community/government/law policies on blaming someone on an accident, and especially on how to cope with false alarms.   In other words, the first choice in dangerous situations should be made on the basis on "what's the safer choice for everybody (usually the conservative choice of pulling a brake or believing a passenger even risking to lose time)", rather than "what's the safer choice in case it's a false alarm (try to avoid to be sued or blamed for a false alarm)". Think about that: you see something going wrong. The first thing you think is if you have to position and authority to act, and what a burden is on you if you take action. This is fucked up. We should take back our ability to judge a situation and respond to a problem in a dynamic way, stopping this stupid bureaucratic self-reassuring excuse that "someone else above should do that". More in general, we should consider every choice we make our responsibility. If we let something wrong happen, it was  our  choice not to act. No excuses. Totalitarian governments always relied on this blind lazy way of hiding our responsibility behind law and hierarchy.
So I did Keto from January to May and made good progress, finally hitting my goal weight of 190 at the end of May (down from 240). I decided to indulge in some "forbidden fruit" which led to a subconscious decision to just take a break from keto altogether. So over the past few weeks, I found myself indulging a lot of "junk" food like cookies, donuts, fruits, sandwiches, etc.   Normally I would be really pissed off and feel like I "cheated" but here's the weird part, despite the overindulgence of carbs, I've actually been able to keep the calories to a minimum, to the point where I'm still losing weight. In fact, this morning I weighed in at 187. I think what happened is my stomach shrunk so much I'm just not that hungry in general anymore, regardless of what foods I eat.   For example, today I ate a bagel with cream cheese for breakfast, a chocolate chip muffin for lunch, and a small order of spicy salmon sushi for dinner. I'm stuffed right now, and that amounts to barely 1000 calories if I'm counting correctly.   I'm not advocating shitty diets, and I plan to get back on the clean eating wagon soon, I'm just curious why I'm still able to eat so much less while doing exactly the opposite of keto?
Quick summary, I had my first serious relationship with this girl, we fell head over heals in love with each other, planned for an amazing future together and lived together. She dumped me just before Christmas without much explanation at all and took all her things with her.   On the day she told me in the morning that she loved me, then in the evening when she left she said her feelings had changed, then she said she wanted to try, then she said she didn't know if she wanted to try, then she said she didn't want to try, then she said she has lost all her feelings for me.   Hearing all of that come out of a girls mouth who was running about the flat naked and ambushing me in the shower a couple days ago blew my mind. I didn't have a clue what to do and asked her to leave if she didn't have any feelings for me and didn't want to work it out. So she left.   My personal opinion on why she left based on how well I know her is she missed living with her parents, she missed the excitement of the build up before seeing me and she didn't like living with me. Not because I was horrible but I don't think she was ready to have that sort of change / commitment yet. When she moved in sex declined too, we went from having sex 3 times a day when we saw each other to once a week.   Either that or she had eyes for someone else.   I was crippled when she went, couldn't eat, couldn't think, couldn't sleep. I begged via email, she didn't reply. I called she didn't pick up. We didn't talk for about 10 days, then I texted her something light hearted about a TV show we used to watch. She responded right away and we made small talk via text. I then asked her to meet up for a walk, a walk where we spent some really romantic time together before.   She told me it would be nice but she didn't want to give me false hopes and although she thought moving out was the right decision.   I told her that she was right to move out and that clearly things changed but I'd like to still meet her with no strings attached to just have a nice time together with nothing heavy.   She said that sounded nice and we sorted out a time to meet.   All the while though the way she texted was different, it's all like texting someone you've just met. There was no emotion, none of our intimate little inside jokes that we always made. It feels so very strange! This is a girl who told me she loved me every day and every night.   If I see her my aim is to just be myself, be calm and have a bit of fun. To basically try and show her how things were before she moved in and how good we are together. Basically I want to remind her of how great we were together not by explaining but by doing. Which as far as I know if she was confused may show her the light if that makes sense.   However I am well aware that she may well really have lost all her feelings for me, I couldn't really believe this as a possibility because the love she had for me was seriously strong. I mean she was over the moon. How that could disappear was beyond me but it does happen! I also know she said I shouldn't have false hopes, but she told me nothing else matters beyond us being together the day before she left! So I mean clearly there is evidence that she is a little confused.   So my question now reddit is should I actually meet her?   I'd really like to have a crack at fixing things by taking it slow, dating from scratch basically because we really were perfect together until she moved in and things changed form passionate to a bit more adult and mundane. However I just wonder if this may be a waste of time and lead to more heart break which will slow me down from moving on with my life and meeting a potential new partner.
I apologize in advance for this rambling self post. I’ve been trying to piece these thoughts together for a while, and I wanted to get them out there for other to comment on. I also want to preface this by saying that I really appreciate the folks in this community and have felt welcome here since I got on reddit just a short time ago. It's been tremendously valuable for me to be able to hear about so many people's experiences as I try to be the best partner I can be to my girlfriend. And, whatever happens, I’m not trying to start a big shitshow... though I’m aware of that as a possibility. :/   IRL, I run a drop-in group for high school aged queers. Almost all of them are still in a place where they’re constantly questioning their gender and/or sexual orientation in some way. Their average age is 15.   Because they are so young and so isolated from queer communities, a lot of them come to the group with no information about what the “correct” way to talk about gender identity and sexual orientation is, or even that there are better and worse ways to talk about this stuff. And yet they have very brave conversations about these issues, learn from each other, and support each other.   As far as I can understand, the key difference between that group and this subreddit is not that the kids are less jaded than we are, or that their group meets face to face, or that their issues are less difficult than ours.  It’s that  they approach each conversation assuming that everyone else is acting with good will.   Now back to reddit. I understand that language matters and shapes how we think about concepts. However, I also think that the content of what someone is saying is more important than the words they use to say it.   For example, OP in [this thread]( is a young trans guy asking for support and tactics to survive/wait out this part of his life. ZoeBlade made an encouraging [comment](  to the effect that T will really help others see him for who he is. Svanhvit piled on and added that transitioning in the FtM direction is often easier than the MtF direction, which was topical since this subreddit frequently discusses trans women’s experiences with and fears of being misgendered. Then her language was corrected and that whole thread went to hell.   Yes, she used the word “women” to refer to pre-transition trans men. But does anyone here really think she was trying to state that trans men are women?   I’m not trying to say that it was bad to correct her language. If catamorphism hadn’t done it, someone else probably would have. I’m just sad that a thread that started out so supportive and positive got so ugly when folks were just trying to contribute, with absolutely no ill intent.   A related thought - there seems to be a belief in many queer communities (including r/lgbt, r/asktransgender, and whatever that damn more-trans-than-thou blog is) that if other people use different language than you do to describe their queerness and/or experience their queerness differently, it reflects back poorly on you. (Common example: hostility and disgust that some gay men have towards femmy/faggy/stereotype-fitting gay men). I get that this comes from being constantly made to defend our identities, but it troubles me that we can’t switch off when speaking to each other in spaces that are supposed to be safe ones. Could we find a balance point that allows us to express what words we prefer without saying that the words others use to refer to themselves are wrong?
Last week I was hanging out with a few close friends.  There are five of us plus one of my friends had invited his sister, cousin and two other friends.  We spent most of the day drinking together then headed out to the clubs that night.  Everybody had a great time all around and it was fun hanging out with the others who usually do not hang out with our group & stick to their own circle of friends.  I spent a little time talking to his cousin throughout the night and she seems pretty cool - I'd like to talk to her more and possibly see if she'd be interested in going out sometime but I'm not really sure if It's appropriate or if I should forget about it since It's my friend's cousin.   I did approach him about the possibility and he told me he didn't have any problem with it with regards to his cousins since he knows I wouldn't be "that asshole", however his sister is off limits (which was obvious without it ever having to be said.)  I'm still hesitant however because people in our close group have talked before (long ago,) about not liking the idea of going after close friend's cousins and we all seemed to agree it wasn't really a cool thing to do.   Another worry I have is what would happen if we did start seeing each other and a fight or break up happened down the road. I'm pretty close with his parents and his sister as well, spending a lot of time at their place and being invited out on "family events/trips" by him and his parents many times.  I wouldn't want something to ruin that.   I don't feel like I have any sort of future with this girl unless something drastic happened if I decide to talk to her, but I do think this is someone I'd like to talk to and at least keep in contact with.   I've thought this through inside and out but I'm still a little confused as to what I should do because of the points above.
One of those bastards once peed on my hand ten years ago. since then I've devoted my life to finding this fellow. I will have my revenge.
Then the waiter learns nothing.  Reading your last line I immediately think of you as someone who is cheap, who doesn't want to tip anyway and is looking for any excuse to not tip (the kitchen fucking up your food, for instance, is not a reason to fuck over the waiter).   Or you can pay the $3-4, and teach a life lesson that will never be forgotten.   In an entire night,  maybe  one table won't tip.  On most shifts no one stiffs their waiter.  I'm talking about the entire restaurant of a dozen servers, 150 tables, no one stiffs.  If you stiff, you'll be remembered.   I've heard of a waiter having the cook spit in a tables food because the family stiffed his friend 2 years prior at a different restaurant.   Personally I'd never stiff a waiter.  If someone did something like this to me I'd inform the host I'd like to talk to a manager, the manager would probably fire the waiter on the spot and I'd let a new waiter kiss my butt for the rest of the meal and tip them well.   All not tipping does is prove you're an asshole.  Managers will ask servers if the customer tipped when fielding customer complaints.  If the customer didn't tip, the manager doesn't take the complaint seriously.  The manager will justify to themselves that the customer is just an asshole who doesn't want to tip.  It's a ton easier than firing a waiter, hiring a new one, training them, and the hours of paperwork involved.   People are lazy in their thinking.  Not tipping makes you look bad, makes you lose credibility, lets the server get away with it.  And the server here lost out on what?  $3.50.  Big deal.  I'd pay $5.00 to rip on you right to your face.
There seems to be a lot of people here claiming that science gives us the truth. However, one of the fundamentals of modern science is that you can never claim anything to be the absolute truth. The only thing science provides you with is the most logical and rational explanation for our problem at the current time. To give an example, no serious scientist would ever say that the theory of evolution is the truth. For all we know it might be aliens with stealth technology changing our genome to troll us, or other people say it's God. However we don't have any observations that supports any of those events and there is also no way for us to prove them wrong at the moment, thus as rational human beings we don't call it science... yet, who knows what the future brings.
I was in the same situation. I went with Dembélé (decent price).     Dembélé has been in the starting lineup for the last six premier league matches, although he hasn't played for full 90 minutes in the last 5 gw.     Chadli on the other hand has only played total for 66 minutes in the last 4 gw. I wouldn't bet on him playing much in the next two games.     Lamela is a good choice but more expensive than Dembélé. I think you get more points/price for Dembélé     Townsend has only played once in the last 4 gw. Too risky IMO
First post here, so be gentle please. :P) So to start off here, I recently joined this band after they went through some problems keeping a guitarist in the group, for one reason or another. Since getting together with them, we've been working on some new material for the group, as well as redoing some of the earlier songs for the fans who have been around longer, to enjoy a new taste of the older songs. This song falls under the latter category, and will be released on an upcoming album in 2013. We're still working on some of it, but for the most part, it's a done deal, it's just needing a little fine-tuning here and there, nothing a little more recording won't fix. Anyway, give it a gander, and let me know what you think. Any feedback is highly encouraged. :)
First of all, This is not a situation where WetVapes "should have done something", and Its not completely my fault for not realizing something could be done. I just want to give them props to their great customer service.   So exactly one month ago, I ordered the Crius tank (the first of the batch with the Velocity posts). I got the tank, and I really liked the flavor and vapor I was getting once I got the wicking down. The issue I was having was that my AFC ring seemed to move up and down just a hair. It didnt really bother me, but I was getting leaking out of the top of the AFC and the bottom of the plastic that holds the tank in place. At first, I would catch it, wipe it off, and write it off to "RTA Problems" because I really didnt think it was enough to matter... until I took it out of my house with my one day and ended up with liquid in my pocket. At that point, I just decided it was best to not use it outside the house because I have other tanks I can take with me and it wasnt worth the possibility of it leaking enough to ruin the device it was attached to. So I sent WetVapes an email just saying "Just as an FYI", "I realize this is not your fault because you dont make the tank", "I am not complaining", and "I dont expect anything, seriously, and you will not lose my business regardless of the outcome." I got an email back from them and they are sending out a new base because that seems to be where the issue is.   Props to WetVapes. They didnt have to do anything for me and I really didnt expect them to. I don't know what their return policy is, but regardless, this could have easily been written off because I had the device for so long. Granted, it was like this when I got it, but they could have easily said that it isn't their problem.
reading through the comments, I would like to share a recent TED talk about how the "West" has flourished, leaving the rest of the world behind.   It basically shows what the west did, and what other countries like China and India are doing, and what the starving people in low income countries should start doing.   And since you are a five year old, please don't use the term "third world". It is quite irrelevant as it was coined in the Cold war era, separating the first world (large capitalist democracies like the Allies of WWII), second world(communist states Soviet Russia and co.) and other countries (neutral, colonies, not significant world powers).  Hans Rosling (Swedish statistician, knows a lot about public health and stuff) recommends using a measurable label like income (low-income, middle-income, high-income countries).
I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel. I can't play until further notice. I practice at least an hour every day so this sucks. Luckily, the doctor says we caught it early and I should be able to recover without surgery. My dad, who has played for over thirty years had it too. He couldn't even finish a song without going numb. He got surgery and is able to play again but says he is nowhere near as fast as he once was. Learn from my mistakes, don't push yourself too hard. If anyone is interested in the exercises I have to do to rehabilitate my hand (maybe you'd like to do them to prevent getting carpal tunnel), let me know and I'll scan and post my instructions. Anyone else ever dealt with this?
Ok, this is plain horrifying. What shocks me is not the 'removal of death penalty' part, but the context in which he is saying these things and the way he has framed it. He clearly thinks that this is an electoral issue, and he is trying to scare up some votes. This, though, is happening in one of the least developed, most unsafe states!  I think I'm doing a bad job of expressing my outrage, but what I'm trying to say is that this choot thinks rapist-appeasement is a viable strategy for elections??? When 6 rapists are hanged, should this be an issue that 6 crore vote for?   The current precedent for rape judgement is, I believe ideal for India. First offence is not death, numerous offences will take you to the gallows. In a system where the police are more of a problem than the solution, we need such deterrents for the repeat offenders.  In his 140 char upadesh, Mulayam ji has neglected to mention any of this nuance, just that 'Ladkon se galti ho jati hai'. Really????
This.  You need to check the code for your residence.   I had a similar story from when I built a fence on my property.  The law stated it MUST be at least 6 inches away from the property line so we built it 8 inches.  My neighbor decided to put up his own fence after we did and the cock sucker just nailed his to ours and "stole" 8 inches of property.   I contacted the local law enforcement and they couldn't force him to remove his fence that was nailed into ours or cite him for property damage because of it.  I went up to the courthouse and researched zoning laws regarding fences in my area and the law changed to 10 inches by that time.   I took him to court and he didn't show up so I obviously won.  He was also on the hook for $500 in damages to my fence and the judge doubled it since he didn't show up.  I saw him start to build his fence backwards to piss me off so I put up no trespassing signs on my fence and the police officer who lived across the street told him he'd have to stay off the property.  This made him install the fence the proper way and then the bank took his home 3 years later.   edit:  Some people were asking, he wasn't always an ass hole.  I don't know why he became one but I wasn't putting up with it.  I've helped out the neighbors on both sides of my home plenty of times over the past 15 years.  This ranges from shoveling snow on their sidewalks to picking up trash in their yards so it doesn't get stuck in their bushes or down the gutters.   I asked him if he needed help putting up his fence prior to him putting it up and he declined.  He told me he was planning on stopping about 10-12" from my fence then run it parallel to my fence and stop on the corner of his garage.  I went to bed and woke up and he used about 40, 5 inch nails and secured it to my post.  Yes.... 40, 5 inch nails and he completely fucked up that post when he tore them out.  He did this because he only used 2 posts instead of the 3 + 1 corner so it would stay up.  He thought he would anchor it to my post that was done right, poured concrete into it to secure it.   Anyways, I had to spend money and time to replace that corner piece he wrecked and his fence that he put up fell down after his home foreclosed.  It fell into his yard because the base wasn't secured in the ground and the wind and rain tore out the base over time.   Re Edit:  For anyone who is saying I was clearly wrong, I'll save you the time.  He damaged my property and the police told me to file a suit and noted the damages in the police report.  This is no different than someone kicking a huge dent into your car and saying tough.
So, I was browsing reddit, and I found this comment in  this one thread  and that was about the end of our friendship. I have a hard time doing good deeds for people after what happened   And it reminded me of something that happened:   So, senior year in high school me and a friend both got Skullcandy headphones for Christmas. We both wanted a pair from the Skullcrusher series, but she got a pair from the... it was either the Shoe or Hesh series. So, we would trade headphones for the first few periods of the class day (we both had study hall at some point in time before lunch), then at lunch we'd trade back.   Anyways, one day we traded and when I slid the headphones over my ears, the left ear cup just spontaneously broke.   I tell my friend what happened, I apologize profusely, and I tell her she can hold on to my skullcrushers until I buy her a new pair.   Again, that was senior year in high school. I am now a sophomore in college. I've yet to buy her a new pair, but I've come across money enough to buy myself things (swords for a collection, my laptop, videogames, etc).   So, am I scumbag steve?   NOTE: My skullcrushers were in... okay condition. They were collapsible, but this one little notch that would lock the headphones together snapped off. Did nothing to the audio, but they just looked weird on the head because of it.
I was hoping to start a discussion about the funny position of being a fan of a club rather than a fan of football. I feel that it's a trap people have a big tendency to fall into.   Even though my flair is that of a team back home in Iceland, I've been an Arsenal fan since I was 6 years old. I picked the team because I was bored of the Manchester United support in my home and they had a cool name. I didn't pay much attention to the sport for about 5 years or so when we finally got the channel that broadcasted the Premier League.   The opener was Arsenal-Middlesbrough, a brilliant game in hindsight but I remember running into my room incredibly mad because the score was 1-3 in Middlesbrough's favour. About half an hour later my father called my back into the TV-room to show me that the score was now 4-3 so I started watching again and was delighted that my team won.   Now I realize that in doing this I was being a "bad fan" of my team but honestly I just couldn't stand the idea of them losing and I've been almost like that for so long. So many weekends ruined because my team lost games they should've won or got crushed 8-2 or something like that.   Then I decided to distance myself from my team a bit and just watch games that seemed interesting to me and try to enjoy the sport to it's fullest. You wouldn't believe what a difference it was to be able to sit and enjoy a team's style of play, free of the hate I'd developed for almost every single team that wasn't Arsenal. I'd even actively avoid Manchester United games since Robin left Arsenal for them and went on to win the Premier League.   Players put on the Arsenal shirt and they became heroes, I'd adore them, put unrealistic faith in their ability and loyalty and when they decide to make a personal decision for their benefit I'll cast them aside like they never meant anything to me.   Players, managers, board members come and go, the club is forever. Should the fans be always support their club, even if everything that made them fans is gone?   Basically with this thread I was hoping to spark some discussion about how being a fan of a particular club can affect a person's relationship with a simple sport so much and if you don't support any club I'd like to hear about what that's like.   I'm not trying to tell you that supporting clubs is pointless, it's brought me immense joy but personally I grew tired of the rollercoaster about 2 years ago. Maybe I just want to know how to cope. Football is a great sport but I've almost ruined it for myself by being to dead set on a particular team.
About a month ago, I came out as transgender to my mom after a few months of NC. She initially seemed very supportive, so I started talking to her a bit more. I was even considering moving back home, mostly to be closer to my teenage sister who still lives with her. Today, NMom asked me to call her because she "wanted to talk to me," so I did.   I started out trying to tell her that I finally have plans to relocate closer to home, which I'm totally stoked about, and she interrupted me. Strike 1. She started literally crying (again) about how the fucked up living situation SHE got herself into keeps getting worse and worse. Strike 2. I  almost  let it slide.   Then she said "I don't know what to do... [birth name], [preferred name], whatever" and I was 120% done. I flipped out on her (again), reminding her (again) exactly how and why HER situation is HER fault (again). She can't see past the reality she's built around herself, insisting she's "disabled" and "can't work" because she's too "fat" or "old" or "ugly" (yes, those are her  actual  excuses) to work. Which is how she ended up living with a "friend" who's tired of her doing nothing and telling her to leave.   Anyway, I told her off and she hung up on me, which is kind of a surprise because she's disgustingly co-dependent on me and has said multiple times that "[she] can't live without [me]" so she usually just puts up with me. I was legitimately impressed that she worked up the nerve to cut me off.   She promptly ruined it by sending me an email, claiming she "accidentally pressed a button" and "it doesn't do any good to keep kicking [her] about what [she] can't change." Then another. I'm just laughing at this point.
My partner (known for 13 years; best friends for 7 years; dating 15 months) and I had a fight last night and he left to stay at his brother's house as we both needed some space. His younger sister (18 y/o; 6 years younger), who has obviously (to me) disliked me from the beginning, is visiting the family, and is also staying at their brother's.   My partner came home today and we talked things through, are now trying to patch things up, and get back to where we were before. There was a party on tonight that we were both invited to, and were going to be spending the night there, however he told me that he would like to go alone, and I said that was fine as I am sick anyway. Tonight he was texting me letting me know that he was was a bit drunk and having fun; as the time got later, the texts were less coherent, so I asked him to repeat a few things, but in a different way so I could understand. I also asked him if he was at the party, or at his brother's house as he had mentioned that he did karaoke with his sister.   I didn't get a reply for hours and figured he had passed out/ gone to bed.   I then received a text from his sister using his phone.   The text said that he was "with his SISTER" who is "more capable" than me at "taking care of him".   When he had been texting me earlier, he had told me he had been using Snapchat to send pictures and videos to his sister's new boyfriend. I asked him in response how many he sent, and what the content was, as he doesn't like the boyfriend, which she isn't aware of, and I was worried that the snaps may have been offensive or rude.   In her text she tells me that he can message her boyfriend to say whatever he wants (she doesn't realise that he dislikes him) and that it is none of my business. She also said that he is happy and doesn't need me interrupting his night, as she hasn't seen him this happy since he has been with me; however she lives in a different state over 3700m away from us and has seen us in person 3 times, so it's reasonable for her to not have seen him as happy, or happier with me.   Later she sent a text message from his phone stating that she "doesn't give a shit" about me, that she "hates me", is "not going to pretend to like me anymore", and "doesn't give a shit" about how I'm going to "treat her because of it".   I have always been nice, friendly, welcoming, and respectful to her, however after this, I don't want to be. I will continue to do so though for my boyfriend.   All I can think is that she is trying to ruin our relationship!   I don't know what to do! I have been a lurker for about 2 years now and love this community so I thought I would ask for advice.
I would say it hurts your overall League performance on Summoner's Rift. My logic:     High percentage skill-shot hits (inflated confidence etc.)   Lack of coordination and communication   Lack of objective control   Lack of how Summoner's Rift works/plays   Unrealistic builds and expectations   Opponents not "try-harding"   Low punishment for mistakes     In terms of mechanics, I would say it offers a good-ish amount of practice but how well that translates is limited. To be honest, it's not a bad way to learn a champion's kit (granted it is random who you get so you could be waiting a while to get even a single game), but it won't set you up for success on Summoner's Rift.
And I do mean EVERYONE in my team loses in EVERY GAME besides me. I'm the ONLY player that can hold the ground. I'm Gold 2 now being dropped from 2k. I don't know what to do, I have never seen anything like this before and I've played quite a lot of rankeds.   [The game that brought me down to Gold t2 in 16 minute mark](
Sorry for the long post, I'm in a bit of a panic currently. I was on a night out last night, and my card was stolen. I realised pretty soon after and immediately called up my bank to cancel the card and have a new one sent to me. However when I checked my account this morning £180 was withdrawn 9 minutes before I had called up to cancel my card. Is there any way I will be able to get that money back? I'm going to the bank tomorrow to get some money out, but is there anything I can do to claim back the money? I definitely didn't take it out myself, and I had sobered up by this point. Thanks for any advice :)
So after you eat your delicious cereal of choice, you get to drink that delicious cereal milk (that tastes like your cereal at the end). Which was great for me since I don't like milk outside of cereal and my mom was always on me to drink it as a kid. Around 1995 I came up with the idea to sell already flavored cereal tasting milk... To this day I think its a good idea but haven't looked for it.
dude. wat. the article says nothing of that nature (or, what you're implying--which if I read you correctly is that you are misreading/not reading the article and going on to assume that the ecofeminists blame men specifically (some do, some don't))--the ecofeminists are (generally) simply all about drawing parallels between how women were exploited and how the environment currently is in the process of being exploited. there  are  variants of ecofeminism, just as there are variants of feminist ideology--some are more ardent in their convictions than others, some want to go all the way and be belligerent and incisive and blame men for all the shit all the time.   now, I dislike the current popular brand of feminism as much as any other dude on here...but what you said, based on improper assumptions, simply isn't really legitimate. yes, I agree, ecological damage  is  mostly caused by obnoxious consumerism...but assuming women contribute mostly to that damage is some nonsense on stilts--everyone should be changing their consuming habits, not just women; men can be just as bad (esp. if you're a rich-ass motherfucker). we all contribute in our own, special, fucked-up way to the disease of the environment we are just now realizing is a thing, regardless of how long you keep your clothing or how many times you re-use it.
I'm not going to go into details about the breakup itself, as it has nothing to do with what happened over the past three or four days.   We had been in a rocky period since about two Wednesday's ago, but we kept talking it out and realizing both of us wanted to still be with each other in some form. For a while, it felt just awkward, but last Monday, I spent the night with her for the first time in a long while.   It felt amazing.   It was the first time since breaking up that I could feel a connection between us like it was just magical. We kissed, held hands, cuddled, watched Breaking Bad and just felt like a regular couple again. I loved it, and I could see on her face she did too.   But then Wednesday, she acted weird. She was being very off, and she finally admitted that she's been questioning her sexuality as of late, and that she was confused. I was aware of her ex-girlfriend, but I didn't care, because I have no reason to be bothered by anyone who is bi or gay. I made that clear to her then, and when she told she thinks she's bi. I meant it when I told her I wanted to support her, but then said she wants to try being with girls to see if she can be happy like she was with her ex-girlfriend.   That fucking killed me inside, and it still does.   The next day, we go back to being flirtatious, but she's noticeably more reserved when it comes to nicknames and stuff. I knew what was happening, but didn't want to admit it (and still don't). The topic isn't talked about again until tonight, where she says she told her mom and one of her sisters today about her sexuality.   Long story short, they're down with it, But, she's already talking to girls to go on dates with. Although I already knew the answer, I asked if she was even interested in trying to date me again. She said, "I don't know. I'm sorry." It bothered her to see me like this, because she kept wanting me to respond. (Not in angry ways, but like, "Please respond. Please just talk to me.") It soon shifted, and I said something that came off  way  worse than my intention, so she blocked me on everything except for texting.   Things blew up, she called me at work, and the last thing I'll ever hear from her voice was, "Fuck you, Joel."   We did somewhat smooth things out for a bit afterwards, where she said that regardless of the situation, she still wants to hear me and have me in her life. I  know  what y'all are going to say, but she meant what she said. Even if it doesn't happen, she still wants me there somewhere. She's made that clear three times now, when she never had to. It never felt forced. It never felt like she was doing that to try and win me back.   But unfortunately, I get home and text her very briefly and awkwardly about small things, when she says she no longer wants to even be my friend. She says that I have proven to her it can't happen because there will always be tension -- and she'll never unblock me from anything.   So, this fucking sucks. I feel like I'm living in the stone age with the girl I love. I don't know anything about her from this point on. I don't know who she dates, who she meets, etc. I'm so depressed and feel like the shittiest person in the world. Everything I did was for nothing.   And you want to know the best part of it all? I'm a fucking virgin. She always told me she was a highly sexual person, which I loved, and got to partially experience. It was neat. But we never had sex. And I know it's such a minute thing, but goddamnit it bothers me we never did. We got  so close ,  so  many times, and now, she'll find someone better than me and get to have sex all the time with them. Why the fuck does this bother me so much, Reddit? Please help me.
I can't speak for all fiverr gigs, but I did book covers on there. NEVER. AGAIN. Cheap customers are the worst. They would give me shit ratings for not finishing their project when they never responded to what I gave them, or never even told me what they want. The authors were very fucking condescending, and would send back every project.   Out of the 20+ gigs I did before just not dealing with that stress any more, maybe 4-5 of those customer were reasonable and polite.   I told someone that cheap customers are the worst and they asked me why people begging you for free work weren't worse than cheap guys. I told them that at least the favor gigs fucking appreciate you.
So my family is "disappointed" with my "lack of eating" and "anorexic" behavior. Here's the thing, i'm a senior in high school and have always had 0 confidence in myself, and was overweight, not obese but overweight. I am 6 ft and I weighed 192 lb so nine weeks ago I decided to change that, I began going to the gym and completely changed my diet. I haven't had soda or fast food in 9 weeks and have been eating 3 meals a day and drinking plenty of water. By doing this I have gone from 192 lb to 163 lb and now my family wants me to completely give up on this lifestyle because I am being unhealthy. Do you think that what I am doing is unhealthy? I have only began working out and dropping bad food from my diet. I am getting no support and it's kind of hard to continue working out with no one telling me they are seeing improvements or that i'm doing a good job. I THINK I am seeing improvements, could you let me know if you think you are too? Sorry for posting all this and i'm sure you've all ehard stories like this before but I just need someone to tell me that i'm not wasting my time and slowly killing myself.
Personally I would rather they just put it back to ALL random, no consistency and call it a day. I say this everytime a post like this comes up, Hi-Rez can NOT win with this game mode. People are always pissed off about it. Also you claim you claim you understand the concept of random but get made at people who are "pointing out the obvious" when you are in fact complaining about the obvious. It is random, end of story. If they wanted to make the teams balanced then it wouldn't be the same game mode. As someone else said, they broke the healer rule because every day there were bitchy complaints about "lack of healers".
I'm not an expert in this area by any means, but I'll attempt to inform you with valid information that could aid in answering your question. I don't actually answer your question, so don't get too excited. However, I do hint at where the answer might lie.   Well, the first thing you should know is that we do not "see" anything with the eyes; we see with the [visual cortex]( which is seated towards the back of the skull.   To put it as simply as I understand it, [photoreceptor cells]( convert light into biological signals, and these signals manage to find their way to the visual cortex. The visual cortex processes these signals, and you wind up being able to see.   If you don't have functioning eyes, your visual cortex doesn't receive any signals to process, and if your visual cortex is not functioning, there isn't anything to process what signals you  do  receive. Both cases result in blindness.   The second thing you should know is how our eyes convert light to biological signals. We do this with two types of photoreceptor cells: [cones]( and [rods]( Cones focus on what colors we see, and rods focus on whether or not there is a change in color. I could go further into the [density of rods and cones on the retina]( but the one you want to be concerned with are the cones.   So, there are three kinds of cones in humans, with each type responding to either the "red", "blue", or "green" wavelengths of visible light, respectively. On average, there are around 4.5 million cones on the retina, with the number of cones per individual varying anywhere from [4.08–5.29 million](   Since individuals DO have significant variance in the number of cones they have (9% less or 17% more than the average), and cones convert light into biological signals, it isn't impossible that the visual cortex of the brain receives more signals about RGB colors as the number on the retina increases, and that more cones might lead to more signals received by the visual cortex of x color. This does NOT necessarily mean we see a "stronger" color as the number of signals for a color increases.   The third thing you should know is that I have absolutely no clue on how the visual cortex processes the signals created by photoreceptors. Remember, we  see  with this part of the brain; our eyes transfer what light they receive into biological signals, and the visual cortex interprets these signals, somehow giving us sight. I have no clue on how the visual cortex process these signals, and as such, I can't give you an answer to your question.   I can, however, say that your question is probably asking the following:   Are the signals received by the visual cortex translated into different colors for different individuals? Can the same type of signal be seen by one individual as a "green", while being seen by another individual as a "blue"?   Anyways
Background: I am a 24 year old working on a PhD. I am taking six courses this term and am generally easy going but I feel pretty stressed inside.   I have been dating my boyfriend over two years. He moved with me for my grad program and is the only one of us who has a car (I got in a bad accident a couple years ago and couldn't afford to get a new one). He has also been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome by a psychiatrist.   Problem: I know this will sound like a serious first world problem, but I am unhappy in the relationship. Since October he only wants to have sex once to twice a week at most and those times usually last ~5 minutes if I had to guess. Most nights we just come home from work/school respectively, he watches Magic the Gathering videos or his shows for four hours, then he passes out immediately. I've told him I'm interested in having sex more often (I've said this for about 6 months) and nothing changes, including if I initiate.   He goes to Friday Night Magic every week, and is good at it. He won last week for example. This weekend he's going to a tournament Saturday and a tournament Sunday, and both will last around 12 hours. I asked him if it was OK if he didn't go to Magic the weekend after this big tournament weekend since it was going to be a super stressful week for me since I have 2 presentations, and at first he said fine, but then he flipped out.   He essentially said, "Everyone else is so excited to go to tournaments over the summer, but I know I won't get to because you won't let me and you never go home when you are on break." I think I've been really cool about supporting him pursuing his hobby, but today he said he should be playing 7 days a week and should never have to skip a weekend. It just sort of makes me sad that he doesn't look forward to spending any quality time with me (that doesn't include hours sitting next to each other at our respective computers).   I read a study somewhere that said that 80% of marriages that have one partner with Asperger's and one who does not have it end in divorce. I'm at my wits end. Please someone give me some insight.. I feel like I'm going crazy. Am I being unreasonable? I would try to get out of the house more, except we live in a suburb 15 minutes outside of the city with no sidewalks and a busy highway right next to our subdivision.
I made a post a week ago about why casual is dead. I had a half hour today and decided to try out the nerfed R8.   A player on the other team was outfragging by 4x the next highest score. His shots were fishy, whatever, vac will get him eventually. Here is the kicker, he has nametags on his guns with cheat sites. So to me thats enough, hes hacking. REGARDLESS he is advertising sites that have a huge negative impact on the game.   So I switch teams and start explaining why we need to kick. He only has one friend on the team so it should be easy to get rid of this shit. NO. apparently people love playing with cheaters, protecting them, saying im fucking stupid for even trying to get this poison removed.   So after a few failed kick attempts they kick me.
I worked for my local cable company as a field technician for four years. I have seen, and dealt with many strange things, and weird people over that very short period of time. This is a story of one crazy woman I had to deal with.   This story starts with me receiving a work order to an apartment complex because a customers internet service wasn't working. I knocked on the door and a very intoxicated woman answered the door. I am sure many of you have heard the term, rode hard and put away wet. Well, this woman almost fit this description, except they didn't bother to put her away. She had just been rode hard and left out to weather. The sad thing is, one could see, that once upon a time she had been a very pretty woman. As this woman swayed back and forth with drink in hand, she apologized for being drunk. I told she had nothing to apologize for since she was drinking in her own home. I then ask her to show me her modem so I can start to fix her problem. While I was starting the trouble shooting process, she asked if I wanted a gin and tonic. I politely decline. She then asks if I would like to party with her and that she has any type of pill I could want. She then starts to list off a whole pharmacopoeia of pills that she had. Once again I politely decline.   Next thing I know, she was next to me and, trying to rub up on me. She informed me that that she couldn't wait to get her web cam back up. As she said that she flashed me her deflated pancake titties. As quickly as I could I finished that job and high tailed it out of there.   Fast forward one week later. My pager goes off and I receive my afternoon service calls. As I am scrolling through my calls I recognize an address, sure enough it's pancake titties. I called one of my coworkers who was working as a floater that day and ask if he would be willing to accompany me on the call. I quickly gave him the run down of my last encounter at that address. He said sure and he would be right over.   We Knock on her door, once again she answers the door with drink in hand, swaying back and forth. She squealed with delight and said "You're back, and you brought a friend too! We can have a threesome!" My friend shot me a WTF look,I shot back with the I told you so look.   This time she was dealing with tiling on her digital boxes on a number of channels. We started trouble shooting the problem. Before we know it she was trying to grope us and grab our crotches. We kept swatting her hands away from us and asked her politely to keep her hands to herself. She disappeared into the other room, so we figured she got the message. About a minute later she came back, butt ass naked holding up one condom package and, loudly proclaimed " I need to be fucked!" We grabbed our gear and said we fixed the problem and walked out the door. We went to the main cable junction box and hooked her up with the most amount of signal that we could. I called my dispatch and supervisor and gave them the rundown on what went on at that call. I had them flag that address so they wouldn't send any other techs out there by themselves.
Disclosure: it's my first time, be gentle.   So I picked these up from the vape store after sampling them out of some T3s. They tasted pretty flavorful in those tanks so I was excited to get home and drip them to get the full effect. First up was Lemon Cheesecake.   I loaded some new cotton in my .4 dual coil Stillare, put in a fresh VTC5, juiced it up and fired away.   Lemon Cheesecake Flavor: Immediately I got the sweet fresh taste of lemons. Not the overly tart kind of lemon flavor like you get with lemonade juices, but rather the more subtle sweet kind, like you typically find with lemon pastries. As I released the fire button and continued to inhale the cooling of the coils gave off a nice cream like flavor as I finished my draw. On the exhale the flavor of the graham cracker crust could be noted but did not over power the lemon custard like flavor. It was honestly one of the best cheesecake juices.   Thai Mango Sticky Rice Flavor: Have you ever tried juices that are REALLY good and you want to tell all your friends about them but you constantly are thinking "this is amazing, but how the hell do I describe it to them". Well, this is the poster child for those juices. I have never had the Thai dessert it is modeled after but I have had my share of Asian desserts (half Filipino, raised in San Diego) and this definitely satisfies that craving. If you have ever had an Asian sweet rice dessert (like the Filipino dessert biko) you MUST get your hands on this juice. The hints of condensed milk, sticky rice and very subtle mango are a perfect combination. It's able to satisfy the sweet tooth without the flavor being so strong you can't use it as an ADV.   Here's the M. Night Shyamalan part of the whole thing: I don't really like lemons and I HATE mangos...go figure. This juice company though is doing it right if I'm digging flavors I usually can't stand.   Ordering next from them: Churros y Chocolate and Root Beer Float.   Their site: www.thevapekitchen.com
From the comments:   "A misfire is when you pull the trigger and your gun doesn't go "bang". When you don't want your gun to go bang, but you are too stupid to keep your booger-hook off the trigger and it goes "bang", it's called a negligent discharge.   In the Army and Marine Corps, a negligent discharge with get you disciplinary action that can include reduction in rank or worse. On a SWAT it gets you a nice cover-up."
Don't forget to take this matter under consideration from the basic fundamentals down to the granular details of what kind of mutual funds etc etc.   Fundamental 1: Liquid investments can disappear, market conditions etc etc. A house can't disappear, and if it does, all the better - just like selling it - you get a check   Fundamental 2: In the history of our country and our financial system, real estate (no not fucking bullshit mortgage investment funds) but real tangible real estate - usually outperforms the market if only by a slim margin.   Fundamental 3: Your career, your current cash savings, your current life situation is likely to change. Hopefully not drastically or unpleasantly, but outright owning a home when your career takes a shit on you, your wife takes a shit on you, or the economy takes a shit on you - is fundamentally sound.
I have Rosetta Stone Jap and have used it through level 2.  As with most other people in this subreddit, I agree that it is not the best resource, however it has been very helpful with me learning basic Kanji (basic Kanji meanings, not simple stroke Kanji) and reinforcing my Hiragana.   I memorized all the Hiragana beforehand in a week, and so when I went into Rosetta Stone and turned on the Kanji setting, it was really easy for me to tell what was/wasn't Kanji and where words began and ended.  Since Rosetta Stone starts with simple concepts, and because Kanji basically breaks up the vocab for you with simple sentences, you can learn a lot of those basic meanings real easy.  If you aren't scared of memorizing 10-20 stroke Kanji, I say it's a good investment when combined with other material.   Also, let me note that because Rosetta Stone forces you to speak back to it to test your speech, it can be helpful in forming your pronunciation.  I have heard Japanese all my life through the hobbies I like to do, so this wasn't really a big deal for me when I first started learning.  My younger brother's pronunciation however was pretty bad until he was forced to improve it because Rosetta Stone kept marking him wrong on those exercises.   Edit:
JBJ is a potential gold glove CF. Not the best speed, but his instincts, arm and first step are all great. Sizemore is a shell with good speed but no arm and rusty instincts. At this point, he's a good LF but not really a CF anymore. Vic is slightly better than Sizemore in CF, but still older and slower with a better arm, so he makes a good defensive RF (stronger arm than Grady).
Ok, I can't exactly tell you how pro tools is superior because in my opinion every DAW does pretty much the same thing. However, some are better at doing some things than others.   I will tell you where I think pro tools succeeds and where it fails. Please keep in mind that these are mostly my opinions and feel free to come to your own conclusions.   PT is fantastic at audio editing. There are many DAWS that imitate its edit modes but I feel pro tools got it perfect. It has every tool you need to arrange your audio and then some, but the most important part is how efficient it feels.   The downsides to pro tools are more on the routing side. Almost everything in this stage requires more steps to set up than any other DAW. So if speed is a requirement, throw out your mouse and make sweet love to the hotkey manual as it's the only way to get your sessions going as quickly as possible.   Let me just list a couple of my issues with it:     1. Click track is not available by default. You must create one and then route it.   2. Busses must be created as needed. If I want an aux track to receive from my aux sends I'm going to have to go menu diving to add it.    3. Certain aspects of the transport can be confusing to beginners and sometimes hidden from view by default.   4. Tempo follows either the master tempo or the conductor track. Not much of an issue if you know about it but its counterintuitive if you've used almost any other DAW. You'll notice that there are many things pro tools does its own way that really just complicate things for the end user.    5. And many other annoyances. I'm sure if I started using pro tools again I'd have a book to write about its inconveniences.
I made this throw-away to get peoples opinions on my situation.   Background:   When my gf and I first met I was a big pot smoker, she was and still is completely straight edge. She did not like it so I never smoked around her.  No issues there but then she wanted me to stop completely. I still wanted to do it with my friends, when lounging around playing video games, etc. This was the only real argument we would ever have. It finally ended when we basically agreed that I wouldn't tell her about it and she wouldn't ask. This was fine since I never did it around her anyway. Then we moved in together and I pretty much stopped smoking all together. One weekend she went away and I decided to get some to "re-live" my early days. Since then a few time a year a will buy some and secretly smoke it. She will be watching tv or out shopping and I will go smoke a bowl and use my computer for a while, things like that. This will go on until I run out of pot, then I will stay dry for a few months, get more, repeat.   My whole opinion on it is, I enjoy it, I never do it when I am around her anyway, what difference does it make? But I know she won't see it this way at all. She thinks all drugs are disgusting (alcohol, pot, tobacco, etc).  The legal aspect doesn't even cross her mind it is all due to health reasons ( I had a hard enough time convincing her that I like a beer every now and again after work).  I am frustrated that I ever let it get to this point. I took the easy way out back then (don't ask, don't tell) and now it has come back to bite me in the ass.   What should I do? Has anyone else been in this kind of situation?
I made it through undergrad with a degree in physics and math with totally average grades. ~3.0-3.3 out of 4.0 so a B average give or take.   I am now working on a PHD in physics and I think what helped me the most was the research and internships I did during undergrad.   Perhaps its different seeing as I do experimental physics, but once you prove that you can do good research your course work starts to matter less and less.   Once i have finished my PHD and presumably will be working in a lab somewhere be it a national lab or in industry what matters is me doing my job, not whether or not I got an A in undergrad solid state physics or graduate Math Methods.   Poor grades may hinder you from getting accepted to internships / REUs (research experience for undergraduates) at first but keep trying! Once you get some work under your belt and have something relevant to add to your resume/CV besides your grades then the grades will start to matter less.
I believe caring for the poor is a personal responsibility for people who seek Christ like me.   I do not believe that taking money by force is appropriate to pay for anything other than what the original earners of the money agree to in the US, since it is a representative republic.   I believe that forcibly taxing to support the financial low end encourages an impersonal sense of entitlement in the recipients of funds, and negligence, resentment and a lack of personal, emotional connection on the part of the original earners of the money.   Not to mention the wildly inefficient way the US government handles money in nearly any situation.   As a side note, I also believe that churches should be taxed. If they make money and run it like a business, they should be taxed like one. If they want to set up one or several charity groups to directly funnel money to those in need, that is a separate issue.
Hello /r/trees, need some advice up in here. I have been on the lookout for a job for the past few weeks, but alas, most required a urine test. Anticipating this, I stopped smoking on the 14th of May (prior to this I smoked multiple times daily), with the intent of going 30 days or so, to give me a clean sample.   I know there are various flushers/cleansers out there, but I don't want to pay $50 for them, nor did I want to bother trying to sneak in a friend's clean piss to the test (what with trying to maintain the correct temp, and getting it in unnoticed), so I figured a straight-up break was the best way to go. I have been drinking lots of water, exercising daily, and have only slightly been exposed to second-hand smoke (my GF is a smoker, I hang in the same room ocassionally). I am a big guy (6'5, 210), as I am under the impression that this might affect me.   Now here's my situation: recently, a job has come up that looks very good to me (10.50/hr, full time position, other various benefits and perks), and the application states that a drug-test is part of the application process. At this point, it has been a solid three weeks, and I am wondering if at this point, I would be able to pass? I don't want to wait too long, lest the position is filled... Anyone been in a similar situation and come out OK?   At this point, I am thinking of getting my application in at the end of the week and hoping they schedule my test for next Monday, at which point it will have been four weeks.
Story so long had to break it up, Part two here   All this happened about 3 months into Kris's lease. But he didn't want to stay there anymore, so he moved out. We got word out he didn't live there anymore hoping that would keep them from finding our place an attractive score again. However, just in case, we decided to stock up on firearms.   We had another friend, I will call Jason, move in with us in Kris's spot. Jason had some could gun connections, Mike bought a 12ga pump shotgun, I bought a small .32 auto pistol. Bad thing about my .32, it had no safety, at all. I thought no problem, I just won't keep the clip in it.   We regularly threw parties still after Kris moved out. Also, we still kept a small amount of weed in the house, mostly for personal use, but also just in case some of the girls who came over needed a small sack or something.   We had a party one Friday night, and I had left for a few hours to go bang some chick. Mike stayed back with Jason, Mike's friend Josh, and a few girls. Josh was the kind of guy who was always playing with our guns.   I kept my .32 under my pillow, with two fully loaded clips next to it, and my personal sack of bud. One night I went to sleep, somehow grabbed the gun from under the pillow while I slept, and pulled the trigger in my sleep. PAP! The fucking thing went off and shot my in left leg, entry would was right next to my balls. The angle of the gun meant the bullet, a .32 hollowpoint, did not exit, it traveled from the top of my left leg through the muscle to about 2 inched above my kneecap. It felt like someone had hit me in the leg with a sledgehammer, and kept hitting me with it.   Jason was actually sleeping on the floor beside my bed and jumped up right away yelling 'What the fuck was that??', I responded 'I think I just shot myself'. If I'd have lifted that gun up at all in my sleep before I shot, I could have shot him on the floor. He was thoroughly freaking out. He didn't believe it was a gunshot, because the barrel was pressed next to my leg, he said it sounded like someone stepped on a light bulb. For some fucked up reason, i decided I didn't want to bleed all over the carpet so i crawled into the bathroom and got in the bathtub. Jason went to get Mike and tell him what happened. They were shitting, because we had drugs, scales, and paraphernalia all over the house. Which they had to get rid of BEFORE they could call for help for me. Mike was rounding all the shit up and luckily Kris, who i let borrow my car that night, came knocking on the door. Jason opened the door and told him '(My name here) had just shot himself!!' and threw the duffel bag full of shit in his hands. Kris was shocked, like 'What the fuck??' Kris came to look at me in the tub, and was like 'Dude, i thought you'd be dead, they made it sound like you was dead'. I replied 'Just take that shit and get out so we can call the cops'. Which he did.   First on the scene was the Fire department. They came and pulled me into the living room, and made me sit right in front of the door till the cops got there. Said the cops had to clear the scene, even though they had already been all the way to the back of the apartment in the bathroom. Cops got there and didn't believe i shot myself. Thought I was covering for one of the other guys in the house. Then the asked where the gun was, I told them in my bed, Jason showed them. He came out with it in a bag and asked where the clip was, I told them under my pillow. I completely forgot about the weed i had there too. The cop brought out the clips, unloaded them, one was short one round from full.   Mike later told me he thought when Josh went to the bathroom he took too long, and he probably was playing with my gun. Josh later admitted to that. The doctor's told me I missed my femoral artery by less than one inch, and if I'd have hit that, I'd have died before I knew what happened. To this day I still have to bullet lodged in my left leg. The doctor's told me it was buried too deep in the muscle to dig out and that over time the muscle would push it closer to the edge, then they would remove it.
Not sure why I got this bug, but it was pretty consistent and reproducible, so I thought I'd share. This is for the PC version.   Near the end of the game when you fight Craig and his Nazi zombie cows,  do not use Cartman  as your buddy.  The game would stutter about a minute into the battle, then hard-freeze the entire computer. Couldn't alt-tab out of the game, or even get a response from ctrl+alt+del.  Only thing I could really do was do a hard cutoff on my PC.  Once the computer was back up, I'd restart, try again, and it's stutter and freeze again.   Seeing as how I'm on a fresh install of Win8.1 x64 with up to date video drivers(running a GTX 770), I thought this was weird.  Out of curiosity, I tried changing my buddy to Stan.  The fight never froze, never stuttered, and played perfectly.   So I quit the game, and tried the Craig battle again with Kyle.  Still no freezing, no stuttering.   I quit the game again and tried with Butters.  No stuttering, no freezing.   I quit the game and tried again with Cartman.  It  did  stutter and hard freeze my PC.
Hey guys!   First of all I'd like to say that this subreddit is a great community and (almost) everyone in it.   But I just recently got disabled from entering the game because every time i try to join a server it just shows the loading screen and nothing else. I can sit through the entire loading screen and when I hope to get in when the black screen comes on with the white little ticking stuff, an another map's loading screen comes in and i cannot do anything. The game worked fine just today and now i can't go past the loading screen. Things I've tried so far:     Re-entered the game (closed it and joined again).     Re-entered browser. (Chrome, if that helps)     Relogged on Battlelog.     Restarted computer.       Otherwise I'll give a brief overview of my specs, maybe it is helpful:   Processor: AMD (cant remember what type) Quad Core 2,8 GHz   Memory: 2x2 GB DDR3 1333Mhz   GPU: AMD Radeon HD 7770 1GB DDR5   HDD: Western Digital Caviar Green 2TB   OS: Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit)   Thanks for reading this and helping me out!
The other day I sat in Psiyo's stream and literally mashed my keys away in his chat discussing about a ton of present and past drama's in LoL's LCS and it made me think about something, why is it our rival moba's and heck actual sports fans desperate for rivals/BM towards each other but our community will call someone out for not being nice to each other?   Imagine if SMITE had it's Arsenal vs Tottenham/Barcelona vs Real Madrid games where fans really got behind the teams because they knew there was a huge rivalry there... instead of someone vocalizing there disagreement is proclaimed to Satan on the SMITE reddit and slapped on the wrist?
As rational as I like to think I am, from what I remember of the trip, it felt like I saw every possible situation I could have been  in while taking the salvia hit. They were all laid out like a storyboard, thousands of them. Same room, same people, same drug, different outcomes. My vision would zoom into one of these boards and I would live that for a few minutes, zoom back out to see them all again and zoom straight back into another. In the end I guess I just zoomed into the storyboard that was actually the situation I was really living. I "woke up" flat on my back on the bed salivating. So yeah, sorry if that sounds like bullshit, but I don't imagine people make much sense when explaining trips haha.
Hello everyone! My name is Josef and I stream at  I am currently working on a fundraiser for New Hope For Kids and am trying to get a tad bit of help here. New Hope for Kids is a Non-Profit organization based in the Central Florida area that has one of its programs set up to help accomplish and fulfill these wishes for young kids facing a shorter life span than the average person would.  My group and I are currently working on a few different fundraising activities in the UCF Orlando area to raise money for a young girl named Solmarie. She is living with Cerebral Palsy, Deafness, Epilepsy, and slight Mental Retardation. We are raising money for one main reason; Solmarie wants to go on a Disney Cruise with her family very badly.   Now that you have some background, the main reason I am posting here is because one of are events is going to be me streaming video games. I plan on doing this at least once a week for at least 4 hours for the next few weeks (this will usually be on Wednesdays at night, from roughly 4 or 6 pm (EST) till as late as I can, sometimes much earlier, sometimes much later). I am not fantastic at any games I will be playing, but I consider myself fairly amusing and fun to watch. I don’t rage or flame often if at all so none of that, but I always try and joke around and will try and interact with the viewers as much as possible. I will mostly be playing Path of Exile, League of Legends, and Diablo; but I have a giant steam library I built up over the past year and a half from amazing deals I found and have not found the time to play the majority of those yet. So at any time if my viewer base wants to watch me play any games on that list, Be it getting killed insanely fast in FTL and probably getting pissed off at my horrible luck, Trying out Dark souls for more than the 10 minutes I have logged (and probably getting destroyed over and over), playing some Borderlands 2, skyrim, or any of the other games I have there (most are small indie titles), I will gladly do so.   Throughout the streaming events (and even when I am not currently streaming) I will have a link directly to the New Hope for Kids website and their donations page, and a link to a PayPal account that I will use to collect donations, 100% of which is going to her wish. Our goal is $1500, I know that is far from what I will raise here and am honestly just hoping to raise as much as possible of it through my gaming to help lower what we need to raise from other projects (partial proceed events, bake sales, etc.). I can personally promise that New Hope for Kids is a great organization, and they will not abuse any donations and all the money will go towards the child, but please feel free to do research on your own before donating anything. And don’t forget, that every dollar matters and every penny counts. Even if you cannot donate much, sharing my stream and cause on Facebook, etc or giving a buck or two is greatly appreciated. It can add up fast, especially over a few weeks. To donate go to ( and please put "for Solmarie's Wish" in the "I want my donation to be for" box. This link will be on my stream as well.   Now since I am not that great at any of the games I am playing, I needed something to attract people to the stream. So after finding out about this fundraising opportunity and wanting to have a way to make this stream idea successful I gained some extra copies of keys for steam games to give away. I have a few indie games (spacechem, scoregasm, magicka, binding of issac, ect. nothing to fancy) to give away and quite a few other keys as well. I haven’t fully decided how I will give each prize away or when which prizes will be given yet but more info on that will be updated on the stream when I come up with it.
So I'm a PC player running a pretty decent pc .. 8 core cpu, 16gb 1600mhz ram, ssd and Gigabyte GTX 970 4GB OC.   I'm struggling to hold 60fps sometimes in 2v2s and I've tried everything, reinstalled the gfx card, changed drivers went through nearly every version of drivers released for my card and no different. I have changed game settings, turned off blood MFAA, Ant Aliasing, all that stuff but no change if fact changing the video setting from potato retro low mode to high quality seems to have minimal affect on the fps its more the fact that I'm stuck around 15-60ish...   I thought it was bottlenecking from my cpu but I have checked my cpu and there is absolutely no usage issues there I just don't understand.   Is anyone else having this issue or know of a fix. Any and all help is welcome.   Thanks in advance!
As a Canadian, i know of this trick and so do quite a few foreign vendors and they are quite familiar with it. Most Canadians that i know do not flaunt the fact they are Canadian, we just are, we don't need to advertise it to the world. I only know of Americans that do this, it is kinda sad when the whole world hates you and you have to hide who you are, just wear your own colors proudly. The only time Canadians do this is usually not intentional, sometimes we like to wear roots and Olympic support shirts from zellers that happen to have Canada written on them.   I first learned of this trick 6 years ago when i used to work in a tourist trap area in Canada and the American tourist would inform us this was common practice. It is however EXTREMELY plain to see when you get an american tourist or a Canadian one.   After having worked in the tourist area, i have a few question for American tourists: Why do yo feel so entitled? why does retail and services have to please your every need? why do you think anyone working a low level retail or service position is automatically your slave?   I know not all Americans do this and i apologize for offending people if i have but try to enjoy and assimilate when you are traveling, do not be rude to shop keepers or people working in the service industry. Just try to have a good time and be nice, perhaps change the views others have of your country by being the change.
Calm the fuck down.     Groundzer0 posted such a good reply that many of us probably thought he/she covered the bases already. Look at the time stamps.     Mentioning something about yourself implies asking for special treatment and is totally fucking irrelevant. "Mexican/Black/Teacher/CEO/Single Mom/Female/Pope/whatever" doesn't matter.     You have the White Knight trope  completely ass-backwards.  Advertising that you are a tech-clueless girl means you are trying to take advantage of White Knights. What you just saw is actually the opposite. In fact, you're acting like a White Knight right now.     I like my screwdrivers.
In my high school there was a kid named Joe. He had always been kinda off, but during one summer his father was killed in a construction accident while working on a new building for our high school. After that he seemed to have snapped. He started wearing really tight girl's clothes that were very....unflattering for him. He also renamed himself Claire Sharp, the first and last name of two popular girls and refused to answer to Joe. I tried to be friendly toward him, but one day I made the mistake of calling him Joe and he hissed at me and then punched my arm pretty hard so I gave up the sympathy pretty quickly. One day right before my graduation during lunch break he just got up and stood on top of the table....I panicked and thought Oh my god he's finally going to kill all of us. Then he started singing Never Gonna Give You Up.
I'll try not to have a wall of text. The following is pretty trivial and average but it'll make me feel a bit better by venting.   Last night I went out with my girlfriend and two of her guy friends. We all get along really well. Before I met up with everyone, for some reason I decided that smashing down a 6 pack in the hour before I leave would be a good idea.   When I left my place and met up with everyone, I was already pretty drunk. We went out for dinner and I was just being in a pretty silly drunk mood. At this point there were no issues.   My mistake was that I kept drinking and knocking them back. It was then when my girlfriend mentioned that we were going to go to a place where her and another buddy of hers used to go. This buddy of hers has some history with her. Nothing sexual but he has confessed his love for her numerous times, and every time has been rejected. I've never had an issue with him (haven't met him) but for some reason I got all pissy and upset. This pissed her off.   Once we got to the place, I was told that I probably shouldn't drink anymore but I did anyway. I ended up pulling her away from her friends and went on about how it is shit that I haven't met this dude yet. Turns out they aren't speaking and she is really hurt by it (he is pretty much her best friend) (I'm kinda the reason why he won't talk to her too).   After that we went back over to her friends and I was just talking stupid drunk shit with them but it got to the point where we all needed to leave because I was too drunk and wouldn't go home.   On the walk home (just me and her now) I tried getting her to talk to me about our little blue but she wouldn't even let me touch her. She ended up getting so angry at me, the first time I've seen her get like that towards me, but then she quickly snapped out of it and walked off. I continued to try and talk to her about things but she refused to communicate. We walked in silence for a bit before I spazzed out and started punching walls and shit (my hand is all fucked up now).   We got home and I ended up crying, rolling around on the ground like an idiot for a good while. Like, fucking wailing. She just stood there watching me telling me to go to bed. Then for some fucking reason I told her that I watched porn for the first time in 6 months the other night (like, Wtf?). Then passed out.   This morning she didn't want to talk to me at all, didn't want me to touch her and literally couldn't even look at me.   I ended up texting her after she left saying how sorry I was for my behaviour and that I feel worst about how I've made her feel, and that I was sorry for trying to pressure her into talking to me, and that I want to talk when's she is ready.   Still no reply and that's where I'm at at the moment. I feel terrible because it's our first fight but I've never had a situation like this where my girlfriend won't even say a word to me.   This just needs time right? I've pissed her off big time and she just needs to cool down and then she will talk to me about things.. right? Haha. It's just I'm a believer of getting shit sorted and fixing the problem without it needing to hang around for longer than it needs to. Like, I feel fucking shit that she left my house like this.
Hey, just sigh, ok, I dunno, should probably just quit the game or commit suicide, sigh.   I finally got to my D4 promotions today after winning 8 matches in a row gaining 12-14 lp a win and losing around 30 lp a loss.   I lost my first match, my botlane fed hard, not saying it's what lost the game, but made it insanely difficult.  The second match started out rough, botlane flashing under turret just to die and supports going 1v2, their Lucian along with their Yi jungle was insanely fed. But we managed to push through and kill their vlad all the time who didnt seem to care (average d50 lp player) and in the end won the game due to vlad making it a 5v4. Now to the 3rd match, good communication in the lobby and the match started well, except botlane flashed under turret lvl 3 and died, when we had clearly come to terms in the lobby to play it safe due to our superior lategame comp. That started the Twitch snowballing, and it didnt help that our toplaner stood on their innerturret and died again and again. The duo botlane proceeded to get caught before a drake, baron or basically any time they could. So in the end we lost the game and now im sitting at 65 lp, I lost promos and am now sitting on a lousy 65 lp with the horrendous LP gain/loss in d5 due to Master tier.   Riot please just fix your shit, you got tons of money. FUCK THE FUCKING SHITTY ASS CHROMA SKINS, THEY CAN GO BURN.   FIX D5 FIX YOUR SHITTY ASS CLIENT FIX YOUR PRIORITIES AND MAKE THE RANKED LADDER REWARDING AGAIN   Now Im sitting here writing a vent/rant post after cleaning up after I smashed a glass into my microwave and destroyed it more than you destroyed D5, and that's saying a lot.
My friend, you fail to see the errors of this article and you bash me defending an attempt that is made up so as to lead in very narrow conclusions.   The error lies in the fact that this article fails to portrait the "average" Greek guy and his problems nowadays. It's all about the fringe.   If you show this article to anyone living in Greece they all gonna have one response.   "Wait, this guy has no friends or family to take care of him?"   It's about the 0,1% of the population while as you note the vast majority of young people suffer in a very boring and uneventful way.
So you're saying we shouldn't oppose fascist arseholes because a few people take it too far? Get fucked. The police can say what they like, the fact is (I saw it with my own two eyes) that there was violent disorder from small groups of either sides, many intimidation attempts on the part of the MFE, but the majority was a boatload of racists marching in our city, and a boatload of residents turning up to tell them to go fuck themselves.   This is not a "both sides as bad as each other" situation. This is good people standing up against a force of evil.   It's lovely that a bunch of self-righteous cunts are sitting at home speculating based on filtered information, but they can go fuck themselves.   > If they'd just turned up, been herded around by the police for an hour or two and then sent home we could have avoided a lot of that.   Nope, because while that's  lovely  to believe, what actually happens when these thugs turn up unopposed, is that they run around smashing up ethnic owned businesses and Mosques, and intimidating people, whilst gaining support from other thugs next year due to a "victory in the commie capital" or something. You  have  to show massive opposition to fascism or it festers and grows. The reason the EDL are such a shambles now is because when they suffer continuous defeat like this, their internal firm rivalries rear their head and they start fighting each other.
Over the last two years that we have been dating, I have probably lost $50,000 gambling in various places, and online. I have a very well paying job, so she will never see it, but it still makes me think: What could I be doing for her with this money?   The bottom line is: I love gambling. I love the thrill of the chase, and I love doing it with my friends. I know this is all a problem and I am currently seeking help for it.   The question is: Should I tell my fiance? I feel so bad already, and I don't want to disappoint her with news that basically means we could have bought our house with cash a year earlier. I haven't gambled in over 3 months, but it still eats me inside that I've never told her about it.e
Edited because post title is confusing.  Wedding isn't 'casual' (the suggested attire is 'beach elegant' and explained below). However, her chosen gown is wayyyy more formal than our wedding and more formal than my bridal gown!!   Hey Weddit!   My fiancé and I have a beach wedding coming up in November. We have a wedding website where the suggested attire states 'beach elegant' followed by "Suggestions: For the ladies, a long or short summery cocktail dress, a dressy skirt & top, or nice pants with a blouse would be perfect. For the men, a summer or linen suit would fit right in, as would nice slacks with a collared shirt. We don’t want to sway your swag, but please stay away from shorts, casual t-shirts/crop-tops, swimwear, etc, please. :)"   My fiancé's sister in law (the grooms brothers fiancé) has stated that she is looking for a dress to wear to the wedding, and at one point said her budget is 'up to $1000'. She has said she wants her dress to be 'formal, bright, and sparkly because her soul is made of glitter'. She has sent me pictures of dresses that she is interested in trying on and the ones she likes are literally PROM dresses and seriously blinged out. (Think hot pink prom gown covered in crystals).   I don't want to be a controlling Bridezilla, but she is going to be part of the processional and also in family pictures, and to be honest, I don't want her wearing something that is more formal that my own wedding dress. I have tried casually saying things to her like 'it really isn't a very formal wedding, casual is just fine' and 'you're crazy haha. My dress isn't even that fancy or sparkly'. She just doesn't seem to get it and said 'I'm sure your dress is pretty. I just don't really do casual for weddings anymore, especially family weddings'   We recently got in a small non wedding related argument (I said something that wasn't directed at her or about her and she took it very personally) so I feel like I am walking on thin ice with her right now. Is there anything I can say to her about wearing this type of outfit to my wedding without pissing her off further, causing family drama, and without coming across as a complete bitch? Or is asking her to wear something more casual overstepping things?   Thanks in advance!
The realization that I have to become this caricature of myself in order to be attractive to women disgusts me, both toward myself and toward them.   Yep.  I'm an occasional contributor over at /r/TheRedPill, but that's my biggest problem with it (which I keep to myself because reddit circle jerk culture).  How is it alpha to spend all your time working your ass off perfecting your abs ("Do you think she will notice my abs?") or shopping for clothes ("Will she like how this shirt looks on me?") or even how you stand or speak ("Will she will think this tone of voice is sexy?")?   I really want to own my own life more than that.  Hey, I get it.  A lot of Red Pill guys are very young, and women at their absolute peak attractiveness are within their datable age range.  This is a window of opportunity for them.   At this point for me though, the amount of shit you have to go through to have a  non-obese , and she absolutely gives zero fucks about you, probably doesn't even remember your name by next week.. still not sexy, sorry.   Then of course The Wall^© happens and they get the baby rabies and make the 'huge sacrifice' of moving down the SMV scale to one of us average guys with a good job, so they can have the mcmansion, SUV, and all that shit.  WTF?  Those poor guys, stuck paying thousands a month in alimony and child support just a few years later.  Or put up with decades of an entitled fat lady living in your house, running the place, and refusing you boring starfish sex because you didn't clean the dead rats out of the basement like she told you.
Thats because buffy spent 7 seasons handling more and more loss, pain and responsibility, becoming more and more isolated and pressured with each season. Faith spent 3 seasons dealing with her issues and her issues alone, and showed up just in time to look like the best leader to a bunch of whiny spoiled bitches who wouldnt listen to buffy, just before the series ended.
People, don't do this. At least, unless you can fight.   Last year, I was walking home from the gym, which I hadn't been able to use because the new guy manning the front desk didn't understand a policy, clarified when I called his boss later, and wouldn't let me use the equipment; he'd followed that up by calling me "college boy" and refusing to give me his name.   Walking out, there was a group of guys using the basketball court, and another guy standing to the side, watching. When that last guy saw me, he came up and quite literally got in my face. He was asking who I was, where I lived, and whenever I tried to sidestep him to leave, he'd mirror my movements. After a minute of this, I finally managed to walk past him, though he started calling after me. As I was about to cross a street into a nearby park, I felt something woosh past my head, and a small branch landed a few feet in front of me. I lost it.   I picked up the branch, chased him into the basketball court, and hit him with it, then stormed out. The other guys were laughing at him, so he followed me across the street and into the park (which, as it turned out, was just beyond the range of the building's security camera).   At this point is where I should have run (but I didn't, because I was still a bit high on the fact that I'd stood up to this asshole). However, as it turns out, the guys on the court? His friends. You can guess what happened next.   The doctor said if they'd hit me a few more times, they'd have had to operate on my right eye.
I've been a casual poster here for a while. Made a new account just cause the gf knows my original Reddit account... Maybe this should go in AskSeddit? Didn't think it fit the mold of those questions though.   Anyway, enough of the banter. Backstory: I knew this girl (HB:8.5 in looks, but incredibly smart and great personality) about a year ago when I was straight up AFC. I saw her casually for a bit, but she was still fucking her ex and I was making no headway whatsoever. So I cut my losses and went back to forever alone. Then I found PUA and it opened my eyes. I became a different person. Reconnected with this same chick about 9 months ago. 8 months ago she was calling me her boyfriend. It's been great for the most part since then.   Key words: Most part. In the past three months or so I've hit a huge bad patch. Got dragged into the mucky waters of alcoholism. The booze and I have always had a tumultuous relationship, but recently it had got the best of me. I racked up tons of debt (being in school and working part time was fine until alcohol becomes your primary expense). And had to delay entering med school by a year. It only takes a few months to turn your life into shit, trust me.   I've only started to get my life back on track (going to AA, focusing on managing my money, getting my med school shit back together). I'm somewhat worried about my girlfriend. I'm not going to lose her, she loves me too much and has invested so much in me I can confidently say she won't leave me. I gamed her well the second time around.   But I can feel attraction slowly waning. She lives far out from me. If she wants to see me, she has to spot me gas money, I bum cigarettes off of her (trying to quit, incredibly unnecessary expense, but try quitting smoking and drinking at the same time... worst feeling in the world), don't take her out anymore, simply because I can't afford it right now. Trying piece my life back together.   She's starting Law School this year and I was supposed to enter Med and everything was going to be perfect. But things never work out the way you want them to. I will get in the following year (she switched to a lower-tier law school just so she could stay in the city and be with me... talk about investment...).   This is temporary in the large scheme of things. I need a few months to piece things back to the way they were.   Here's my question to the Seddit community: Is there anyway I can build or even maintain attraction during this difficult period or do I just hold on for dear life and hope this relationship works while I piece my shit together.   Sex is still good though, that's a plus.
I definitely think you're right about the latter part in terms of being guarded by a 4, but when you really look at his game, it's ultimately his strength that allows him to do a lot of the things that he does.  He blows by the bigger guys that he can pull away from the basket, but he uses angles and his body to get by people that are more athletic than he is, which he'd still be able to do towards the end of his career (assume we don't start churning out more LeBron-like players).   And all of that is just to facilitate and hit the open shooters like you mentioned because he makes everyone else around him more dangerous with open shots, but can also finish if necessary once he beats his man.  The only thing LeBron has to do over any offseason besides getting his body in shape for another long season is working on his jumper as that's really the only thing I'd say that separates he and Jordan — Jordan from 10+ feet out was just as dangerous as LeBron at the bucket.  LeBron shoots ~40% from 10+ feet when he started going jumper-heavy in his shot selection (his average shot distance went up from 12 to 13 feet from '08 to '09), but while the numbers aren't physically available for Jordan (shooting stats to that degree weren't recording until 2000), it's pretty much widely accepted that Jordan's jumper was deadly from mid-range when open.  LeBron is getting there, but still has a little ways to go although it is worth noting that LeBron is better from three than Jordan was but Jordan rarely shot them as much.
I can't give advice on all of the aspects you describe, but i have always had the attitude that it is not OK to go on any entertainment sites when at work or at school. At most you can take a quick peek at reddit on your phone when at the bathroom, or a quick peek at a mainstream news site on your work computer during a break or lunch. If you need a breather or you are underutilized outside of these parameters, go get some water or just ponder the work at hand. Worst case if you quite don't know how to spend your time, look at some company standards or some other kind of informational material that will make you more valuable in the long run to spend your time.   If you stick to this way of thinking you will be mostly productive at least 2/3 of the day.
Clearly she hasn't been to some of the more wonderful bridges. I recommend biking along the Great Allegheny Passage, there are some drop dead gorgeous stone, concrete, wooden, iron, and steel bridges that are incorporated into the rail-trail system. [I think one of my favorites was in Ohiopyle.]( The view was [beyond amazing]( and the bridge was what made it entirely possible. The whole area itself is renowned for its natural beauty, and it's right next to falling water.   I think my favorite part though was that there wasn't a single fatty in the entire town. Not one. Everyone there works out and enjoys the outdoors, in part because it's very safe to ride bikes out there to work or to school/class, even to the next town because of the trail. As my state has been investing in better infrastructure, we're actually seeing a meaningful decrease to our obesity rate- I think for the first time in decades, it has gone  down .   This trail goes from Pittsburgh to D.C., (in conjunction with another trail), and it has revitalized tourism along the entire trail. It is some stunningly beautiful country, and it could not be done without the bridges over these awesome rivers.
They have a way higher than 15% civilian casualty rate.   Literally, if you are a male between the age of 15 and 55 in a combat zone (designated as the entire planet, wherever the drone lands), you are a "combatant."   Many times, the Pentagon will launch a drone strike even if they have no evidence of wrong-doing. They'll wipe out 30 people if it means getting a shot at one "bad guy."   I'm not making any point other than that it is absurdly naive to think that drone strikes aren't essentially targeting civilians. They make zero effort to avoid them.   On top of that, understanding that civilians who are perceived as colluding with the enemy are also targets is crucial here. Hence why Bin Laden's cab driver was picked up and tortured in Gitmo.
High school teacher here. In all my years, the worst student I have ever had was this asshole kid who just hated school and authority. According to most of my students I'm pretty chill, I play a lot of video games and keep up on new music so I have a lot in common with them and I treat them like human beings and actually listen to them when they talk to me, which I found to be the one thing that adolescents respect most about adults. So anyway, I had this kid who I couldn't fucking deal with, he was just a total dick and all the other kids didn't like him either. The week before winter break I told the kids (9th graders) that if they were good, we would have a Holiday Party and I would bring in my PS3 and we could play Rock Band on the overhead projector. Also, they could bring in cupcakes, soda and snacks. This kid was being a douche and I warned him twice that if he didn't behave he would have to go sit in the office during our party. He didn't care and fucked around anyway. So the day came and I sent him to the office to serve his detention. When he went up there and told the principle that I slapped him in the face, and called him a bunch of racial slurs. They sent me home for the day on "administrative leave" and and they pulled all the kids out of the class and interviewed them to find out if I actually assaulted the kid and/or called him a "stupid little nigger". It was a day of hell for me having to go through that but in the end they realized that the kid made it up to get revenge on me for not letting him hang out at the party and they expelled the kid from the school. Also, I heard his dad punished the shit out of him for it, because they had to call him in from his job and they called the cops because when the father still thought that his kid was telling the truth, he threatened to find me and kill me.
Here's what "abstract reasoning" is:  The ability to analyze information and solve problems on a complex level.   Here's an example of abstract reasoning:  What is the next symbol in [this sequence](   Here's why it's irrelevant to the subject of consent:  While abstract reasoning skills do emerge fairly early in childhood, executive functions like planning, working memory, and impulse control are among the last to develop in the brain.   Executive functions  are what allow an individual to assess a situation and pause to plan a course of action before carrying out an activity.  Although even young children can be taught some degree of impulse control, the ability to [consistently and independently do so requires neurological maturation](
Hey everyone,   So it's been just over a year that I split up with my ex-gf of almost 8 years. We lived together for 5 of those and for the most part had a great relationship. The last couple years declined and we eventually mutually split up. It just wasn't working and we started to go down different paths in life.   So, it took me a long while, but I'm finally getting over the relationship, working on myself and starting to think about dating again. I know for a fact she went out and slept with someone 3 months after we initially split, which was upsetting, but fine.   In this past year we have kept in contact sporadically, she lives in another part of the country now, so we may text back and forth every 4 or 5 months, just a "Hey, how are you doing" etc...   We did meet once about 5 months back when she was in town visiting her friends.   Everything was good, and we always talked about remaining friends, in fact this was her idea in the first place, she wanted to make sure we didn't just "disappear" and stayed in touch.   In any case, we last speak in December 2014, she texts me asking how I am, etc... I mention we should skype or something soon cause we haven't actually talked in a long time and I missed our friendship. She said the same thing and that she would text me in a couple weeks when work wasn't busy to set something up.   Well, nothing from her from that point on. I figured since it's my birthday coming up she may text me then or something. I come to find out that she actually is in town this week through a friend (not intentionally, just came up in passing) and so that was a shock. I figured like last time she would text me to set up sometime to meet up before she leaves.   Not a day later do I then find out that she got on a plane and left back for home. I didn't hear from her once, didn't know she was coming, nothing.   Now, I obviously don't expect her to tell me her every coming and going, but it feels disappointing to me that we talked about remaining friends and the rare time she comes to visit she doesn't even make an effort to contact me.   It almost hurts worse than the breakup the fact that okay, the relationship didn't work out, but now, through her actions, she saying she doesn't even want to be friends.   I have no idea how I should feel about this. I'm trying to be rationale, but it honestly made me feel like utter shit.   Looking for some advice on this one.   Thanks.
Well this thread is 20 minutes old and already we have two sarcastic responses suggesting they are innocent and awkward because they think the joke never gets old.   Classic /r/teenagers.   OP you wanted a story, and I shall deliver.   Freshman year, me and my friends are bored at one of their houses for the night. Let's call him Jack. Jack's house is the shit and his parents aren't home. After doing the usual (raid liquor cabinet, play Playstation, mess around throughout the house) we start texting a group of girls who are also having a sleepover. There's five of us, six of them. Eventually we cajole them to slip out unnoticed (which I'm still not sure how they pulled off) and meet us at Jack's. We go up to his roof balcony and all get flirty. After a half hour our young minds spark an idea to go skinny dipping. The lake by Jacks is about a half mile away through various residential streets and one small trail. Me and Jack lead the group through sidewalks and suburbs just before reaching the lake where we strip down to our bare asses, everyone else follows (birthday) suit and we jump in the water.   Fast forward twenty minutes where I'm pretty sure we'd all have boners if it wasn't so damn cold. Then we hear yells in the nearby trees.   What the fuck.   Everybody freezes. One friend uses this opportunity to hold a girl close for "protection". Doesn't go over too well. But still the yells get louder, coming in every twenty seconds. Eventually we get the fuck out of the water and run to grab our clothes. As we're running naked across the shoreline flashlights beam from three or four different points in the trees surrounding.   We would be pissing our pants, if we had any. Then a flashlight turns on and runs towards us from the direction of our clothes. We stop and turn and run through the trees going back into the neighborhood. Our plan I guess is to streak through the neighborhood to get back to Jack's and get clothes there (we had left our valuables at Jack's beforehand, which turned out to be an extremely smart move). But, then two flashlights come towards us down the street. Two flashlights spaced perfectly apart.   Wait. No. Headlights.   A car zooms towards us and the driver laughs manically. So we look for somewhere to hide and evade all these incredibly creepy chasers. We find a backyard where nobody is home and hide (we're all still naked) on the patio. After fifteen minutes we hear chatter and a bunch of car doors opening and closing.   Now we're in the clear. We run back for our clothes, which were thrown in the lake (the guy's clothes, the girls's were dry as a bone). We awkwardly walk back to jacks naked with clothed females. When we get back to Jacks the girls go back home and we throw our clothes in the washing machine. We borrow Jack's clothes and talk about pros and cons of the night.   Months later we find out Jack's older brother in college was unknowingly in town with some friends. He hid in the backyard while we were on the balcony and eavesdropped on our plans then proceeded to terrorize us.
My brother in law came over for our daughters 3rd birthday party. He's a NY Firefighter and had been doing 24 hour shifts as cleanup duty for hurricane Sandy. About an hour after he arrived he cracked open my liqueur cabinet and started having his way, I felt like he earned it and he can crash in our basement so no big deal. Fast forward 5 hours and a expensive bottle of gentleman jack later and he's piss drunk. My wife and I work to get him into the basement, without a second bottle, that takes about 45 minutes because he's really determined to set a record for how drunk an Irish fireman can get.   Wake up in the morning and send my wife downstairs to wake him, after noticing that second bottle is now missing. She comes upstairs and says, "I think Mikey was crying last night, there's tissues all over the floor." I didn't have the heart to tell her.
Explain further what you mean, please? Are you saying that Obama/his administration are doing this for approval rates or votes? If that's the truth, then that makes me incredibly upset and want to fight even harder. Just because it seems impossible or like a waste of energy doesn't mean it's not worthwhile or important for me to at least TRY.   I'm a citizen of the US, and my fiancé application is sitting on a shelf and will be for possibly another 4 or 5 months at TSC (making the entire process take 10-11months instead of 6-7), while those who were lucky enough to be routed to CSC are having their interviews scheduled already (which means they are just a couple months away from having their Visa issued).  This may seem petty but when you realize who your soul mate is, how quickly life can change in an instant.. every month is excruciating.   I am with Obama's immigration reform. It's not just about DACA. It's the system as a whole we are trying to address and asking for a change.   I know this all seems like a long shot, but the more of us there are willing to speak up about it, the more chance we have.
Come to SJSU man! I'm in college here and every EDM concert is great. Always a fun crowd and a great environment. Plus they are extremely relaxed about the drug scene if that's what you want. They just make sure you are safe.   My friends went to Pop The Dream, which was at the same arena(Oracle) and they said it wasn't worth it at all. They got stuck in some high level seats and were forced to wait over an hour just to get on the dance floor.
Hello ladies!   I am very protective of my hair, using schmancy natural shampoos (I tried no-poo, didn't work for me), doing minimum styling, and ignoring haidressers when they suggest chemically straightening or colouring it, let alone bleaching it. It is medium thickness, a warm brown, and gently wavey/occaisionally kinky.   However, despite this caution of mine, I am jealous of all these girls walking around with crazy-coloured hair. Now, I don't really want hot pink, since that would involve bleaching it. But I've been looking into henna, for its all-natural, conditioning properties. I've always liked red and redddish hair. I have researched it, and it all seems good, when first applied. However, I'm cautious about the fact that it does not generally completely fade out, but that a first application of it will fade somewhat. What does that end up looking like? I'm also pretty sure that I don't want to keep on dyeing it to get a "bold, brassy red", so this might be a one time thing? And since it doesn't fade out, and I'm growing my hair, what will happen if I want to dye it different colours? Is there any other issues that I've missed?
I actually had the opposite of a NDE.   It was a Saturday afternoon. My friends and I (all seasoned trippers) were planning on taking different substances. Let's refer to my friends as k, j, and v. J and V were doing shrooms (gallindoi (sp?), not cubensis), k was going to do 25i and I was doing 4.4mg of DOC. Now up till this point I'd never had a bad trip. In fact, lsd and shrooms had made me more confident, gotten me off heroin, and made me generally happy about life. I always do my research as do these friends. I knew this stuff was long lasting and had a long comeup (iirc it's an amphetamine analogue). However when i was about halfway up i was hitting my limits. Shit was looking cool, I was having interesting thoughts, music was incredible and I could modify most of my sensory inputs however i wished. J and V had gone off to do their own thing. K was late getting to campus (forgot to mention we're all at a university). K decided to just play tripsitter since he was late. The problem occured when k, v, and I decided to go to dining hall. I didnt have much of an appetite and wasn't comfortable around all the people. I tell them I want to leave and head back to my room away from everyone but they don't want to waste their meal plans (its a buffet). So I head back to my room alone. Once I got there I was still coming up even more.   This is where things got bad. I felt like God. The world had fallen away and I'd entered a reality in which I could live forever and never sleep. There were points where I thought I was reliving the same day over and over again. There were points where I thought I was trapped but the issues were always the same. I wouldn't sleep and I would be there forever. Now these two issues scared me for a variety of reasons. I'm an insomniac and have been awake for days straight. It's hell and makes me miserable. It also lead to an ambien prescription that lead to some awful addiction/withdrawal issues so the thought of no sleep terrified me. The other issue with living forever was boredom. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to major in as nothing really interests me and Im scared of winding up unsatisfied with life.   So basically I thought I was going to live forever in a hell made out of two of my biggest fears. I tried reminding myself that I was tripping and I'd be ok but it felt so damn real. Thankfully, I'm prescribed triazolam now (an extremely potent benzo). I swallowed all that I had (i believe about 15 .25mg pills) in an attempt to kill myself to escape but it just knocked me out and woke up with that benzod out feeling you get when you take too many.
a new city always changes a player's game. ok so he may not be as good with the puck as some other defenseman, but i think our management is seeing that we have several great puck moving defenseman rapidly becoming all stars/recognizable names (Fowler, Vatanen, Lindholm). our blueline honestly doesn't look as terrible as everyone keeps saying, if you asked me. Stoner gives us something that the Kings stuffed down our throats-GRIT. I think we're a fancy, high-flying (no pun intended), high scoring type of team. someone who won't pinch as often, someone who may help us flesh out our neutral zone game coming towards our own end can't hurt. i'm excited to have him honestly.
EDIT:  NOMINATIONS NOW CLOSED.  Working on a tally for the voting phase.   Hello /r/Android!  I'm Pixel-Freak a regular contributor of /r/Androidgaming and operator of the Android gaming (and sometimes indie gaming) focused YouTube Channel  [PixelFreakGames](  I recently had an idea  [which I posted on /r/Androidgaming]( to create a Redditor sourced Top 25 Android games list and make a video covering those games.  I think this list could use broader appeal for nominations so I am reaching out to you in an effort to make this list as wide reaching and democratic as possible.   If that isn't enough explanation...   What I Plan To Do :   In the submission linked above I am currently gathering nominations for games that should be included.  Using those nominations (partly subjectively if the nominations list is exceedingly long) I will create a survey of sorts and present it to the involved communities to vote on what games should be included in the Top 25.  Note that this list is not limited to games released in 2013, but any game released on Android in the entire history of forever.   Based on the results from the survey I will first create a video on YouTube that quotes various users from the nominations and explains each game and why we as a community voted it up, but I will also create text posts here with the hopes that mods from (at least) /r/AndroidGaming will sticky the list until they see fit.   Why This is Necessary :   Top game lists come out all the time from various publications and each time we see the exact same games from EA, Gameloft, Ubisoft, Gamevil, and any other major developer.  Usually the list describes each game with a level ineptitude that only someone that hadn't even installed the game could muster.  This is not only a disservice to the readers of such lists, but a slap in the face to every small indie dev that makes amazing games that never get noticed.  As someone that is in the trenches everyday with these games and their struggling creators, I think it's time to give credit where credit is due rather than just picking games based on who had the biggest marketing budget.   I appreciate the time of those that have read this far, and would further appreciate an upvote for exposure from the /r/Android community.
No mija! Ni cerca: Nuca saque tarjeta de credito, nunca pedi el puto cupo, nunca lo raspe, nunca viaje ni pa cujicito, y en resumen: pelin bolin.
I'm 24M. She's 23F. We've been together for 5 months. Although that isn't very long, it's somewhat crunch time because I'm moving to the west coast for a job and she wants to come move there with me, but I'm simply not sure if I'm ready for that kind of commitment for a few reasons.   On the plus side, she's absolutely passionate about our relationship. She makes me laugh and is a great girlfriend.   On the other hand, I feel that we don't match in a lot of ways: we deal with arguments in opposite ways (I'd rather mull on things while I cool off for a day or so whereas she needs to figure things out  now ). I'm a thinker and thoroughly enjoy deep conversations about certain topics, but she has no interest in those topics, and we've never had a deep conversation. Her only actual passion in life is shopping; this is somewhat of a turnoff for me since I feel that I've invested so much into myself in various ways.   So I'm just torn right now. Should I go along with her, knowing that she'll love me until we grow old together, or should I risk that in hopes of finding someone more compatible?   If anything, how do I even begin to sort out this decision? I've been confused for a while now.
Greetings Everyone,   I hope this is also the correct place, it isn't a yes or no question and search didn't show a similar topic, it is a bit of a challenge, but doesn't fit programming or gaming. This seemed to be the most fitting sub.   -/-The Problem-- I own Emperor: Battle For Dune and wanted to create a portable version, so I don't have to go around installing it on every computer I want to play on.   -/-The Attempt-- Sadly enough after performing the following steps:       Install on pc (Win7 x64)         Copy directory to usb         Install 1.09 patch         Use 1.09 NO-CD         Copy disk 2-4 content to folders       ---done-- It does not work.     I can put in the USB stick in the original computer(even after renaming/moving the original install directory) and it will run just fine, but on my other computer it just crashes after the intro movies.   I tried manually installing: VBRUN60.EXE, but that didn't help.   -/-The Solution?-- I suspect it is a missing component/registry from the setup, as it works on the original pc from the USB, but not on the new ones.   So my plan:       Take 3rd computer         Back-up registry         Install Emperor         Back-up registry again         Scan registry(backups) for changes, hoping to find missing components/entries         What would you suggest? What if I need to find some components that aren't in the registry? I've enough computers to keep trying, but I would like to get it after the next computer.   Thank you very much for reading!
At the suggestion of a friend after having vapors tongue for a day i tried whiskey chased with pickle juice. It did jack shit except taste so bad i started speaking in tongues for a couple seconds.  After it was all said and done all it too was rehydrating well and brushing my teeth/tongue well. Took about an hour after drinking the mass quantities of water for my taste to be on par.
Cezera awakes to her normal business... but she seems... smaller? Odd but nothing to be concerned about. Until she finds a note at her door   "Undoing your seal, something didn't go as planned. Things might be changing. Find help."   "Shit..."   she packs up her things and runs off to find someone she'd been looking for.   [
